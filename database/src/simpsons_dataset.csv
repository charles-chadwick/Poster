Miss Hoover,"No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it."
Lisa Simpson,Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
Miss Hoover,I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?
Lisa Simpson,That life is worth living.
Edna Krabappel,"The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?"
Martin Prince,I don't think there's anything left to say.
Edna Krabappel,Bart?
Bart Simpson,Victory party under the slide!
,
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
Landlady,"Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume."
Lisa Simpson,Do you know where I could find him?
Landlady,I think he's taking the next train to Capital City.
Lisa Simpson,"The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
Landlady,"Yes, and it's been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point."
Lisa Simpson,"I see he touched you, too."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, thanks for your vote, man."
Nelson Muntz,I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.
Bart Simpson,"Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls."
Terri/sherri,We forgot.
Bart Simpson,"Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh oh.
Bart Simpson,Lewis?
Bart Simpson,Somebody must have voted.
Milhouse Van Houten,"What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?"
Bart Simpson,Uh oh.
Bart Simpson,
Wendell Borton,Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
,
Bart Simpson,I demand a recount.
Edna Krabappel,"One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Edna Krabappel,"Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin."
Kid Reporter,"This way, Mister President!"
,
Conductor,"Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, andâ€¦.."
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!"
BERGSTROM,"Hey, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Lisa, indeed."
BERGSTROM,What? What is it?
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
BERGSTROM,"Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what."
Lisa Simpson,You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
BERGSTROM,"Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who..."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, please."
BERGSTROM,"No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City."
Lisa Simpson,But I need you too.
BERGSTROM,That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
Lisa Simpson,"I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you."
BERGSTROM,I'll tell you what...
BERGSTROM,"Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know."
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
Conductor,All aboard!
Lisa Simpson,"So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
BERGSTROM,"Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note."
,
Homer Simpson,Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
Homer Simpson,"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
Lisa Simpson,Nothing.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, tell your father."
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Bergstrom left today.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Lisa Simpson,He's gone. Forever.
Homer Simpson,And?
Lisa Simpson,I didn't think you'd understand.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!"
Homer Simpson,Me?
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
Homer Simpson,I don't think you realize what you're saying.
Lisa Simpson,Baboon!
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her."
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy."
Homer Simpson,Go Away.
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
Lisa Simpson,No!
Homer Simpson,Nuts.
Homer Simpson,This isn't going well at all.
Lisa Simpson,"Look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
Homer Simpson,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,That was our wedding.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Marge Simpson,"Children, it's time for you to go to bed."
Homer Simpson,"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
Lisa Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
Lisa Simpson,You're so silly.
Homer Simpson,Gimme a banana.
Lisa Simpson,I don't have any banana.
Homer Simpson,"Come on, you're holding out on me."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Think nothing of it.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Would you have to do extra work?
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, no."
Homer Simpson,"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
Bart Simpson,"Hey! Thanks, monkey-man."
Homer Simpson,Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
Homer Simpson,Uh oh.
Homer Simpson,"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
Homer Simpson,"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
,
Homer Simpson,Mmm... hors doovers.
Marge Simpson,Homer! You promised!
Homer Simpson,I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. We've never thrown a party. Now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes."
Lisa Simpson,"But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
Homer Simpson,"Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah."
Marge Simpson,Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
Homer Simpson,How do I look?
Marge Simpson,Do we have enough glasses?
Homer Simpson,Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Marge Simpson,Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
Homer Simpson,What are all our friends names again?
Marge Simpson,Children! Go!
Ned Flanders,"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
Moe Szyslak,College boy.
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?"
Homer Simpson,Why not? I paid for it.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
Ned Flanders,"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
Homer Simpson,Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
Marge Simpson,"Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,
,
,
Barney Gumble,"Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you, but I don't remember you being so beau --tiful."
Barney Gumble,Ow! Hey! Jeez!
Barney Gumble,Is that a new kind of Mace? It's really painful.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink."
Homer Simpson,It was me! You fell for it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Homer, these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary."
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
Homer Simpson,Bart! Come over here.
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
Bart Simpson,Yes sir.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,That thing you know how to do.
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,Go to bed.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
Barney Gumble,"Oh, Homer, you're the king!"
Homer Simpson,"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
Husband Of Marge's Friend,"Homer, I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago."
Homer Simpson,You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
Husband Of Marge's Friend,"Uh, gee Homer, don't quit..."
Homer Simpson,All right then.
Homer Simpson,Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
Maude Flanders,Oh sure.
Homer Simpson,Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,
Barney Gumble,"Hey, thanks for invitin' me. I had a wonderful time."
Marge Simpson,I must apologize for my husband.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you roll him onto his side."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Remember, I said if."
Marge Simpson,I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Homer Simpson,Why? What'd you do?
Homer Simpson,Marge!
Marge Simpson,Come here!
Homer Simpson,Where-where are we going?
Marge Simpson,Shhh.
,
Marge Simpson,"I want to make sure the kids don't hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
,
Bart Simpson,They're fighting in the car again.
Lisa Simpson,That music always sends a chill down my spine.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?"
Homer Simpson,The way I acted?
,
Homer Simpson,So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
Sophisticate #1,Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!
Homer Simpson,I put it there.
Sophisticate #1,You did?
Homer Simpson,I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Sophisticate #1,Pure hilarity!
Sophisticate #2,Pure Homer!
Sophisticate #3,I pronounce it to be the most whimsical jape of the season!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church."
Marge Simpson,I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
Homer Simpson,"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
,
Homer Simpson,About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
Bart Simpson,I understand why. You were wasted.
Homer Simpson,I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will."
Homer Simpson,Aw.
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including ""Bible Bafflers"", ""Satan's Boners,"" ""Good Grief! More Satan's Boners"" and, for the teens, ""It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."""
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Reverend."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Sit down, Homer."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It's psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread...
Marge Simpson,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,... or those just in need of a tune-up.
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea."
Homer Simpson,Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
Marge Simpson,We'll be there!
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!"
Bart Simpson,Now you wanna go?
Homer Simpson,They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
Marge Simpson,We're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. No fishing.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that must be the babysitter."
Marge Simpson,Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
Sultan,Simpson... Simpson...
Bart Simpson,"Come back for more, eh?"
Marge Simpson,Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
Homer Simpson,"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth."
Bart Simpson,What do you need a babysitter for? I'm almost ten and a half.
Lisa Simpson,Mom! You wouldn't dare.
Bart Simpson,"Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand."
Homer Simpson,"No, you don't!"
Marge Simpson,Grampa?
Grampa Simpson,Huh... who?... what?
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, could you do something?"
Grampa Simpson,I can dress myself.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk."
Marge Simpson,"Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
Grampa Simpson,Just give me the list. I can read.
Marge Simpson,"All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves."
Marge Simpson,Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
Grampa Simpson,I heard that.
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do."
Grampa Simpson,Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You're allowed smoke cigars?
,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, bait."
,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, better get some gas."
Homer Simpson,Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
,
Worm Man,Where ya headed?
Homer Simpson,Catfish Lake.
Worm Man,"Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?"
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?"
Worm Man,He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.
Worm Man,... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, who says that?"
Worm Man,They do.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Worm Man,"Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though."
Homer Simpson,Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
,
Bart Simpson,"After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
Bart Simpson,"Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? But right now my gut's telling me... Bleed Gramps dry."
,
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome!"
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen."
HELEN,Hel-lo Marge!
Ned Flanders,"Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
Homer Simpson,"None of your business, Flanders."
Homer Simpson,Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that."
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.
Homer Simpson,I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don't we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they're here. John... Gloria?"
Gloria,"My name's Gloria. I'm here because Johnny boy hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I'd want his odor of gin and sour defeat pressed against me."
John,"That's enough, Gloria!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Thank you, Gloria. John, why don't you tell us a little about why you're here?"
John,"She never cooks, she keeps a filthy house and she talks profanely. She's the Queen of the Harpies."
Gloria,"No, I'm not!"
John,Queen of the Harpies!
Gloria,"No, I'm not!"
John,"Here's your crown, your Majesty."
Gloria,"Get away from me, swine."
John,Queen of the Harpies!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"You've come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other's eyes."
John,Your eyes? I'd forgotten how beautiful they are.
Gloria,Let's never fight again.
John,We were fools to argue.
Gloria,Let's not talk about that.
John,Let's not talk at all.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here?"
Ned Flanders,Well...
Maude Flanders,"Go on, Neddie."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
Homer Simpson,Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, why are you here?"
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?"
Homer Simpson,She's perfect.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Come on, Homer. What are her faults?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn."
Homer Simpson,I'm done.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Okay. Marge?
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Homer."
Marge Simpson,"He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
Homer Simpson,It's true. It's all true.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, don't interrupt."
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Marge Simpson,"He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
Homer Simpson,I only did that a couple of times.
,
Lisa Simpson,Half a gallon of chocolate.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Lisa Simpson,Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Lisa Simpson,"Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
Bart Simpson,Check.
Grampa Simpson,Did your Mom really write that shopping list?
Lisa Simpson,"Grampa, what a question?"
Bart Simpson,"What's next, Lis?"
Lisa Simpson,Sprinkles and syrup.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it."
Grampa Simpson,"Well, all right, but put out that cigar."
,
Marge Simpson,"... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, we've missed the luau. What say we call it a night?"
,
Captain,"I don't want to hear it, McBain. That cannon of yours is against regulations. In this department we go by the book."
Grampa Simpson,"You know, kids, it's gettin' pretty late."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day."
Lisa Simpson,It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
,
Homer Simpson,"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?"
Homer Simpson,Would this be a good time to be honest?
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
Marge Simpson,Get back in bed.
Homer Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
Marge Simpson,Sure.
,
Homer Simpson,Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
,
Marge Simpson,Homer?
,
Grampa Simpson,Sugar?
Lisa Simpson,Yes. Ten please.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Grampa, top me off."
Grampa Simpson,Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?
Bart Simpson,"For the last time, yes!"
,
Homer Simpson,Good! Give up!
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart's joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square."
,
Otto Mann,"Tell my friends? All right, but I've got some pretty funky friends."
,
Convict,All right! I get out at noon and I'm already invited to a party.
,
Helen Lovejoy,"Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you."
Marge Simpson,Do I have to do this?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No. Even if your husband were here, I wouldn't recommend it. Marge, as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where I've ever told one partner that they were 100 percent right. It's all his fault, and I'm willing to put that in a certificate you can frame."
,
Grampa Simpson,Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
Grampa Simpson,That the Yanks are comin'...
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
Homer Simpson,Whoa! Holy mackerel!
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, good to see you, pal. What's happening, man?"
Otto Mann,"Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight?"
Bart Simpson,"Not yet, but the afternoon is young."
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, what's wrong?"
Lisa Simpson,Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
Bart Simpson,"You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey you, no, shut that door! Stop it! Put that away! No, stop, oh!"
Grampa Simpson,OW!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw haw!
Grampa Simpson,"You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt?"
Nelson Muntz,Yeah.
Grampa Simpson,All right. I'll show you.
Nelson Muntz,Haw! Haw! Haw!
Grampa Simpson,Doggone it!
,
Homer Simpson,"I love you, but I must kill you."
,
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, take care, man. Hey, thanks for coming. Hey, nice tie, Nelson.."
Nelson Muntz,"Ah, thanks, it's your dad's."
Grampa Simpson,"I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! I'm a feeb... a useless old... worn-out..."
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before."
Lisa Simpson,"It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
Bart Simpson,"Well, how do you make this feeling go away?"
Lisa Simpson,You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
,
Homer Simpson,I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
Homer Simpson,"Uh, oh."
Homer Simpson,"Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?"
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Marge Simpson,"We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. Homer, how can you expect me to believe...."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero."
Marge Simpson,To who?
Homer Simpson,To those weirdos in the worm store.
Marge Simpson,All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
Marge Simpson,"Oh yeah, sure."
Homer Simpson,Watch.
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby."
Marge Simpson,"Ohhh, Homer."
,
Homer Simpson,We're back!
Lisa Simpson,How's your marriage?
Homer Simpson,Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
Marge Simpson,"Oh my, the house looks wonderful. Grampa, what's your secret?"
Grampa Simpson,"Pretending to cry. That's right, you heard me. Pretending to cry. I can turn it on and off like a fawcet. Boo-hoo, Oh, I'm crying, I'm so sad."
Lisa Simpson,"Way to go, Grampa."
Bart Simpson,I'll never trust another old person.
Grampa Simpson,I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
,
Worm Man,"Yup. General Sherman. They say he's 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know? No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he's a hundred years if he's a day."
Customer,"And uh, no one's ever caught him?"
Worm Man,"Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. And his eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of hell."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
Bart Simpson,Wow! Number nine! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward.
Bart Simpson,What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
Lisa Simpson,"I think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
Bart Simpson,"Well, you know what I think? I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, they do look alike!"
Bart Simpson,I wonder how Richie died?
Lisa Simpson,"Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
Marge Simpson,"Kids, could you lighten up a little?"
Bart Simpson,"Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool."
Lisa Simpson,He's no wittier than the next superhero.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, ""Hot enough for ya?"""
Lisa Simpson,I stand corrected.
Marge Simpson,We're here!
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
Bart Simpson,This looks like a discount for...
Bart Simpson,Bartman!
Ticket Seller,Who are you supposed to be?
Bart Simpson,I'm Bartman!
Ticket Seller,Never heard of him. Full price.
Bart Simpson,Lousy rip off...
DIAMOND JOE,"Is uh, this on?... Ahem, young people of Springfield: As your Mayor, I'd like to welcome you to our annual funny book convention, and thank you for pumping almost three hundred dollars into the local economy."
DIAMOND JOE,Your youthful high spirits have imparted a glow to this old war-horse. You might say I feel like Radiation Man!
Jimbo Jones,"That's Radioactive Man, jerk!"
DIAMOND JOE,"I stand corrected... Well, have fun and be sure to clear out by six for the Shriners. Get that punk's name. No one makes a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby."
Martin Prince,"Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear?"
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Lost And Found Guy,"Let's see, we've got a utility belt, a couple of tricorders, a light saber... Sorry, kid."
Otto Mann,"Hey, Bart-dude!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?"
Otto Mann,"My very own idea for a comic book, little man. It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone!"
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Milhouse Van Houten,"C'mon, Bart. We're going to see Buddy Hodges."
Bart Simpson,The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
Milhouse Van Houten,Yep.
Bart Simpson,"Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam."
Radioactive Man,Aaahh... These Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.
Fallout Boy,"Gee whillikers, Radioactive Man. Wisht I was old enough to smoke Laramies."
Radioactive Man,"Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen."
Radioactive Man,Look out!
Announcer,Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the earth?
Convention Director,"Well, wasn't that great?... Y'know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember actor Dirk Richter for his portrayal of Radioactive Man, and not the sordid details of his final years, so let's keep the questions tasteful, okay? Now how about a big welcome for Buddy ""Fallout Boy"" Hodges!"
BUDDY,Any questions?
Milhouse Van Houten,"When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum in issue two-thirty-four, how come his costume shrinks, too?"
BUDDY,"I am sure I don't know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of ""Cats"" -- anybody see it?"
Bart Simpson,"Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me."
BUDDY,"Yes, you, the masked boy."
Bart Simpson,Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
BUDDY,Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can't you little vultures leave him alone?
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Radioactive Man number seventy-two! It's the imaginary tale where Radioactive Man marries Larva Girl."
Dealer,Tell you what. I'll show you something very special if you promise to put your grubby little hands behind your back and keep 'em there.
Dealer,Behold!
Bart Simpson,Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
Dealer,None other.
Bart Simpson,I bet it's worth a million bucks!
Dealer,"It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me."
Bart Simpson,All I got is thirty.
Dealer,Then you cannot have it.
Bart Simpson,"But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book."
Dealer,"Your emotion is out of place here, son."
,
Marge Simpson,"So, did you kids have fun?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes."
Marge Simpson,Ohhh.
Homer Simpson,I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!"
Bart Simpson,"All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!"
Homer Simpson,"All right, what are you getting at?"
Bart Simpson,I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
Homer Simpson,"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world."
Homer Simpson,"Well, t.s."
,
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Please Dad.
Homer Simpson,"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Are you?
Bart Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!"
Marge Simpson,"Don't gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma..."
,
Young Patty,We'll give you half our allowance.
Young Selma,Uh-huh. But you have to be our slave.
Young Patty,This gives us a lot more free time.
Young Selma,Uh-huh. Let's take up smoking.
Marge Simpson,"For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
Older Patty,"Venus... Oh, Venus..."
Older Selma,We want those dress-shields hand-washed and drip-dried.
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Mrs. Glick,Here we are.
Marge Simpson,"But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
,
Marge Simpson,So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. You're already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --"
Lisa Simpson,"She means you should get a job, stupid."
Bart Simpson,Me?
Adult Narrator,"Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever."
Homer Simpson,Bart! What are you staring at?
Bart Simpson,Uh... nothing.
Adult Narrator,"He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever..."
Homer Simpson,Bart! Stop it!
Bart Simpson,Sorry.
,
Bart Simpson,I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH
Bart Simpson,Empty bottles... empty bottles...
Bart Simpson,"Hm... well, it's practically empty."
,
Bart Simpson,"Here you go, Apu."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?"
Bart Simpson,"No, not today. I need the dime."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade."
,
Bart Simpson,Ah-ha!
,
Bart Simpson,"Americanize this, my good man."
Teller,Okey dokey.
Bart Simpson,All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Teller,Let the good times roll.
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek."
Lisa Simpson,"How's it going, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see...
Lisa Simpson,"Ah ha, now you look pathetic."
Bart Simpson,Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see... ... Ah!
Bart Simpson,"Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up."
Barney Gumble,"Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? I'm a little short this week."
Bart Simpson,Beat it.
Eddie,"Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella?"
Bart Simpson,"Ugh, my dog ate it."
Lou,Gotta have a license to sell beer.
Bart Simpson,Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
Eddie,"We-ell, seeing as how it's a first offense..."
Lou,I guess we can overlook this.
Bart Simpson,"So long, officers. Uh-oh."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's all the --"
Homer Simpson,My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
,
Marge Simpson,The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
Mrs. Glick,"A comic book! Oh, my, boys never change. Which one is it, ""Nazi Smasher""?"
Marge Simpson,I don't think so.
Mrs. Glick,"Send him over to my house, I got a few chores he could do. He knows how to mix whitewash, don't he?"
,
Bart Simpson,Mrs. Glick?
Mrs. Glick,"Eh, you must be Burt Simpson! Well, you look like you've got a strong young back!"
Mrs. Glick,"Would you like something to eat? I've got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy."
Bart Simpson,"No, thanks. Who's that?"
Mrs. Glick,"Oh, that's my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long."
,
Asa,"This one's for you Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in D Company: Yeah! Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie. He ain't so stuck-up once you get to know..."
Mrs. Glick,"Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy."
Bart Simpson,"No, thanks."
Mrs. Glick,Boys love candy.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yes, ma'am!"
Bart Simpson,"Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am."
Mrs. Glick,"We'll start with a little light yard work. And when you're done, you can have a nice barley pop."
,
Mrs. Glick,I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds?
Bart Simpson,All of 'em?
Mrs. Glick,Good boy.
Mrs. Glick,Now be careful with these. I'll be inside watching my stories.
Bart Simpson,Ow!. . .Ow!
Soap Actress,"Jack, please. I'm married."
Soap Actor,That must be what's turning me on.
Soap Actress,Oh... Stop it... some more.
Mrs. Glick,"Filthy, but genuinely arousing."
Bart Simpson,Finished.
Mrs. Glick,"Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! I'll get the iodine."
Mrs. Glick,"Now, don't fidget."
Bart Simpson,"Listen, lady, you don't have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!"
Mrs. Glick,They've never improved on iodine.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Mom."
Marge Simpson,Did you make any money?
Bart Simpson,"Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
Bart Simpson,There's a reason.
Mrs. Glick,"The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it?"
Bart Simpson,"I'll sludge you, you old bat."
Mrs. Glick,"Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is?"
Bart Simpson,"Some old lady thing, nobody's heard about for fifty years?"
Mrs. Glick,"No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress."
Bart Simpson,"Great story, lady."
Bart Simpson,Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
Bart Simpson,"No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!"
,
Mrs. Glick,"Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've been looking forward to this."
Chimp,
Mrs. Glick,Two quarters.
Bart Simpson,Two quarters?
Mrs. Glick,"You deserve every penny. You know, I've told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too."
Bart Simpson,Two quarters!
Mrs. Glick,"Bart, you didn't say thank you."
Bart Simpson,"Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that I am saying thank you."
Mrs. Glick,"You're welcome. All right then, off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies."
,
Bart Simpson,"Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her..."
Homer Simpson,"What's the problem, boy?"
Bart Simpson,"I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
Bart Simpson,Really?
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps."
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
,
Martin Prince,Can you let me have it for forty dollars?
Dealer,Forty bucks? Forget it! You made me get off my stool for that?
Martin Prince,"It's all I've got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!"
Dealer,No way. What do you want?
Bart Simpson,Can I have it for thirty-five?
Dealer,"No!... No!... Freakin' kids. I do not need this, I've got a Masters degree in folklore and mythology."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Excuse me, do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973, when he had big sideburns?"
Dealer,"Show me the thirty bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't gettin' off the stool."
Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of ""Radioactive Man No. 1"" right now!"
Martin Prince,Wow!
Dealer,"Here you go. ""Muttonchop Yaz."""
Milhouse Van Houten,I don't want it.
Dealer,Freakin' kids!
Bart Simpson,"Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""Radioactive Man No. 1"". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
Dealer,Yes sir.
Bart Simpson,"Wow! Breathe it in, boys!"
Martin Prince,This is the stuff dreams are made of.
Milhouse Van Houten,It smells like my grandpa.
Bart Simpson,"Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home."
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
Dealer,Looks like you bought more than you bargained for.
,
Radioactive Man,My pants... caught on barbed wire... Good Lord Choke... an A-bomb!
Radioactive Man,Yaarrgh!
Radioactive Man,"I'm becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man."
Milhouse Van Houten,So that's how it happened!
Martin Prince,I would've thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him.
Bart Simpson,Now you know better.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Turn the page, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like."
Milhouse Van Houten,Why can't we keep it at my house?
Bart Simpson,Your house? That's crazy talk!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, the comic's ours as much as it is yours."
Martin Prince,"How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays."
Bart Simpson,Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten,Wait a minute. What about Sunday?
Bart Simpson,Yeah. What about Sunday?
Martin Prince,"Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine."
Bart Simpson,Perfect.
Milhouse Van Houten,Wait a minute. What about zero?
Bart Simpson,Yeah! What about zero?
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah.
Martin Prince,"Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by ""Rock, Scissor, Paper"" competition. Best three out of five, how's that?"
Martin Prince,"Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I'll be taking my comic and..."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here."
Martin Prince,"If the comic book stays right here, then so do I."
Milhouse Van Houten,Me too!
Bart Simpson,"Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like."
Milhouse Van Houten,I want to read it again.
Bart Simpson,"Nice try, mister."
Martin Prince,"Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it."
Bart Simpson,"What do you mean, the last one alive?"
Martin Prince,I meant years from now.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, sure you did."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, don't push him!"
Bart Simpson,"I knew it. You're both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson."
Marge Simpson,I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Thank you, Mrs. Simpson."
Bart Simpson,"Sweet dreams, boys."
,
,
Bart Simpson,One more step and you're a dead man.
Martin Prince,"I have to go to the bathroom, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right, so do I, but you don't see me gettin' up."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, what's going on?"
Bart Simpson,Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Milhouse Van Houten,Let's tie him up!
Martin Prince,"Bart, is this how you treat all your guests?"
Bart Simpson,"Hmp, impressive."
Bart Simpson,"Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him."
Milhouse Van Houten,Okay. I'll go first.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, so that's your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, it is not going to happen, see?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"You're going crazy, Bart. I'm telling your mom!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers."
Martin Prince,I don't know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom?
Milhouse Van Houten,You can't stop me.
Bart Simpson,The hell I can't!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
Homer Simpson,They're fine.
,
Martin Prince,"Bart, the comic!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Don't let go of me Bart!
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit."
Milhouse Van Houten,"No, Bart! No!"
Martin Prince,"You know, if you guys hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak."
Bart Simpson,Shut up! Shut up!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Help me, Bart! I didn't even want the comic. I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big side-burns."
Marge Simpson,"Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, Mom."
Marge Simpson,Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
Martin Prince,"I'd raise my hand, Mrs. Simpson, if I could."
,
Homer Simpson,
Martin Prince,"It's no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came."
Bart Simpson,We worked so hard and now it's all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
Milhouse Van Houten,What's your point?
Bart Simpson,Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
Radioactive Man,"Well, the world is safe again... but for how long?"
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do."
Homer Simpson,"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"And now, I would like to present the man who made this sign possible, by dropping the last of his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns."
Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns is never late. Something must be terribly wrong.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well, there better be. Nobody leaves Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries!
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, no, Mr. Burns! We've got to get a doctor!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Mmmm. Mr. Burns is suffering from what we medical men call hypohemia. In layman's terms it's quite simply a lack of blood.
Waylon Smithers,"Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot! I know what hypohemia is. What I want to know is what can we do about it?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, at this point, our only hope is a transfusion."
Waylon Smithers,How long does it take to sterilize a needle?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,A few seconds.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, skip it."
Waylon Smithers,Just leave me enough to get home.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I'm afraid it's not that simple. His blood type is Double-O-Negative. It's quite rare.
Waylon Smithers,But I'm B positive. Damn this common gutter blood in my veins!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot."
,
Homer Simpson,How many hairs on my head? Without looking!
Waylon Smithers,Go ahead.
Chimp,
Waylon Smithers,"Attention all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death ... death's door. If you have type Double-O-Negative blood, I implore you to report to the Bloodmobile outside. That is all."
Carl Carlson,"I'd give him my blood, except for one thing."
Lenny Leonard,What's that?
Carl Carlson,I don't wanna.
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
Carl Carlson,"You know, Homer, I am your supervisor."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sir."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Maggie, look. What's that?"
Lisa Simpson,Lee-mur. Lee-mur.
Lisa Simpson,Zee-boo. Zee-boo.
Marge Simpson,"What are you doing, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, we did the best we could... What's a zebu?"
Lisa Simpson,"It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap."
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
Marge Simpson,A-Positive.
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it."
Lisa Simpson,"You know his blood type, how romantic."
Marge Simpson,A mother knows everything about her family.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?"
Marge Simpson,Four B.
Bart Simpson,How many teeth do I have?
Marge Simpson,"Sixteen permanent, eight baby."
Homer Simpson,Earmuffs.
Marge Simpson,XL.
Lisa Simpson,Ring.
Marge Simpson,"I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
Bart Simpson,Allergies.
Marge Simpson,Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
Bart Simpson,And?
Marge Simpson,Glow in the dark monster make-up.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
Marge Simpson,Bart does.
Homer Simpson,"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you have to help someone in need. It's the only decent thing to do."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?"
Bart Simpson,Is it a Bible story?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
Bart Simpson,How did a lion get rich?
Homer Simpson,It was the olden days!
Bart Simpson,Oh.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!"
Otto Mann,"Just a sec, man!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, Otto-man! You work here?"
Otto Mann,"Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude."
Homer Simpson,Now let's get the show on the road.
Otto Mann,Okay. Let me wash up.
Waylon Smithers,"Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first."
Homer Simpson,Eh.... the boy.
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,We're ready with the transfusion.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph."
C. Montgomery Burns,Charles... Montgomery... Burns.
Waylon Smithers,"Um, hmm."
C. Montgomery Burns,American Patriot
C. Montgomery Burns,... American Patriot.
C. Montgomery Burns,Master Of The Atom.
C. Montgomery Burns,Scourge Of The Despot.
C. Montgomery Burns,"""O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!"" Smithers, I'm back!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, top o' the mornin' to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old... you!"
Smitty,"Hi, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?"
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
,
Osvaldo,"Aye, caramba!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Heh-heh-heh! Well, that's game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!"
Waylon Smithers,"Just remarkable, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, Bart Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who?
Waylon Smithers,He's the son of Homer Simpson. One of your stiffs in Sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed."
,
Homer Simpson,"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!"
Homer Simpson,Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
Marge Simpson,The meaning of what?
Homer Simpson,"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
Homer Simpson,"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!"
Homer Simpson,Bart!
Marge Simpson,We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
Homer Simpson,"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter."
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"
Bart Simpson,You stink.
Homer Simpson,"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
Bart Simpson,An elephant's butt?
Homer Simpson,An elephant's butt.
,
Marge Simpson,But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
Homer Simpson,Yup!
Marge Simpson,"You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?"
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, Marge!"
Marge Simpson,"Please, Homie? For me?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works."
,
Homer Simpson,Cheap son-of-a...
Marge Simpson,Homer... Breakfast is ready.
Homer Simpson,Hmmm...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
Marge Simpson,Oh... thank you.
Homer Simpson,Where's the letter?
,
,
Homer Simpson,Where is it?
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!"
Homer Simpson,"Bart, have you seen the letter?"
Bart Simpson,Yup.
Homer Simpson,"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?"
Bart Simpson,The last place I saw it...
Homer Simpson,Uh huh.
Bart Simpson,...was in my hand...
Homer Simpson,Yeah...
Bart Simpson,...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Homer Simpson,Why did you do that?
Bart Simpson,"Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I..."
Homer Simpson,I'll show you mad in the morning.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself."
Homer Simpson,"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!"
,
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Bart Simpson,"Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight."
Homer Simpson,"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, I'm with you, Homer. Fight the power!"
Bart Simpson,"Why the hose, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
Homer Simpson,"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
Homer Simpson,"Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, the mailman is here."
Homer Simpson,That's a good one. We'll use that.
Bart Simpson,"No, I mean the mailman's here."
Homer Simpson,
Mail Person,Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
Mail Person,That's right.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm still gonna run!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest ghostwriters in the business."
Waylon Smithers,"He's written ""Like Hell I Can't!""... ""Up From The Muck""... and ""The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahbaradad!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Roman,"All right, all right. First question? Have you slept with anyone famous?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired."
,
,
Postal Worker,"Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
Homer Simpson,"Great plan, Bart."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results."""
,
Homer Simpson,Oops.
Homer Simpson,Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
C. Montgomery Burns,Can I help you?
Bart Simpson,"They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?"
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson.
,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I'll be on my --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, there's more. ""In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"""...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..."" ""...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?"
Joey,"Homer, I don't tell you how to do your job. Okay?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Senile,"" eh? ""Buck-toothed,"" am I? ""Bony arms,"" are they? ""Liver spots,"" did I? ""Chinless,"" will you?"
Waylon Smithers,"His pink slip awaits your signature, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp."
Waylon Smithers,"But, sir --"
C. Montgomery Burns,But what?
Waylon Smithers,"Nothing, sir."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Me and my big... letter writing pen!
Marge Simpson,"Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you."
,
Waylon Smithers,You know Homer Simpson?
Joey,"Yeah, nice guy. Play poker with him once in a while."
Waylon Smithers,"Hmmm huh. We uh, need him beaten up."
Joey,You got it.
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What is it?
Waylon Smithers,"Ah, nothing."
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What?
Waylon Smithers,"Beat, but don't kick."
Joey,Hold the kicks. Got it.
Waylon Smithers,Wait!
Joey,What?
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, um, umm..."
Joey,"Hey, what did Homie do anyway?"
Waylon Smithers,He saved Mr. Burns' life!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you. What's that you say? Me thanking you? No, it's not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah Smithers, how'd the beating go?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, uh... there was no beating."
C. Montgomery Burns,What? Well that's a hell of a thing! Why?
Waylon Smithers,Because... I... I called it off.
C. Montgomery Burns,Judas!
Waylon Smithers,"I'm sorry, sir. But I just couldn't hurt Homer Simpson. He saved your life."
C. Montgomery Burns,I see.
Waylon Smithers,"I know you're mad at me, but I think it's only fair to warn you, I'm going to stand outside the gate until you forgive me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober ""ying"" to my raging ""yang."" Put 'er there, old pal."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, while I wish this handshake would never end, I'm, I'm afraid we still have the Simpson matter to attend to."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed."
,
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink.
Bart Simpson,"Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch."
Moe Szyslak,"Hold on, I'll check. Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?"
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick."
Moe Szyslak,What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer Simpson,"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems."
Barney Gumble,"Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"We'll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooo, too practical."
C. Montgomery Burns,Too cutesy-poo.
C. Montgomery Burns,Too cornball.
C. Montgomery Burns,A pool table? Are you mad? I'm not gonna turn his home into a saloon.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Eureka! We've found it!
Waylon Smithers,"B-but, sir... it's thirty-two thousand dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, woe is me."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my! It's Mr. Burns."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
Lisa Simpson,"Wait, Dad, he's smiling."
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"To show there's no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, ""Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?"" And now, young fellow, I haven't forgotten you. Here."
Bart Simpson,Wow! A crowbar!
Lisa Simpson,"It's to open the crate, stupid."
Homer Simpson,"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
Bart Simpson,Wow! A big ugly head!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war."
Bart Simpson,Awesome!
Lisa Simpson,"No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what does it do?"
Marge Simpson,It doesn't do anything.
Homer Simpson,"Marge! Really, what does it do?"
Marge Simpson,"Whatever it does, it's doing it now."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'll let you get acquainted with SeÃ±or Xt'tapalatakettle. Ta!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Did you see their faces, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, you're my god of generosity."
Homer Simpson,"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, ""A good deed is its own reward."""
Bart Simpson,"Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!"
Marge Simpson,"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
Marge Simpson,"Well... then I guess the moral is, ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
Lisa Simpson,Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Homer Simpson,Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
Marge Simpson,But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Homer Simpson,Amen to that!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Lisa? It's six a.m. Something's wrong! Dad died!
Lisa Simpson,"No, no. He's fine."
Bart Simpson,"Well, what do you know? I'm relieved."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits."
Bart Simpson,"Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --"
Bart Simpson,Lisa did it.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?"
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
Bart Simpson,"Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, thank you."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry."
Bart Simpson,Can do.
Bart Simpson,Hm... Krusty hotline.
Krusty the Clown,"Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute."
Krusty the Clown,Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day.
Marge Simpson,Maggie!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!"
Bart Simpson,I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Homer Simpson,Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
Marge Simpson,I washed it.
Homer Simpson,"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
Marge Simpson,"Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
Marge Simpson,I don't know how this could have happened.
Bart Simpson,"Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!"
Homer Simpson,You! You did this to me!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?"
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir. He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist."
Waylon Smithers,"I'll call security, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves.
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey Homer, we saved you a doughnut."
Carl Carlson,It has pink frosting!
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
Guard #1,Drop that doughnut.
Guard #2,"Let's go, Pinky."
Homer Simpson,You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
C. Montgomery Burns,Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away!
Waylon Smithers,"You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79."
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?"
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the ""Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test."" Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is."
Homer Simpson,Print name?
,
Homer Simpson,"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you."
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?"
Bart Simpson,LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY /
Lisa Simpson,"Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote."
Homer Simpson,O-kay.
Lisa Simpson,"Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --"
Homer Simpson,No deal.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, maybe you should do this."
Homer Simpson,"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
Host,"Our $50,000 Home Video Finalists are: ""Man Breaking Hip."""
Homer Simpson,
Host,Dog on Fire. Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog?
Homer Simpson,Look at him!
Host,"And finally, ""Baby With A Nail Gun."""
Homer Simpson,Awww.
Host,"Okay, it's time to cast your votes now."
Homer Simpson,Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"""
Homer Simpson,"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV."
Bart Simpson,"Yes. ""Are you quick to anger?"""
Homer Simpson,Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!
Bart Simpson,"Yes. ""Do you wet your pants?"" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident."
,
Homer Simpson,"So, did I pass?"
C. Montgomery Burns,No.
Waylon Smithers,"Careful, men. He wets his pants."
,
,
Homer Simpson,The devil with his fly open.
Psychiatrist,Right...
Homer Simpson,That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.
Psychiatrist,Good...
Homer Simpson,Arrghh!
Bart Simpson,HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /
Class,
Homer Simpson,The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
Psychiatrist,"Well, we have a very simple method."
Psychiatrist,Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane.
Orderly,Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.
Homer Simpson,Who are you?
MICHAEL,"Hi. I'm Michael Jackson, from the Jacksons."
Homer Simpson,"I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons."
Michael,I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
Michael,Michael Jackson.
Homer Simpson,Doesn't ring a bell.
Michael,Thriller?
Homer Simpson,What was that last one?
Michael,Thriller.
Homer Simpson,Nope.
Michael,"Well, how about this? BILLIE JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER / SHE'S JUST A GIRL WHO SAYS THAT I AM THE ONE / BUT THE KID IS NOT MY SON. HEE, HEE, HEE!"
Homer Simpson,Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
Michael,The moonwalk?
Homer Simpson,"No, that thing with your feet."
Michael,Here look. Just raise your heel a bit and put a little pressure on the ball of your foot.
Homer Simpson,
Michael,Hee hee hee...
Michael,You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?
Homer Simpson,Because I wore a pink shirt.
Michael,I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed.
Homer Simpson,What'd you wear?
Michael,"One white glove, covered with rhinestones."
Homer Simpson,Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me."
Michael,"Homer, this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that."
Homer Simpson,Okay. Five times nine.
Floyd,Forty-five.
Homer Simpson,Wowww.
Michael,"We call this guy the Chief. He's been here since 1968. Never says a word, never moves a muscle."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,Hello.
Chief Wiggum,"Well, it's about time somebody reach out to me."
Homer Simpson,"Gee, I gotta call my family."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god."
Michael,I could call them for you.
Homer Simpson,"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
,
Bart Simpson,"Joe's Crematorium. You kill 'em, we grill 'em."
Michael,Hello. Who is this?
Bart Simpson,"I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?"
Michael,I'm Michael Jackson.
Bart Simpson,The Michael Jackson? No way!
Michael,"It's true. I'm with your father, in a mental institution."
Bart Simpson,Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?
Michael,He could be. It's a big hospital.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?"
Michael,"Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles."
Bart Simpson,"Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?"
Michael,"I'm afraid not, Bart. Your father really needs your help. You don't want him to get a lobotomy, do you?"
Bart's Head,"Hmmmm, lobotomy..."
Homer Simpson,"That's all right, son."
Bart Simpson,"Well, there's probably a down-size I don't see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mom, Dad's in a mental institution."
Marge Simpson,Oh my God! Mother was right.
,
Michael,"Now Homer, don't you worry. Your family's gonna be here before you know it."
Wiseguy,"Forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty."
Homer Simpson,What's that?
Wiseguy,Dating a nurse.
,
Marge Simpson,I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.
Bart Simpson,"No, mom, you said poor house."
Marge Simpson,I said crazy house!
Bart Simpson,Poor house.
Marge Simpson,Crazy house!
Bart Simpson,Poor house.
Marge Simpson,Crazy house!
Voice On Phone,"Hello, you've reached the New Bedlam ""Wrongly Committed"" Hotline. All of our operators are currently busy. Please stay on the line."
,
Michael,"What's wrong, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared."
Michael,We all get scared once in a while. Maybe I can help you.
Michael,"HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME."

Dave,"Okay, so I was working at an insurance company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in the history of the firm. Okay? The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I got up and I couldn't leave the house. I just couldn't."
Homer Simpson,Was the door locked?
Dave,"No, I just couldn't face what was out there."
Homer Simpson,Was it raining?
Doctor,"No, Homer. Dave suffers from agoraphobia -- a fear of open areas and crowds. Please, Dave, go on."
Dave,"Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn't make that long drive to work."
Homer Simpson,Were you out of gas?
Homer Simpson,Baby.
Psychiatrist,"Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility."
Marge Simpson,"Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you'd see how sane he is."
Psychiatrist,You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord!
Homer Simpson,Mmm... pancakes.
Psychiatrist,"Oh, Mr. Simpson, you've got a visitor."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Marge!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie."
Psychiatrist,"Mr. Simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others."
Homer Simpson,"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?"
Psychiatrist,Of course.
Homer Simpson,Not insane.
Michael,"I'm proud of you, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
Michael,"Well, how about today? I'm only here voluntarily."
Homer Simpson,You are? Why?

Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose."
Homer Simpson,"Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
Michael,"Um Homer, I'm a vegetarian. And I don't drink."
Homer Simpson,Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
Michael,"Yes. Now Homer, please make sure he doesn't tell anybody I'm coming."
,
Bart Simpson,"Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse."

Bill,We've just been handed a bulletin from our Rock 'N' Rumor Department.
Marty,"That's right, Michael Jackson -- the Thriller himself -- is moonwalkin' his way right here to our very own Spring- field!"
Bill,"And while we go check it out, why don't you enjoy our seldom heard, extra longggg version of ""In-a-Gadda-da-Vida."""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Michael Jackson! Oh such a thing happens once in a blue moon. Do I dare to leave my post?
,
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"This is the most exciting thing to happen to our fair town since the uh Dalai Lama visited in 1952. And so, I hereby declare that Route 401, currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway, will henceforth be known as the Michael Jackson Expressway."
Kent Brockman,"And the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital."
Homer Simpson,Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.
Homer Simpson,Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see.
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,Huh? Huh?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,He's three hundred pounds.
Woman,He's white.
Moe Szyslak,He's dressed without flair.
Mayor Joe Quimby,What the hell made me think Michael Jackson would even visit this jerkwater burg?
Milhouse Van Houten,You owe us Michael Jackson.
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Don't ever show your face around here again, ya tool."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question: Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and I'm afraid to ask."
Bart Simpson,"You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask."
Lisa Simpson,"I thought so. Oh, Bart, you..."
Homer Simpson,Come off. I'm sane now.
Lisa Simpson,"Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
Michael,"Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Hey... you.
Bart Simpson,I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE /
Michael,"Bart, when I was a kid, I didn't have much money. So you know what I did when my sisters' birthdays rolled around?"
Bart Simpson,Stiffed 'em?
Michael,No. I wrote them a song. To show that I cared.
Bart Simpson,I can't write a song. I'm only ten.
Michael,Only ten? When I was your age I had six gold records.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient."
Michael,You'd be amazed how often I hear that.
Bart Simpson,Just leave me alone.
Michael,"Look boy, either Michael Jackson is some guy working in a recording studio in LA or he's here with you willing to work on this song. It's your choice. So long."
Bart Simpson,"Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I'll boil some coffee."
Bart Simpson,"LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA."
Michael,"Uh, no."
Michael,"Bart, we've got to get to your real feelings about your sister."
Bart Simpson,I don't have any.
Michael,"Well, let's go look at her. Maybe that will help."
Michael,"Ah, she looks sad."
Bart Simpson,That's cause she knows you're looking at her.
Lisa Simpson,"Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
Michael,"Bart, think. What happens to you when you turn eight?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, your training wheels come off your bike."
Michael,"Good. That's good. THE TRAINING WHEELS COME OFF YOUR BIKE / YOU START TO NOTICE BOYS YOU LIKE...HEE, HEE, HEE."
Bart Simpson,You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
Bart Simpson,Lisa... Lisa... Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,"Huh... wha-- Bart, it's six a.m."
Bart Simpson,"That's right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four --"

Leon Kompowsky,"Well, my work is done here."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Michael. What happened to your voice?"
Leon Kompowsky,"This is my real voice. My name is Leon Kompowski and I'm a brick layer from Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I was very angry until one day I just talked like this. All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and I was only doin' good on this earth, so I kept on doin' it. To make a tired point. Which one of us is truly crazy?"
Homer Simpson,Not me. I got this.
Lisa Simpson,"Bye, bye, Leon / Bye, roomie / Bye, Pardner / You're a credit to Dementia!"
Leon Kompowsky,See ya!

Homer Simpson,"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"
Homer Simpson,Huh? A check?
,
,
Teller,"Mr. Simpson, I can assure you this ""check"" of yours is non-negotiable."
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?"
Teller,"You see where it says ""VOID-VOID-VOID"" and ""This Is Not A Check""? ""Cash value one twentieth of a cent""? ""Mr. Banker, do not honor."""
Homer Simpson,Shut up.
,
Homer Simpson,I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
Lisa Simpson,I don't think real checks have exclamation points.
Marge Simpson,"Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, a cartoon."
Homer Simpson,"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth."
Marge Simpson,"No, it is not the truth, Homer. It's well documented that women are safer drivers than men."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Einstein. Put down your readin', it's lunchtime."
Homer Simpson,"Nah, you go ahead."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, You don't wanna eat? What'd ya do, get one of them stomach staples?"

,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who is that bookworm, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate."
,
TV Announcer,"We now return to Troy McClure and Delores Montenegro in ""Preacher with a Shovel."""
Troy McClure,"But irrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds."
Marge Simpson,You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
Miss Crowley,Important.
Homer Simpson,"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
Homer Simpson,"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
Homer Simpson,Those kids don't know what they're missing.
Lisa Simpson,Daaad!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, what gives, man?"
Homer Simpson,We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
Homer Simpson,Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He'll be killed!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article."
Homer Simpson,Don't be so...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're right."
Marge Simpson,Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute...
Homer Simpson,Hmph?
Marge Simpson,I thought you might want to snuggle.
Homer Simpson,"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
Marge Simpson,"Thank you, Homie."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, little meatloaf men!"
Lisa Simpson,"Where did you get the idea for this, Mom?"
Homer Simpson,Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!
Marge Simpson,It certainly has enriched our lives.
Homer Simpson,"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids."
Lisa Simpson,"Wait, Dad!"
Lisa Simpson,"Hm. An essay contest. ""Children under twelve""... ""Three hundred words""... ""Fiercely pro-American."" Sounds interesting."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do, too."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on."
Lisa Simpson,"What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
Marge Simpson,"How's it going, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,Not very well.
Miss Crowley,Very.
Homer Simpson,Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --
Marge Simpson,"Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I'd go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
Lisa Simpson,Yes!
Marge Simpson,"I don't know, I thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. Do kids still use that word, ""cool""?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, Mom."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, America. Inspire me."
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, a bald eagle."
Lisa Simpson,Hmm...
,
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine."
,
Nelson Muntz,"""So burn the flag if you must. But before you do, you'd better burn a few other things. You better burn your shirt and your pants. Be sure to burn your TV and car.

Lisa Simpson,"When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. Thank you."
Jasper Beardly,What do you think?
Female Judge,It's good. A little too good for an eight-year-old. Methinks I detect the sickly scent of the daddy.
Miss Crowley,Person.
Female Judge,"Mr. Simpson, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your daughter's essay. Lisa, will you excuse us?"
Lisa Simpson,Okay.
Dad,We the purple? What the hell was that?
Female Judge,Are you a professional writer?
Homer Simpson,Uh-uh.
Female Judge,Are you interested in politics or government?
Homer Simpson,
Female Judge,Are you interested in anything?
Homer Simpson,
Female Judge,Could you touch your nose for me?
Female Judge,"Lisa, after meeting your father, I've decided to award you an additional five points. Congratulations. You and your family are going to Washington!"
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
,
Flight Attendant,"Yes, sir. Can I get you something?"
Homer Simpson,"Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me."
Flight Attendant,I'll see what I can do.
Man #1,Steward!
Flight Attendant,"Little boy, I bet you'd like to visit the cockpit."
Bart Simpson,Oh baby!

Pilot,"And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle. Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats?"

Homer Simpson,Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!
Homer Simpson,"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I call first bedsies!"
Lisa Simpson,Bart! There's no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up.
Bart Simpson,"Well, okay, which one do you want?"
Lisa Simpson,Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one.
Bart Simpson,"Really, you want that one? It's all yours. Whatever you say."
Lisa Simpson,Why? What's wrong with it?

Truong/maria,Hello.

Lobbyist,"Now basically, what we want to do is cut her down."
Arnold,Huh uh.
Lobbyist,"As you can see in our artist's rendition it's full of old growth, just aging and festering away. In comes our logging company... to thin out the clutter. It's all part of nature's, y'know, cycle."
Arnold,"Well Jerry, you're a whale of a Lobbyist And I'd like to give you a logging permit. I would, but uh, this isn't like burying toxic waste. People are gonna notice those trees are gone."
Lobbyist,"Uh, Congressman... this is where it gets awkward, I... I never quite know how to put this... I just want to..."
Arnold,...Offer me a bribe?
Arnold,Ohhh... What is it?
Secretary,It's that little girl from Springfield who wrote the essay. Could be a good photo op.

Arnold,Well hi there! You must be Lisa Simpson.

Lisa Simpson,The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!.
Scratchy,
Marge Simpson,I think it means he's having a barbecue.

Homer Simpson,"Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave."

Homer Simpson,That was a joke?
Ned Flanders,"As of Friday, I'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
Ned Flanders,"No, I kid you not. Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years."
Neighborhood Guy,"What are you going to do, Ned?"
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."

Ned Flanders,"So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?"
Homer Simpson,Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
Homer Simpson,"Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, no. The Springfield Mall."
Maude Flanders,"Oh, here, you two. Make a wish."

Bart Simpson,Six. Seven if there's something good on.
Marge Simpson,Don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend."
Marge Simpson,"That's the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."

Woman,I am so sorry. How much do I owe you?
Ned Flanders,"Now, you put that money away. That was an accident."
Woman,"Really? Well, thanks. Could you validate my parking?"
Ned Flanders,Absotively posilutely.
Homer Simpson,"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?"
Ned Flanders,N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.

Akira,"Greetings. I am Akira, your guide on the path to true karate. And this is our map, the Art of War by Sun Tzu. It will teach us our most important lesson: we learn karate so that we need never use it."

Akira,"Ah, yes, the impetuousness of youth! For now, let us read."
Bart Simpson,"Akira, my good man. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?"
Akira,First you must fill your head with wisdom. Then you can hit ice with it.
Bart Simpson,"Yo, sensei, can I go to the bathroom?"
Akira,"You can, if you believe you can."
Bart Simpson,Paying money to read books... the hell with this.

Bart Simpson,"Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death."
Video Voice,Touch of death!

Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is?"
Homer Simpson,"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know."
Lisa Simpson,"It's the German term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
Lisa Simpson,Sour grapes.
Homer Simpson,"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything."
Marge Simpson,"So Bart, what did you learn in karate school today?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, I learned the touch of death."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, the touch of death."
Bart Simpson,"Permit me to demonstrate. Lisa, shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart, don't use the touch of death on your sister."
,
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh. Gotta get back to karate class.
Bart Simpson,You missed a spot.
Bart Simpson,"All right. Comin' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy. How was class?"
Bart Simpson,Today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that'll learn 'im."
,
Jimbo Jones,What'd ya swipe?
DOLPH,"An ""I Love Lefties"" shot glass."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Left-handed pinking shears.
Jimbo Jones,Pinking shears? Let's go to the Food Court and steal some baked potatoes.
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
Man Shopper,"Hey, I hear you validate parking tickets without purchase."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, right as rain. Or, as we say around here, left as rain."
Man Shopper,Just stamp the ticket.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, okay."
,
Barney Gumble,"Hey Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?"
Homer Simpson,Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Moe Szyslak,Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well actually, Moe..."
HOMER (CONT'D,I dunno.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis. Change the channel."
Lisa Simpson,You change it.

Bart Simpson,I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back.
Lisa Simpson,But Bart --

Homer Simpson,"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"

Waylon Smithers,"Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns' desk. Chop, chop!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name?"
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Hmm hmmm. I'm Monty Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hm. ""Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He's distracting the female employees."" Smithers..."
Waylon Smithers,"Got me, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh! It's a real one! ""No more apples in the vending machine, please."" Well, that's almost a sentence!"
Homer Simpson,"Can I leave, Mr. Burns?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, of course. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples."
Homer Simpson,But the note was asking you to --
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, now, now. Tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She'll make everything all right, I promise."
C. Montgomery Burns,Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
Homer Simpson,"Um, Mr. Burns..."
Ned Flanders,"Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Flanders."
,
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Ned Flanders,Are you sure you're not interested? Two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
Man,"Sorry, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!"
Ned Flanders,"Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut."
Homer Simpson,I'll give you twenty bucks for it.
Ned Flanders,"Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year."
Homer Simpson,"You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer, be reasonable."
Homer Simpson,Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!
Ned Flanders,"All right, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Twenty dollars?
Ned Flanders,Twenty dollars.
Homer Simpson,Now I don't want it.
Ned Flanders,What?
Homer Simpson,"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?"
Bart Simpson,"Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly."
Homer Simpson,Daddly-doodly.
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is the Flanders' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this?"
Homer Simpson,Only seventy-five beans!
Marge Simpson,Seventy-five dollars? Ned must be desperate!
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch."
Collection Agent,"Good afternoon, sir, I'm Chuck Ellis from the Springfield Collection Agency, and I'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many."
Collection Agent,"Does it make you feel good about yourself to owe people money? We've been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there."
Collection Agent,Oh.
Homer Simpson,Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?
Collection Agent,We don't make mistakes.
Collection Agent,Damn right-handed ledgers... can't write in these things...

Lisa Simpson,Hey!!
DOLPH,"Hey, look at me -- I'm Elvis, man."
Lisa Simpson,You give that back. That belongs to me! That's mine!
DOLPH,"If you want it, just take it."
DOLPH,Okay. We're sorry. This time we're really gonna give it to you.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, stop that."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Lis, something wrong?"
Lisa Simpson,Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate.
Bart Simpson,Uh oh.
DOLPH,"Oh, we're real scared."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Please don't hurt us, Bart!"
Jimbo Jones,"What are you gonna do, throw your diapers at us?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on, Bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there."
Bart Simpson,"I think they've learned their lesson already, Lis."
DOLPH,"No, we want to see the touch of death."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Yeah, come on Karate kid. Waste me!"
Lisa Simpson,It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
,
Ned Flanders,Homer! Over here!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
Ned Flanders,"Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
Homer Simpson,You're gonna live in your car?
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city!"

Ned Flanders,"Listen to that singing... those poor fools. Homer, I'm ruined."
Homer Simpson,I know!
Ned Flanders,"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
Homer Simpson,Why not?
Ned Flanders,I sold it to you for seven cents.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Ned Flanders,"You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's all my fault."
Ned Flanders,No it's not.
Homer Simpson,Yes it is.
Ned Flanders,"No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen. Homer, you were a true friend."
Homer Simpson,"No, I was a swine."
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?"
Ned Flanders,For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
Bear,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Homer, there's no point..."
Homer Simpson,I SAID DO IT!
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me."
Moe Szyslak,"A left-handed corkscrew? Oh, baby!"
Barney Gumble,"""Kiss Me, I'm Left-Handed""? That's a classic!"

Bart Simpson,Good mornin' world!
Bart Simpson,Ow!
,
Bart Simpson,Good morning Lisa!
Lisa Simpson,What are you so happy about?
Bart Simpson,"Why shouldn't I be happy? It's a beautiful day, my homework is done, I've got my mojo workin' and we're goin' on a field trip this afternoon."
Bart Simpson,And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.
Bart Simpson,Hey! It's not in here. You stole it!
Lisa Simpson,"No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's my badge, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh."
,
Bart Simpson,... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing...
Bart Simpson,You ate my homework?
Bart Simpson,I didn't know dogs really did that.

Bart Simpson,
,
Edna Krabappel,Bart Simpson! You're late! Go fill out a tardy slip.
Bart Simpson,But I'm only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? That's pretty damn late.
,
Bart Simpson,Hey girls! Look at me!
Bart Simpson,You can stop lookin' at me now.
Bart Simpson,
,
Edna Krabappel,"Well, it's nearly one o'clock. And you know what that means."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,My glasses.
,
Edna Krabappel,That's right. It's time for our field trip to the chocolate factory. I trust you all remembered to bring your permission slips.
Bart Simpson,
,
,
Bart Simpson,What a day.
,
Lisa Simpson,I'm gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate.
Ralph Wiggum,I'm gonna eat chocolate till I barf.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry, Bart, we'll find something fun for you to do."
Seymour Skinner,Ah! Here we are! Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA.
Bart Simpson,You're making me lick envelopes?
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it."
Bart Simpson,What kind of game?
Seymour Skinner,"Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record."
Bart Simpson,Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
Seymour Skinner,Yes... well... get started.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Oh my God. It's Cocoa Beanie himself.
Lisa Simpson,I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it's the only way he'll learn.
,
Troy McClure,"Welcome to the chocolate factory. I'm Troy McClure. You probably remember me from such films as ""The Revenge of Abe Lincoln"" and ""The Wackiest Covered Wagon in the West."" The history of chocolate starts with the ancient Aztecs."
Troy McClure,"In those days, instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package, chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf."
Troy McClure,"And instead of being pure chocolate like we have today, it was mixed with shredded tobacco. And they didn't eat it. They smoked it."
,
Seymour Skinner,"You didn't believe me when I said it would be fun, did you?"
Bart Simpson,No thir.
Bart Simpson,
Executive,"Please, kids, play sanitary."
,
Bart Simpson,Tan Die Doe Dow?
Seymour Skinner,What?
Bart Simpson,Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow.
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... Well there's still a minute to go... oh, why not! But don't you tell your teacher I let you go home early."
Bart Simpson,Die don't.
,
,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,What next?
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
,
Fat Tony,"Hey, what's with the kid?"
Bart Simpson,Hands off the material!
Legs,Whaddaya know! The kid's tough.
Louie,He's got spunk.
Fat Tony,"I wonder if he is lucky also. Pick a horse, kid. Shelbyville Downs. Third race. Make it a good one."
Bart Simpson,Eat my shorts.
Fat Tony,"Eat my shorts. Ah, okay. Let's see... Heyy... Wait a minute, you little punk! Eat My Shorts is in the fifth race. I said the third race!"
Bart Simpson,Don't have a cow.
Fat Tony,"Hmm... ""Don't have a cow"" in the third. Put a deuce on him."
Fat Tony,"While we are waiting to see how lucky you are, let me show you around. This is our bar, and over there is our slot machine and card tables...."
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Joey,Hey Boss! Here's the call for the third race.
Race Announcer,"...As they come out of the turn it's ""Sufferin Succotash"" by a neck over ""Yabbadabbadoo."" Two lengths back to ""Ain't I a Stinker"" and ""That's All Folks."" ""I Yam What I Yam"" can see them all. But here comes ""Donhavacow"" flyin' on the outside. And at the wire it's all ""Donhavacow!"""
Fat Tony,"Hey, I like this kid. I can't believe we were gonna shoot him. Can you mix drinks?"
Bart Simpson,I don't know.
Legs,I'll have a Manhattan.
Fat Tony,Make Legs a Manhattan.
Bart Simpson,I'm not sure I...
Fat Tony,Well?
Legs,Supoib.
,
Marge Simpson,You got a job? Doing what?
Bart Simpson,"Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin' cigars... you know -- a job."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, your father and I don't want you doing that. Homer, say something."
Homer Simpson,How much does it pay?
Bart Simpson,Thirty bucks a week.
Homer Simpson,Pfft. I make more than that.
Bart Simpson,"I was lookin' for those. Thanks, doll."
Marge Simpson,
Fat Tony,It's funny because it's true.
Legs,Well obsoived.
Fat Tony,"Chief Wiggum, you honor us with your presence."
Chief Wiggum,Baloney. I'm not gonna rest until one of us is behind bars -- You! You wouldn't happen to know anything about a cigarette truck that got hijacked on route 401?
Fat Tony,What's a truck?
Chief Wiggum,Don't play dumb with me!
Fat Tony,"Relax Chief, you seem tense. You know, the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan."
Chief Wiggum,"Ah... I'm still gonna put you away, you know."
Fat Tony,"Good for you, Chief."
Homer Simpson,... Bart! Have you started smoking?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Don't lie to me boy.
Homer Simpson,"Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought."
Bart Simpson,They're not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn..."
Delivery Man,Uh... Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods.
Bart Simpson,Right in here my man.
Delivery Man,"Hey kid, you look good with that cigarette. Kind of sophisticated."
Homer Simpson,"Son, I'll never doubt you again."
Kent Brockman,The contents of the hijacked truck: some twelve thousand cartons of Laramie 100's.
Marge Simpson,Homer? Homer!
Chief Wiggum,"We have... uh... Please, we have a number of leads. And let me assure all you smokers out there... there is no shortage of cigarettes."
Reporter,How do we know that?
Chief Wiggum,"All right, let me refer that question back to Jack Larson, of Laramie Tobacco Products. Jack?"
Jack Larson,"Thank you Chief. Folks, I'm pleased to announce that a new truckload of Laramies with their smooth good taste and rich tobacco flavor is already heading towards Springfield. And the driver has been instructed to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks."
Kent Brockman,"The police suspect the involvement of reputed mobster William ""Fat Tony"" Williams."
Chief Wiggum,Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city. He is the cancer and I am the... uh... ... what cures cancer?
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, is your boss a crook?"
Bart Simpson,I don't think so. Although it would explain an awful lot.
,
Fat Tony,Me and the boys wish to thank you for hanging onto this stuff for us.
Bart Simpson,"Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?"
Fat Tony,"Bart, um... is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Fat Tony,"Well, suppose you got a large starving family. Is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread to feed them?"
Bart Simpson,Uh-uh.
Fat Tony,"And what if your family don't like bread, they like cigarettes?"
Bart Simpson,I guess that's okay.
Fat Tony,"Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Hell no!
Fat Tony,Enjoy your gift.
Bart Simpson,Supoib.

Bart Simpson,"THOSE FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR / THAT SLY COME HITHER STARE / THAT STRIPS MY CONSCIENCE BARE / IT'S WITCHCRAFT - GIMME THREE FINGERS OF MILK, MA."
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"I know it's good for a boy to have a part-time job, but I'm not sure about the people Bart's working for. I thinks they're criminals."
Fat Tony,The kiss of death. That's all I need!
Homer Simpson,"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
Marge Simpson,"Well, Bart's been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
Marge Simpson,How long does it take to deliver a pizza?
,
Fbi Agent #1,Looks like our cover's blown.
Fbi Agent #2,Let's roll.
,
Homer Simpson,See? It was all your imagination.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
Fat Tony,Beats me.
Joey,I was bluffin'.
Legs,"You win again, Homer."
Homer Simpson,
Fat Tony,I am thrilled you've decided to let your boy continue to work here.
Homer Simpson,"You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter."
Fat Tony,"Homer, you're a hellava father."
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what did you find out?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
,
Bart Simpson,"More ""stink lines"" boys."
Seymour Skinner,What's this? What are you boys doing?
Bart Simpson,You ain't seen nothin'. Now beat it.
,
Rival Gang Leader,"So, Fat Tony. You invite me and my associates to your club with the promise of the finest Manhattans in all of Springfield. Now you say your bartender isn't here?"
Fat Tony,I don't know what happened. He's never late. Louie! Make up some Manhattans.
Louie,But I only know how to make wine spritzers.
Fat Tony,Now!
Rival Gang Leader,"What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless Manhattan?"
Rival Gang Leader,"Come on, boys."
Bart Simpson,Lousy Skinner.
Fat Tony,You are late for work.
Bart Simpson,Of course I'm late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school?
Fat Tony,This guy Skinner causing you trouble?
Bart Simpson,"He sure is, Patrone."
Fat Tony,"Hm... perhaps we should go to meet and greet this individual. Come on, boys."
,
Secretary,"Some large men to see you, sir."
Seymour Skinner,I don't have an appointment with any large men --
Fat Tony,You Skinner?
Seymour Skinner,"I'm PRINCIPAL Skinner, yes. And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors?"
,
Edna Krabappel,"Children, I don't know how to break this to you, but Principal Skinner is... ... MISSING!"
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
,
,
Groundskeeper Willie,I thought I found him but it was only a cat.

Chief Wiggum,"Now please... Please, please, I can assure you we'll be using the most advanced, scientific techniques in the field of... body finding."
Psychic,I see wedding bells for Vanna White and Teddy Kennedy....
Chief Wiggum,"Please, Princess Opal, if we could just stick to Principal Skinner."
Psychic,"Chief Wiggum, I am merely a conduit for the spirits. Willie Nelson will astound his fans by swimming the English Channel."
Chief Wiggum,Really? Willie Nelson?
,
Edna Krabappel,He loved fire drills.
Groundskeeper Willie,"Will ya get a hold of yourself, Lass, for the wee bairns!"
,
Lewis Clark,Hey look at me! I'm Skinner's body!
Bart Simpson,"That is not funny, Lewis."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I heard Skinner's buried under his parking spot."
Richard,I heard he was ground up into hamburger and served to us at lunch.
Nelson Muntz,I heard Bart had Skinner killed by gangsters.
Bart Simpson,That's not true! It's just a rumor! You're engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can't prove anything.
,
Skinner Body,You killed me Bart.
Bart Simpson,
Skinner Body,"You killed me, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,
Skinner Body,"You k-killed me, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,

Bart Simpson,Reverend Lovejoy! You've... you've come to comfort me?

Homer Simpson,Kill my boy! Kill my boy!

,
,
Fat Tony,You're eight hours early for work. I like that.
Bart Simpson,Did you kill my principal?
Fat Tony,Uh... Chinese guy with a mustache?
Bart Simpson,No! My principal!
Legs,"That Skinner guy? Naw, we didn't kill him."
Chief Wiggum,Nobody move! You're all under arrest for the murder of Seymour Skinner.
Fat Tony,What's a murder?
Chief Wiggum,"Don't play dumb with me. Cuff 'em, boys."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart. Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys."
Homer Simpson,"Wait till I get you home, boy."
Bart Simpson,What's that guy doing here?
Lionel Hutz,"Lionel Hutz, court-appointed attorney. I'll be defending you on the charge of -- Murder one?! Wow, even if I lose I'll be famous!"
,
Waylon Smithers,That Simpson boy is looking at a hundred and eighty years.
Fat Tony,"Yeah, you're right."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.
,
Fat Tony,I didn't order this Skinner guy killed.
Blue-Haired Lawyer,But aren't you the head of this gang?
Fat Tony,"No, I just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary newspaper."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,Then who is the Kingpin... the Capo de tuti Capi?
Fat Tony,That's the guy.
Bart Simpson,Hey!
Fat Tony,"Forgive me, Don Bartholomew."
Louie,"We tried to stop the kid, but he wouldn't quit. It was like he went crazy."
Legs,"Prostitution, loan sharking, numbers. The kid liked to wet his beak in everything."
Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit."
Judge Snyder,"In light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters, your father, your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters, this court has no choice but to..."
Seymour Skinner,Stop!
Marge Simpson,Principal Skinner!
Homer Simpson,I thought he was dead.
Seymour Skinner,"I suppose you're all wondering where I've been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when..."
,
Seymour Skinner,I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said.
Louie,We really think there's promise in the boy.
Seymour Skinner,Get out!
Fat Tony,"Okay, okay, you don't have to yell."
,
Seymour Skinner,To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
Homer Simpson,"Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
,
Juvies,
Seymour Skinner,"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
,
Chief Wiggum,"Find anything this time, boys?"
Lou,"Nah... no sign of him, chief."
Chief Wiggum,Princess Opal?
Psychic,I see nothing here but I'm afraid it's splitsville for Delta Burke and Major Dad.
Chief Wiggum,But they seemed so happy.
Seymour Skinner,"I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me."

Seymour Skinner,I'M IN HERE!!!
Chief Wiggum,"Well, let's go."
Eddie,"Okay, Chief."
Seymour Skinner,"Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself."
Seymour Skinner,"I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges."
Seymour Skinner,"The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord."
Seymour Skinner,"I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom."
,
Seymour Skinner,And that's my courageous story.
Prosecuting Attorney,"Your Honor, the prosecution moves that Principal Skinner's testimony be stricken from the record."
Judge Snyder,Denied. Case dismissed.
Lionel Hutz,"Your Honor, do I still get paid?"
,
Fat Tony,Hey Bart! I hope there are no hard feelings.
Bart Simpson,Get bent.
Fat Tony,"I deserved that. Look, I know we let you down, but me and the boys, we still think you've got a big future in racketeering and extortion."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesn't pay."
,
Announcer,"Blood on the Blackboard: The Bart Simpson Story. Starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, Jane Seymour as the woman he loved, and TV's Doogie Howser, Neil Patrick Harris as Bart Simpson."
Joe,"Bart, I'm scared. Let's get outta here."
Neil,Shaddup!
Neil,"Where do you want it, Skinner?"
Neil,Not smart.
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
Homer Simpson,You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
,
Homer Simpson,"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
Bart Simpson,"""To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart."""
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, that's so sweet. May I see the card?"
Lisa Simpson,Hey there ten-year old. I couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
Lisa Simpson,...so how about a nice pair of bongos? Ewww.
,
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, open it open it open it."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, maybe a little later, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom didn't let you have a party doesn't mean you can't get a present."
Sherri Mackleberry,"We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse."
Terri Mackleberry,I liked the balloons.
Sherri Mackleberry,I liked the party hats.
Bart Simpson,What are you girls talkin' about?
Terri Mackleberry,Nothing.
Bart Simpson,Twins. Open your present.
Bart Simpson,"They're official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I'll keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie."
Martin Prince,"Milhouse, I'd like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring."
Bart Simpson,What's he talkin' about?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh... hey, look at that dog. Isn't that somethin'?"
Bart Simpson,"Wow, brown!"
Otto Mann,"Whoa, Springfield Elementary, last stop. Oh, and by the way, I'd like to say thanks, and 'applause, applause' to 'birthday boy' Milhouse for his totally bitchin' party on Saturday."
Otto Mann,"And uh, Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof."
Bart Simpson,You did have a party. You didn't invite me. And I thought we were best friends.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sorry, Bart."
Otto Mann,Bye little dudes. Don't learn anything I wouldn't learn.

C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones."
Waylon Smithers,"T.G.I.M., Sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here's the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who the devil is Hercules?
Waylon Smithers,"He's my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He's kind of tiny, so... you know, it's a joke. Here's a picture of Herkie."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red."
Waylon Smithers,May I ask how you spent your weekend?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time."
Homer Simpson,What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.
Lenny Leonard,Sounds like my kind of flick.
Carl Carlson,And how.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Otto! Welcome!
Otto Mann,"Apu! Hey, got a ba-ad case of the munchies, man. Time for a Heat-lamp Dog."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, Otto. Otto, did you know there's a small child inside your bus?"
Otto Mann,"Ooo, good thing you warned me. I was on my way to Mexico."
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire..."
Calm Woman,Warning. Problem in sector 7-G.
C. Montgomery Burns,"7-G? Good God, who's the safety inspector there?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent?"
Waylon Smithers,"Actually sir, he was hired under ""Project Bootstrap."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you, President Ford."
,
Homer Simpson,Huh? Noise. Bad noise!
Calm Woman,Five minutes before critical mass.
Homer Simpson,"Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it."
Homer Simpson,Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!
Calm Woman,Sector 7-G is now being isolated.
,
Bart Simpson,"My best friend shafted me. I'll never get over this, Otto-man."
Otto Mann,"Aw, sure you will. You know, once my old lady ran off and married my brother. Well, it hurt, but here it is a month later and I'm sleeping on their couch."
,
Mr. Devereaux,"Margarita, I want you."
Margarita,"Mr. Devereaux, I can't work under these conditions."

Announcer,Meltdown crisis: The first couple of minutes.
Singers,K-B-B-L. Talk radio.
Kent Brockman,"Forget the hair, just give me the blush. Oh, we're on."
Kent Brockman,This station has just learned that a serious crisis is in progress at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.
Marge Simpson,Oh my Lord!
Kent Brockman,On the line with us now is plant owner C. Montgomery Burns. Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction."
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever --"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,-- things couldn't be more ship-shape.
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, where's my radiation suit?"
C. Montgomery Burns,How the hell should I know?
,
Kent Brockman,"Uh, Mr. Burns, people are calling this a meltdown."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, please be all right."
,
Homer Simpson,"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."
,
Homer Simpson,Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
,
Calm Woman,Ninety seconds to core meltdown.
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, there may never be another time to say... I love you, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward."
,
Moe Szyslak,Looks like this is the end.
Barney Gumble,That's all right. I couldn't have led a richer life.
,
Kent Brockman,After the meltdown we can expect roving bands of thieves to tie up traffic for ours.
Grampa Simpson,I don't like this program.
Jasper Beardly,Change the channel.
Program Voices,Wheel of Fortune!
,
Homer Simpson,"I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive I'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix."
,
Calm Woman,One minute to core meltdown.
Homer Simpson,Shut up!
Homer Simpson,"Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, think back to your training..."
,
Instructor,"Now Homer, this may very well save your life one day. This, Homer..."
Homer Simpson,Yes.
Instructor,"Please pay attention. This button here controls the emergency override circuit. In the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a side."
Instructor,Simpson?
Homer Simpson,What?
Instructor,Do you see which button I'm pushing?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it."
Homer Simpson,"This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!"
,
Calm Woman,Thirty seconds to core meltdown.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye!"
Waylon Smithers,"May I, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Professor Jonathan Frink,"These unfortunate people here will be instantly killed. This circle, which I am sad to say we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death."
Kent Brockman,Good Lord.
,
Seymour Skinner,They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who's laughing now?
,
Calm Woman,Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
Homer Simpson,"Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe."
Calm Woman,All systems returning to normal. Danger in 7-G neutralized. Have a nice day.
,
Female Worker,Will I ever see you again?
Male Worker,"Sure, baby. Next meltdown."
,
Contestant,"I'd like to solve the puzzle: ""Three loins in the fountain."""
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, we've isolated the problem and wouldn't you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system."
Kent Brockman,"Very good. Well sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well taken. This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant in the future."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Well, ""ta"". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell 'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don't be stingy with the vino."
Waylon Smithers,Yes sir.
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, Smithers, it seems you've underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month."
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, a little salt?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Sure.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, my mom won't let me be your friend anymore. That's why you couldn't come to the party."
Bart Simpson,What's she got against me?
Milhouse Van Houten,She says you're a bad influence.
Bart Simpson,"Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"But Bart, she threatened to cut off my allowance."
Bart Simpson,"Whatever she's paying you, I'll double it."
Milhouse Van Houten,"I'm really sorry, Bart."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, about Employee-of-the-Month... I-I-if you'll recall, I'm the one who put a five percent ceiling on the Keogh Plan, which saved this company --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson's my man!"
Carl Carlson,"Hey, way to save our lives."
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, we owe you one."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button."
C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, now. That will do. Homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson."
Homer Simpson,Magic Johnson! Y'ello.
Magic Johnson,Is this really Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Magic Johnson,"Wow. Homer, I just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust."
Homer Simpson,"Well, thank you."
Doctor,"Magic, if you play on that ankle, you'll be in incredible pain."
Magic Johnson,I don't care.
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
Magic Johnson,Don't worry. Sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are.
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Magic."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you're not laughing. Too subtle?"
Luann Van Houten,"I'll think about it, Marge."
Bart Simpson,Nah. I'm just depressed. Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him any more.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what's all this?"
Marge Simpson,"""For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!"" Ohh, Homer!"
Lisa Simpson,A role model in my very own home. How convenient.
Homer Simpson,"Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home."
Marge Simpson,"How are you enjoying your ham, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
Lisa Simpson,Maybe you ate a clove.
Homer Simpson,"What's your problem, boy?"
Bart Simpson,I had a fight with Milhouse.
Homer Simpson,That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.
Lisa Simpson,How Zen.
Homer Simpson,What? What is it? What are you doing?
Lisa Simpson,Looking at you with quiet awe.
Homer Simpson,"Well, as long as it's quiet."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Milhouse to Bart, Milhouse to Bart... Please don't hate me. Please?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility."
Homer Simpson,Huh? Wha?...
C. Montgomery Burns,It seems Ari's been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville.
Aristotle,They've lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!
Homer Simpson,Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
Aristotle,Yeah.
C. Montgomery Burns,We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons.
Homer Simpson,"But I really can't tell them anything, sir."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh cut the false modesty, it's getting tiresome. Besides, it's your duty. Employee of the Month isn't all ham and plaques."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit."
Waylon Smithers,"Couldn't help it, sir. The parking here is terrible."
Aristotle,This man has no love for his power plant.
C. Montgomery Burns,Begone from my sight.
C. Montgomery Burns,That one's always been a problem.
,
Bart Simpson,One... two... three... Community chest.
Bart Simpson,Nah.
Bart Simpson,Nah.
Bart Simpson,Ah. I've won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks.
Bart Simpson,Ha ha! You're losing.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, don't feed your sister hotels!"
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry mom, there's tons of these things."
Marge Simpson,I think that game is too old for her. Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
Bart Simpson,I don't wanna play with Milhouse.
Marge Simpson,You mean you still haven't made up with him?
Bart Simpson,"It's his mom. She says I'm a bad influence. C'mon Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that hornet's nest."
,
Marge Simpson,"Mrs. Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
Luann Van Houten,"I remember. Please, come in."
,
Luann Van Houten,"Marge, I'm sorry, but I think it would be better if Milhouse didn't see your son."
Marge Simpson,"Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
Luann Van Houten,"Well, Marge, the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don't say that word on TV!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends!"
Barney Gumble,"So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!"
Lisa Simpson,"I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
Barney Gumble,"Oh, that's sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too."
Moe Szyslak,"Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk."
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk."
Moe Szyslak,Oh.
Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time."
Lisa Simpson,"He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on ""How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."""
Homer Simpson,What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Barney Gumble,"Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody."
Homer Simpson,Did it work?
Barney Gumble,"I'm a free man, ain't I?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Milhouse to Bart, do you want to come over and play?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, I don't think so."
Bart Simpson,"Who cares?! Milhouse, I'll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game's over."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mom, I'm friends with Milhouse again."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I knew his mother would come to her senses.."
,
Marge Simpson,What makes you think I did it?
Bart Simpson,Who else would?
Marge Simpson,You be good.
Bart Simpson,I will.
,
Aristotle,"As I look out into this sea of smiling faces, I am filled with a sense of loathing and revulsion. You are not workers, you are a pack of mangy cud-chewing ugly goats! Well, you're in for a treat. We have with us today a real man. Behold the glory that is Homer Simpson!"
Patient,Poor guy.
Homer Simpson,Uh... ladies and... gentlemen...
Thought Bubble Barney,Just picture them in their underwear.
Homer Simpson,"Um, Grace under pressure is no..."
Female Voice,Three minutes to meltdown.
Homer Simpson,Whew! Saved by the bell.
Female Voice,Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
Aristotle,Just do what you did before.
Homer Simpson,All right.
,
Homer Simpson,"Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe."
Female Voice,Crisis has been averted. Everything is super.
Aristotle,Thank you Homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. Do you even know what button you pushed?
Homer Simpson,Sure. Moe.
Kent Brockman,Eenie meenie minee moe / Is Homer a hero? / The answer is... no. I'm Kent Brockman and that was... My Two Cents. Now back to Scott Christian with Laugh and a Half.
SCOTT,"Thanks, Kent. There was more dumb luck in the news today when our own Police Chief Wiggum foiled a bank hold-up without even trying. It seems the chief had come to the bank to cash in his penny jar."
Chief Wiggum,"...48, 49, 50."
Security Guard,"Good work, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,Just doing my job.
SCOTT,"Yes, it seems the chief pulled a Homer Simpson of his own."
,
Barney Gumble,Whoa!
Barney Gumble,"Huh? A pretzel? Wow, looks like I pulled a Homer!"
,
Announcer,"The Lakers have the ball. Magic Johnson's coming down the floor on a fast break. Magic stops. His feet slip out from under him. The ball flies out of his hand, hits the referee in the head, goes in the basket! It's a three point play. The Lakers win!"
Magic Johnson,Looks like I pulled a Homer.
,
Lisa Simpson,Our dad... now he belongs to the ages.
,
,
Krusty the Clown,I hold in my hand the final axe.
Krusty the Clown,"Well, kids, that's all the time we have for today."
Krusty the Clown,"I'd like to thank Sideshow Mel, Corporal Punishment, Tina Ballerina, oh, and from ""Knots Landing"" Miss Donna Mills. Oh, she was a sport."
Krusty the Clown,WE'VE HAD LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN/ BUT NOW THE TIME HAS COME... TO GO/ IF THIS OLD CLOWN WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED TOMORROW/ I'D BE IN HEAVEN STILL DOING THIS SHOW.
Krusty the Clown,See you some other time!
,
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Great show, Krusty! I really laughed when you..."
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's my nicotine gum?"
Krusty the Clown,"Ahh... that's the stuff. Damn, I'm exhausted. Those kids were like ice out there."

Krusty the Clown,Cancel it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Therapist?
Krusty the Clown,Cancel it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Personal trainer?
Krusty the Clown,Cancel it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,The opening line on the Giants is five and a half.
Krusty the Clown,Put a dime on it.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Thank you dinner with Bart Simpson?
Krusty the Clown,I don't know any Bart Simpson.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Krusty, he's the boy who saved you from jail."
Chief Wiggum,"Well, we... made a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh... won't happen again."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Yes, sir?"
Krusty the Clown,Thank you.
,
Krusty the Clown,Oh yeah. Cancel it.
,
Marge Simpson,Hello?
,
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Mrs. Simpson, this is Lois Pennycandy, Krusty the Clown's executive assistant."
Marge Simpson,"Oh hello, Mrs. Pennycandy."
Miss Lois Pennycandy,Read this.
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"It's Miss Pennycandy, I can assure you. I'm sorry to inform you that Krusty will once again not be joining Bart for dinner."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, dear. This is the fifth time he's cancelled. How can he hurt someone who loves him so?"
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Oh, Mrs. Simpson, I've wasted my womanhood asking that same question. I apologize for him, something really important came up at the last minute."
,
Krusty the Clown,"Lousy mildew. Eh, that's good enough."
,
Marge Simpson,"Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye."
Bart Simpson,"Okay Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you down for?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,A hundred.
Bart Simpson,Consider it done.
Bart Simpson,YOU'RE WALKING ALONG THE STREET/ OR YOU'RE AT A PARTY/ OR ELSE YOU'RE ALONE/ AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY DIG... DIG... DIG.
,
Bart Simpson,THIS COULD BE THE START OF SOMETHING BIG...
Marge Simpson,"Sweetie, I'm sorry, but Krusty isn't coming to dinner again."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, man."
Bart Simpson,"Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302 respectfully returning his Badge..."
,
Bart Simpson,"...I always suspected that nothing in life mattered. Now I know for sure. Get bent, Bart Simpson."
,
Krusty the Clown,Ooh. Sex chat!
Sexy Female Recording,"You have reached the party line! In a moment you'll be connected to a hot party with some of the world's most beautiful women. Now, let's join the party!"
Krusty the Clown,Hello?
Larry,Hello?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Are, are there any women here?"
Krusty the Clown,Hello?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Are you a beautiful woman?
Krusty the Clown,Do I sound like a beautiful woman?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,This is not the sort of party as I had anticipated.
Kids,
Krusty the Clown,"Uh...ehhh... deeee... eeee... deeaar... Dear... Krust...""y""...?"
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"It says that the little boy who never lost faith in you has lost faith in you. Krusty, you are going to Bart Simpson's house for dinner tonight."
Krusty the Clown,But I have plans.
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, not the face."
PENNYCANDY,"Why you, maddening, impossible man. If you don't go tonight, I won't be here tomorrow."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, alright. I'll go."
Krusty the Clown,But I sure hate missing Schnapps Night at the Friars Club.
,
Marge Simpson,"Bart, wipe your feet."
Bart Simpson,"Why bother, they'll just get dirty again."
Marge Simpson,I've got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight.
Bart Simpson,"He is, for sure?"
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Bart Simpson,God bless that clown.
Homer Simpson,You think it's him?
Krusty the Clown,"Hi, kids! Hey, hey!"
Krusty the Clown,"Heh, heh, cute kid."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, hi Bart. I was just in the neighborhood. Why Krusty the Clown! What a surprise."
Bart Simpson,Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade.
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, you don't have to be ""on"" tonight."
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about? Of course he does.
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad, Krusty is our guest. Your pratfalls and Punchinello antics aren't necessary here."
Krusty the Clown,Really?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, just relax and be yourself."
Krusty the Clown,"Ohh, that's a relief."
Krusty the Clown,Go wait in the car.
Homer Simpson,We could have seen a monkey.
Marge Simpson,Who wants to say grace?
Lisa Simpson,Why don't we let our guest do it?
Milhouse Van Houten,Bless us O lord...
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey!
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, would you do the honors?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,No! A clown is not a respected member of the community.
,
Krusty the Clown,"Well, alright. I'm a little rusty, but um, I'll try. Baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz."
Homer Simpson,He's talking funny talk.
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad, that's Hebrew. Krusty must be Jewish."
Homer Simpson,A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, There are many prominent Jewish entertainers including Lauren Bacall, Dinah Shore, William Shatner, and Mel Brooks."
Homer Simpson,Mel Brooks is Jewish?
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, are you alright?"
Krusty the Clown,"Yes, it's just that saying the brucha brings back a lot of painful memories. The old days... my... my father..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?"
Lisa Simpson,"Poor Krusty, he's like a black velvet painting come to life."
Marge Simpson,"Krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? You'll feel better."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, spill your guts, man."
Lisa Simpson,Come on...
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Krusty, tell us."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, okay. First of all, my real name isn't Krusty the Clown, it's Hershel Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father's father -- well, you get the idea."
,
Krusty the Clown,My father was the most respected man in the lower east side of Springfield. People would come from miles around to ask his advice.
Man #1,"Reb Krustofsky, should I finish college?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Yes. No one is poor except he who lacks knowledge.
Woman,"Rabbi, should I have another child?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Yes, another child would be a blessing on your house."
Man #2,"Rabbi, should I buy a Chrysler?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Could you rephrase that as a, as a ethical question?"
Man #2,Hmm... is it right to buy a Chrysler?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Yes, for great is the car with power steering and dyna-flow suspension."
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Hershel, life is not fun. Life is serious. Seltzer is for drinking, not for spraying. Pie is for noshing, not for throwing."
Krusty the Clown,"But papa, can't..."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,But nothing! You'll do as I say or you'll get such a zetz that you won't even know what hit you.
,
Krusty the Clown,"Dad wanted me to follow in his footsteps, but the pull of clowning was too strong. I got my first big laughs at Yeshiva impersonating my father."
,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps."
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, I don't even like using the bathroom after you."
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Lisa Simpson,"Krusty, please continue."
Krusty the Clown,Okay.
,
Krusty the Clown,My father tried to extinguish the comedy bug. But it was no use.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,What are you doing in that bathroom?
Krusty the Clown,Go away.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Open the door this instant.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Oy gevalt!
Krusty the Clown,Close the door!
,
Krusty the Clown,Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills and I was the entertainment.
Krusty the Clown,But the Lord works in mysterious ways.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Do you know that my son Hershel was first in his Yeshiva class. As a matter of fact, he was voted ""The Most Likely to Hear God."""
Rabbi #1,"Oh go on, Hymie. You're exaggerating again. You're so proud of your son."
,
Krusty the Clown,"My father would have never have suspected a thing, were it not for one rowdy rabbi."
Rowdy Rabbi,"Hey, Funny-man!"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Hershel? Hershel! Oy vay iz mir!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,I have no son!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"You have brought shame on our family. Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive. But, but-but this? I never want to see you again. You... you... clown!"
,
Krusty the Clown,And I haven't seen my father since.
Lisa Simpson,That is so sad.
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?"
Krusty the Clown,All the time. Except when I'm at the track. Then it's all business.
Krusty the Clown,"Look at you, Bart."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, isn't that fun?"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, whoa."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, the Fourth of July. I can't believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I've got a lot of fond memories."
Marge Simpson,"Well, look at the time. Almost midnight."
Krusty the Clown,Do you have any yearbooks?
Homer Simpson,"No, that's it. You've seen everything."
Krusty the Clown,"So uh, Milhouse, know any knock-knock jokes?"
Milhouse Van Houten,I want to go home.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home."
Homer Simpson,Gladly.
Krusty the Clown,Wow. The Concert For Bangladesh.
Bart Simpson,"Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad."
Krusty the Clown,"Don't worry about me, I'm a survivor."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, did I leave my keys inside?"
Bart Simpson,No!
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, yeah. Here they are."
,
,
Announcer,"Academy Award Playhouse now returns you to ""Hercules vs. The Martians."""
Martian,"Welcome to our spaceship, mighty Hercules."
,
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Hello? Hello? Anybody there?
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh great, we came all this way and it's the wrong guy."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,I didn't mean that literally.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"What's this? I hear a phone ring and all of a sudden there's nothing. I'm listening and there's no talking. Hello. Mister, who are you? Why would they call ya if they don't want to talk to ya."
,
,
Krusty the Clown,"Didn't Itchy Jr. look happy playing with his father? And didn't Scratchy Jr. look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher? Wasn't that a beautiful cartoon? For the love of God, cut to a commercial."
Bart Simpson,Poor Krusty.
Lisa Simpson,A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
Bart Simpson,We've got to do something.
Lisa Simpson,Let's move.
,
Bart Simpson,"Reverend Lovejoy, we need you to help us find a rabbi."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, um... before you make any rash decisions, let me just remind you that the church is changing to meet the needs of today's young Christians."
Lisa Simpson,"No, no. We're not converting, we just want to find a Rabbi Krustofsky."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Rabbi Krustofsky? Why, I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night."
Bart Simpson,Really?
Lisa Simpson,I didn't know that.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Gee, I mention it in my sermon every week."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, oh, that radio show."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on Monday at school."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, well. Why have a free T-shirt. You'll be the ""coolest"" kids on the playground."
Bart Simpson,We'll put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbi's address?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh sure thing. Let me just check my ""Non-Christian"" rolodex."
,
Lisa Simpson,I bet the rabbi misses Krusty.
Bart Simpson,"He'll be so happy, he'll be crying in his beard."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, what can I do for you, my young friends?"
Bart Simpson,We came to talk to you about your son.
D.J.,"And in order to keep our broadcasting license, we devote Sunday night dead time to public service shows of limited appeal."
D.J.,"In that spirit, we bring you ""Gabbin' about God,"" sponsored by Ace Religion Supply where they say: ""If we don't got it, it ain't holy."""
D.J.,"With us tonight, once again, our very own three wise men: Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Monsignor Kenneth Daley, and Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky."
D.J.,"Okay, and our first caller is from Shelbyville Heights."
Caller,"Yes, hi, with all the suffering and injustice in the world, do you ever wonder if God really exists?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,No.
MONSIGNOR DALEY,Not for a second.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Not at all.
D.J.,Great. Good conversation there. Our next call now is for the good Rabbi.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Hello? Anybody there? I hear breathing but I don't hear talking. What's going on here? Hello, mister. Hello... hello."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Some people got nothing to do but call people and hang up. There's all kinds of meshugoyim in the world.
,
,
D.J.,"Okay, let's clear the board. Our next caller is a young boy from right here in Springfield."
Bart Simpson,"Hello, my name's Dimitri. I'm a first time caller, long time listener."
,
Bart Simpson,"My question is, ""If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the father forgive the son?"""
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I think so.
MONSIGNOR DALEY,"Yes, of course."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,No way. Absolutely not. Never! Never! Who screens these calls? Who's in charge here? There's nobody in charge. They leave a building without people watching it and anybody who wants can call any stupid person they please...
,
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Lis. I've got a plan that can't fail."
,
Bart Simpson,"Yiddle my man, you're a genius."
Yiddle,I love my work.
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, the best charity is to give and not let other people know."
Rabbi #2,But what if your example encourages others to give?
Bart Simpson,"Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, don't you think it's time you forgave your son?"
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Don't you understand that my boy broke my heart? He turned his back on our traditions and our faith, and on me. Get out of here you little pisher!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Oy, this guy's tough."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
Bart Simpson,"I don't know, he's pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise."
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"What? Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist. He wants to have lunch with me? Ah ah, It's a date! Izzy's Deli, one o'clock, I'll be there."
,
Krusty the Clown,"The French government wants to give me The Legion of Honor? Where do I receive this prestigious award? Izzy's Deli, one o'clock. Thank you, Monsieur President."
,
Bart Simpson,Au revoir.
,
Waitress,Are you kids ready to order yet?
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, no. Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles."
Waitress,Watch how fast I go.
Waitress,And for you sir?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, let's see. I want a nice sandwich, but the Joey Bishop, ugh, too fatty... the Jackie Mason, I don't know, sauerkraut makes me gassy. The Bruce Willis, I don't even like his work... What is this?... Krusty the Clown!?"
Waitress,"That's ham, sausage and bacon with a smidge of mayo..."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,What?
Waitress,... on white bread.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Listen, you tell Mr. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning Jewish novelist, that I lost my appetite."
Krusty the Clown,"Uh, could you direct me to President Francois Mitterrand's table?"
Waitress,You think you're funny?
Krusty the Clown,Fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong.
Bart Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we've been going about this all wrong. What's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
Bart Simpson,Those stupid hats?
Lisa Simpson,No Bart. Knowledge.
,
Lisa Simpson,We're gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica.
Bart Simpson,"Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!!"
Lisa Simpson,This looks good Bart. Take it to him.
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,You I told to go away.
Bart Simpson,"But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, ""A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."""
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Yes.
Bart Simpson,Then doesn't your religion command you to make up with Krusty?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"But in Exodus, the fifth commandment says, ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother."" End of story."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, it's hopeless."
Lisa Simpson,Not quite. I got some dynamite stuff from Rabbi Simon ben Eleazar.
,
Bart Simpson,At all times let a man be supple as a reed and not rigid as a cedar.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"But, my short learned friend, the Book of Joshua says, ""You shall meditate on the Torah all day and all night."""
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Is it not written in the Talmud, ""Who will bring redemption? The jesters."""
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Sorry my friend, I'm still not convinced. And this is hardly the time or place to discuss it."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Here you go, Bart. It's a long shot, but, that's all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew."
Lisa Simpson,Bart! I am not gonna learn ancient Hebrew.
,
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,No one could be / so gentle and so LOVEABLE / Oh mein papa / he always understood.
Moe Szyslak,I got somethin' in my eye.
Barney Gumble,"Here, take my hanky."
Moe Szyslak,Eeww!
Bart Simpson,"Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, ""The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, I've heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it."" End quote."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Ohh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that, Rabbi Hillel?"
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,It was Judah the Pious?
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Mamonides?
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, I got it -- the Dead Sea Scrolls."
Bart Simpson,"I'm afraid not, Rabbi. It's from ""Yes, I Can"" by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,The candy man?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"If a performer can think that way, maybe I'm completely upside-down on this whole problem. All the years of joy that I've lost. Why? Because of my stubborn ways."
Lisa Simpson,"There, there, Rabbi. It's not too late."
,
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, kids... Today's show is gonna be the funniest, sidesplitin'est, cavalcade of... ah the hell with it. Roll the cartoon."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, yeah. My old friends, right next to my heart."
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oy, such a filthy habit."
Krusty the Clown,Who asked you? Father?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Son!
Krusty the Clown,Papa!
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Hershel.
Krusty the Clown,Daddy.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,Boychik!
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, Daddy..."
Stagehand,"You're on, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,"Boys and girls, I'd like to be serious for a moment if I may. Spotlight, please."
Krusty the Clown,I just wanted... I just wanted... Come on guys. I'm not doing the spotlight bit.
Krusty the Clown,"Let's have a warm Krusty welcome for my estranged father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky."
Krusty the Clown,"Lenny, a little reconciliation music if you please... Oh mein papa / to me he was so wonderful / Oh mein papa/ Come on, Dad / to me he was so good/ You know the words."
Krusty the Clown,We haven't seen each other in twenty-five years.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky,"Oh, I love you, son."
Krusty the Clown,"I love you too, Daddy."

Bart Simpson,Heh heh heh...Jackpot!
Homer Simpson,"I am very, very proud of you kids."
Bart Simpson,We would have gotten even more if Lisa could walk faster.
Lisa Simpson,I didn't select this costume for mobility. I wore it to salute the noble native American of the Pacific Northwests...
Lisa Simpson,YAHHH!
Marge Simpson,"Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for..."
Marge Simpson,If you eat too much you'll have nightmares.

Lisa Simpson,"Oh yeah, three bad nightmares."
Homer Simpson,I'd like to see that.

Homer Simpson,What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's Monaco."
Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,I can do that but I don't wanna.
Homer Simpson,Eeuhgh. What is this thing?
Merchant,"It is a monkey's paw, dating back to Allal ben Abdallah. It has the power to grant wishes to its owner."
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? How much?
Marge Simpson,Look everybody! My purse exploded!
Merchant,"Sir, I must strongly advise you do not purchase this. Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. I myself was once President of Algeria..."
Homer Simpson,"C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!"

Marge Simpson,"Ugghh, Homer. Where did you get that ugly thing?"
Homer Simpson,"Why at that little shop, right over... there."
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, wait, it was over there."

Otto Mann,"Man, this thing's really gettin' outta hand."

Helen Lovejoy,"Oh, is there anything they won't do?"

Marge Simpson,"Oh Homer, this is awful."

Homer Simpson,"Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey's a little dry. The turkey's a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?!"

Dr. Marvin Monroe,"You like attention, don't you Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Do I ever!
DR MONROE,"Well we all do. The problem is that you don't care whether you get good attention, for say getting good marks in school, or bad attention for .. say.. turning your father into a Jack-in-the-box."
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"Homer, I see you agree with my theory."
Homer Simpson,I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning.
Dr. Marvin Monroe,Well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. I want you to spend some quality time with him. Get to know him. Maybe even love him.
Homer Simpson,Ouch!

C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, to the laboratory."

,
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know Smithers, I've always despised the laziness of the common worker. Then I realized his spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak.

C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, who is a model ... employee?"
Waylon Smithers,"Ehhh... Simpson will do just fine, sir."
Waylon Smithers,"Did you hear that, sir?"

C. Montgomery Burns,Oh... bad corpse. Bad corpse. Stop scaring Smithers. Satisfied?
Waylon Smithers,"Thank you, sir."

,
C. Montgomery Burns,"It wasn't suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Smithers, I was wrong to play god. Life is precious, not a thing to be toyed with. Now, take out that brain and flush it down the toilet."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, his family might appreciate it if you returned the brain to his body."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, come on. It's 11:45."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh you're right, Smithers. I guess I owe you a coke."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And as for you, you clinking, clattering, cacophony of colligenous cogs and camshafts, take that."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahhh!
Waylon Smithers,"Run, sir!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Every bone... shattered... organs... leaking vital fluids. Slight headache... loss of appetite. Smithers, I'm going to die."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, is there nothing I can do?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, perhaps. Smithers go to my office. In the third drawer of my desk are surgical tools and some ether..."
,
Marge Simpson,"Did you have a nightmare, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,No. Bart bit me.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab."
Homer Simpson,I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
Homer Simpson,I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh that's right. It's all a dream.
C. Montgomery Burns,Or is it?
TV Announcer,Next week on The Simpsons.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner."
Homer Simpson,Umm. Spaghetti.
C. Montgomery Burns,"But Homer, tonight's our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hate having two heads."
Homer-Ape,Oooh.
Homer-Ape,Ahhh.
,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm calling about the school talent show."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I know it's tonight."
Little Man,Alto or tenor?
Lisa Simpson,"No. Dad, I broke my last saxophone reed, and I need you to get me a new one."
Homer Simpson,Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
Lisa Simpson,"I called her. She's not home. I also tried Mr. Flanders, Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Dr. Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement."
Homer Simpson,"Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Well, you're in for a whale of a show tonight. I'd like to point out that the doors are now locked, so you parents can't sneak out of the show after your own child has performed. Oh, and let me caution the people in the first five rows, you will get wet."
,
Homer Simpson,"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes."
Moe Szyslak,Why don't you go there first?
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?"
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer."
,
Lunchlady Doris,This is a whole lotta nothin'.
Groundskeeper Willie,I'd rather be watching the boilers!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I'm not kidding."
,
Homer Simpson,Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.
Little Man,"What's the matter, buddy?"
Homer Simpson,The moron next door closed early!
Little Man,I happen to be that moron.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, me and my trenchant mouth."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Terrible, just terrible. You know, they seem to get worse every year."
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it!"
Seymour Skinner,"Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch we've ever had. I really do. And now, here's Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices."
Bart Simpson,I'd like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner.
Bart Simpson,"Duh, look at me, I'm Principal Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,That young man just became the Boy of a Thousand Days Detention.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, it's Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what she's got for us today. Today's special is refried dog poop."
Bleeding Gums Murphy,
,
Homer Simpson,"Please, you've got to open that store."
Little Man,Let me think about it... Eh... No.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one."
Moe Szyslak,"Come on, Jer. Open up. Be a pal. Remember when I pulled you and your wife out of that burning car?"
Little Man,Okay. Okay. But now we're even. So what does your daughter need?
Homer Simpson,"I'll have you know, I wrote it down."
Homer Simpson,Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
Homer Simpson,Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!
Little Man,Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play?
Homer Simpson,I dunno.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, where is he? If I don't get that reed I'll sound terrible."
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, honey, I'm sure your father is..."
Marge Simpson,Maybe.
Marge Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,That's a long shot.
Marge Simpson,Bingo.
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, he'll be here."
,
Little Man,Clarinet?
Homer Simpson,No.
Little Man,Oboe?
Homer Simpson,No.
Little Man,Saxophone?
Homer Simpson,No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?
Little Man,Saxophone?
,
Chuck,My ding-a-ling / My ding-a-ling / I want you to play with my ding-a-ling --
Seymour Skinner,"This act is over! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to put this filth behind us, and let's all enjoy Lisa Simpson's rendition of ""Stormy Leather -- ah, Weather."""
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw.
Groundskeeper Willie,Sounds like that gopher I caught in me lawnmower.
,
Homer Simpson,"Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father."
,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.
Seymour Skinner,That'll do.
Lisa Simpson,It's not my fault. It's the reed.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh yes, of course. It's the reed."
Seymour Skinner,Let's hear it for Lisa Simpson and her wacky sax.
Homer Simpson,Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!
,
,
Teenager,"Okay, who ordered the Mount Bellyache?"
Homer Simpson,I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
Lisa Simpson,I'm done.
Homer Simpson,That cost eighty-eight dollars!
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry dad, I don't feel much like eating."
Homer Simpson,"Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
Lisa Simpson,I forgive you.
Homer Simpson,You didn't mean that!
Lisa Simpson,No. I didn't.
,
Marge Simpson,"Look Homer, Lisa's taking her first steps."
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Baby Lisa,Da-da. Da-da.
Marge Simpson,"Did you hear that, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, if you want to make up with Lisa just spend some time with her."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. If you keep spending time with Lisa, she'll forgive you."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for."
Marge Simpson,We can't afford to buy a pony.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony."
Marge Simpson,That's ridiculous.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore."
Marge Simpson,That's no reason to buy a pony!
Homer Simpson,"See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes."
Marge Simpson,Stick to the subject.
Homer Simpson,"Ha ha, you love me."
Marge Simpson,Let's be realistic. A pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Marge Simpson,You sound like you're going to buy a pony. Promise me you won't.
Homer Simpson,Mm.
Marge Simpson,What was that? Was that a yes or a no?
Homer Simpson,Buh.
Marge Simpson,Those aren't even words!
Homer Simpson,Sneh.
,
,
Salesclerk,"Oh my, what is that smell?"
Salesclerk,"Oh, it's you."
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, do you sell ponies?"
Salesclerk,"Uh, sure pal, right here."
Homer Simpson,"""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog!"
Salesclerk,"My friend, you're smarter than I gave you credit for. I suggest you try the pony farm on Route 401. Merely take a left at the rendering plant."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs."
Millicent,Very good. That stunning creature over there is half a million dollars.
Homer Simpson,Half a million dollars?!
Millicent,He was sired by Seattle Slew and his mother won the Kentucky Derby.
Homer Simpson,Wow!
Millicent,His likeness graces a stamp in Tanzania...
Homer Simpson,I'll take it!
Millicent,"Mr. Simpson, do you have half a million dollars?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, sure... let me write you a check."
Millicent,"Mr. Simpson, this check is dated January 1, 2054."
Homer Simpson,Is there a problem with that?
Millicent,Our ponies start at five thousand dollars. Cash.
Homer Simpson,Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
Millicent,I sincerely hope not.
,
,
Homer Simpson,I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
Female Clerk,"Sorry, I can't approve a loan that size myself."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hel-lo.
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? How can I help you?"
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you do this personally?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a hobby. I'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. By the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws?"
Homer Simpson,U-su-ry?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Silly me, I must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. Now, what is the purpose of this loan?"
Homer Simpson,I want to buy a pony.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Isn't that cute? Smithers, he's planning on joining the horsey set. That is it, isn't it? You're not planning to eat it?"
Homer Simpson,No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
Waylon Smithers,"Shut up, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Waylon Smithers,Do you have any collateral?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh Smithers, let's not be so cold. His spirit is my collateral. Just sign this form and the money will be yours."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sorry, I was just, uh, thinking of something funny Smithers did today."
Waylon Smithers,"I didn't do anything funny, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Shut up.
,
Millicent,"Mr. Simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony?"
Homer Simpson,Of course.
,
Homer Simpson,"Simpson, you've done it again."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I love you, Dad!"
Marge Simpson,I am very upset with you.
Homer Simpson,Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?"
Homer Simpson,Because she stopped loving me.
Bart Simpson,I don't love you either. So give me a moped.
Homer Simpson,I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.
Lisa Simpson,Snowball II... Santa's Little Helper... this is Princess. Please don't exclude her because she's different.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
Homer Simpson,I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, no!"
Marge Simpson,That's illegal.
Homer Simpson,"That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I think Princess belongs in a stable."
Homer Simpson,Stable? That sounds expensive.
Homer Simpson,This is what love costs a month?
Millicent,"These are standard stable fees, Mr. Simpson. Plus, I'm teaching your daughter riding, grooming, and at no extra charge, pronunciation."
Lisa Simpson,"Father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived."
Homer Simpson,Oh nuts.
Grampa Simpson,What do I do? What do I do?
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, if you wanna go right..."
Grampa Simpson,Yes...
Bart Simpson,... move your joystick to the left.
Grampa Simpson,"Yes, move the... what's a joystick? You didn't tell me..."
Bart Simpson,"Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it!"
Grampa Simpson,Wait. Where's the Hyperspace?
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, you're the spaceship, not the..."
Grampa Simpson,I'm the what? I thought I was this guy. Ohhh.
Bart Simpson,"Game's over, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,I got down on the floor for this?
Lisa Simpson,"Wait, Dad, I've got something for you."
Homer Simpson,I was hoping it'd be money.
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. We're just going to have to cut down on luxuries."
Homer Simpson,"Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
Marge Simpson,"Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer."
Homer Simpson,"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
Marge Simpson,Then I'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
Homer Simpson,"First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind."
Marge Simpson,Homer...
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays."
Marge Simpson,"All right. You got us into this, you get us out."
Homer Simpson,"Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it."
Homer Simpson,Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
,
Lisa Simpson,You're so beautiful.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh look. You haven't touched your salt lick. Num num, good salt lick."
,
Homer Simpson,Need money. Need money.
Homer Simpson,"One Scratch-for-Cash, please."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Here you go.
Homer Simpson,"Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh congratulations, Mr. Homer!"
Homer Simpson,Thank you.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,If I could just see the ticket...
Homer Simpson,There it is.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Please to be removing your thumb.
Homer Simpson,No.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes. Please, I must insist..."
Homer Simpson,No! No!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I've got to look at the ticket
Homer Simpson,No! You can't see... come on!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, I must..."
Homer Simpson,No!
Homer Simpson,Let go. You're ripping it.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"A cherry! Oh, Mr. Homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery?"
Homer Simpson,Ohh... I need money.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my ""Help Wanted"" sign."
Homer Simpson,You're looking for help?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes. We need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift."
Homer Simpson,I'm your man!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,You're hired.
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Always I dreamed the day would come when one of you would be working for me!
,
Kevin,She certainly tamed that horse.
Ralph Wiggum,"Yes, but what man can tame her?"
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I won't lie to you. On this job you will be shot at.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor.
Homer Simpson,...Badge of honor.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Here's a pointer: try to take it in the shoulder.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There's only one bozo who comes in and buys them."
Homer Simpson,But I eat... Oh.
,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh, the perfect crime."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, where have you been? I was so worried."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it."
Bart Simpson,Busted!
,
Homer Simpson,"I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
Bart Simpson,"Oh my God, she killed him."
Homer Simpson,Mmm... salty.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Homer, are you stealing Squishees?"
Homer Simpson,No sir.
Lisa Simpson,"This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It's called ""Wildfire."""
Princess Kashmir,"Come on, Apu honey, loosen up."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I'm sorry, baby. While I am here pleasuring you, my store is going down the tubes."
Princess Kashmir,
Ned Flanders,Three dollars and fifty-one... fifty-two... fifty-three cents.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Homer! You are asleep at your post! Now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.
Homer Simpson,Yes sir.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Sorry baby, date's over."
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, how long do you plan to do this?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know. How long do horses live?
Marge Simpson,Thirty years?
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
Lisa Simpson,"I just called to say I love you, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?
Johnny Carson,I just heard Millie Vanillie was just arrested for impersonating a McNugget.
Johnny Carson,"Well, it's true."
Bart Simpson,"Well, it's still fun to be up late."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Homer, where ya goin'?"
Homer Simpson,Going for... eight hour walk.
,
Homer Simpson,Homer sleep now.
Lisa Simpson,What's wrong with Dad?
Marge Simpson,"He's just exhausted. Lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?"
Lisa Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job."
Bart Simpson,The poor guy. Where's he working?
Marge Simpson,The Kwik-E-Mart.
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I hope you realize that your father can't keep this up."
Lisa Simpson,You're gonna make me give up Princess?
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, we can't make you give up that pony."
Bart Simpson,I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her.
Marge Simpson,"No, Bart. No one's going to make her. This is something Lisa has to decide for herself."
Lisa Simpson,All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, pink hat, when I ordered that blueberry squishee, I meant today."
Homer Simpson,"Coming right up, sir."
Bart Simpson,And fill it to the top this time.
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir."
,
Lisa Simpson,"She likes a little carrot after her oats. And she really likes it when you scratch her behind the ear. And if you're playing the radio, she likes contemporary adult in the morning and easy listening at night. Please take good care of my Princess."
Millicent,"Although there is no change in my patrician facade, I can assure you my heart is breaking."
Lisa Simpson,I'll never forget you.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"What--- wha, da, you call this melted cheese receptacle clean? Eh, the young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you don't have to do this."
Homer Simpson,"Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money..."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I understand the sacrifice you've made for me. That's why I gave up the pony."
Homer Simpson,You did?
,
Lisa Simpson,Hmmm hmmm. There's a big dumb animal I love even more than that horse.
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!"
Lisa Simpson,"I mean you, you dummy."
Homer Simpson,Awww.
Homer Simpson,Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!
Lisa Simpson,"Giddyup, Dad."
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"He slept, he stole, he was rude to the customers... still, there goes the best damn employee a convenience store ever had."
,
Announcer,Products you could only imagine before. The Foam Doam...the Jet Walker...Mr. Sugar Cube...
Homer Simpson,That baby changed our lives.
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Thank you, Troy. Hi, everybody."
Audience,"Hi, Dr. Nick."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Troy, I've brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul Edgar Allan Poe."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Not so fast Troy! With one application of Spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm."
Homer Simpson,Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?"
Homer Simpson,In the garage.
Bart Simpson,Check.
Dr. Nick Riviera,I'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, give us a break, Doctor."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Homer, I can't find the safety goggles for the power saw."
Homer Simpson,"If stuff starts flying, just turn your head."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, check."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Okay. I'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of Kansas Jell-O mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, calm down."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, can you get the door? It's my sisters."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, be nice."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I will. I will."
Homer Simpson,"Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise."
Patty Bouvier,"What do you know, he's wearing pants."
Selma Bouvier,I owe you a lunch.
Patty Bouvier,Ugly... ugly... butch...
Marge Simpson,"What's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like?"
Patty Bouvier,No... Hold the phone. That's the one for me.
Marge Simpson,Ed Asner?
Patty Bouvier,"No, next to him. Mary... Tyler... Moore."
Homer Simpson,"... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?"
Homer Simpson,Shh! They'll hear you.
Marge Simpson,Who's using the power tools?
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Some guy I guess.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we're going to the beauty parlor. Maybe you should do something with the kids while I'm gone."
,
Lisa Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,How much?
Lisa Simpson,Everything.
Homer Simpson,"What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?"
Lisa Simpson,Uh... take us to the video store.
Homer Simpson,Anything for my little girl.
Homer Simpson,Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooooh, McBain."
Scoey,"Hey McBain, you keep eating them hot links and you'll never make it to a pension."
Scoey,"No, thanks. Got me a future, partner. I'm two days away from retirement, my daughter's graduating from college --"
Scoey,And as soon as we nail Mendoza my old lady and I are gonna sail around the world like we always wanted. We just christened the boat.
Scoey,"Yes, sir, everything's gonna be just perf..."
Scoey,"Aw, damn, damn, damn. McBain..."
Scoey,I'm not gonna make it.
Scoey,"No, no, no. Just do one thing for me... Get... Mendoza."
Teenage Clerk,"You want to rent it, sir?"
Homer Simpson,Why? I just saw the best part.
,
Lisa Simpson,"But, Dad, I can't find ""Happy Little Elves in Tinkly Winkly Town""."
Homer Simpson,Just grab something. All these movies are great.
,
Patty Bouvier,"Look at this. ""Test your F.Q. -- Fatherhood Quotient"". Maybe you should try it on Homer. He'll fail it."
Selma Bouvier,Uh-huh. In a second.
Marge Simpson,I don't know.
Selma Bouvier,"Now Henry Winkler, there's a father. Listen to what he told a close friend. ""I don't always keep my cool like `The Fonz', but my love for my kids has given me plenty of 'Happy Days'."""
,
Football Announcer,"... They called him ""The Galloping Gazelle."" His habitat: the frozen tundra of Soldier Field. For six seasons and two pro bowls he grazed on the tasty green turf of the end zone. Until one fateful Sunday in November when the gazelle was stopped in his tracks by a big cat named Wayne Kychezski."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, we're back."
Selma Bouvier,"Don't mind that clod, Patty. You could turn the world on with your smile."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, could you turn off the TV? There's a little test I want you to take."
Homer Simpson,"Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman."
Marge Simpson,This is from the National Fatherhood Institute. It evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
Homer Simpson,Oh Marge.
Marge Simpson,"Question one: ""Name one of your child's friends..."""
Homer Simpson,"Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets."
Marge Simpson,"They want a name, Homer, not a vague description."
Homer Simpson,Okay. Hank.
Marge Simpson,Hank?! Hank who?
Homer Simpson,Hank... Jones.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you made that up. Question two: ""Who is your son's hero?"""
Homer Simpson,Steve McQueen.
Marge Simpson,"That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
Homer Simpson,Next.
Marge Simpson,What are your son's hobbies?
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord."
Marge Simpson,He hasn't done that since he was two.
Homer Simpson,Then he has no hobbies.
Marge Simpson,"Oh really? Well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see."
Homer Simpson,Bart!... BART!!!
Bart Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,"You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
Bart Simpson,"No, not really."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?"
Bart Simpson,Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's a hobby!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, so it is."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!"
Selma Bouvier,You're also fat.
Homer Simpson,I'm also fat!
Dave,National Fatherhood Institute. Please hold...
Gulliver Dark,AND THE CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / LITTLE BOY BLUE AND THE MAN IN THE MOON / WHEN YOU COMIN' HOME DAD / I DON'T KNOW WHEN...
Dave,National Fatherhood Institute. Dave speaking.
Homer Simpson,I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero.
Barney Gumble,"Wow, it really is you."
Dave,"Good Lord, a zero! Lona, cancel my one o'clock. Mr. Simpson, we'll send a wood paneled station wagon over for you immediately."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, where'd you get the lumber?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, ""Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine."""
Martin Prince,A conventional design.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin?"
Martin Prince,"In between some other projects. Well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've booked some time at the wind tunnel."
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, son."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away."
Bart Simpson,Maybe it's for the best.
,
Dave,"For starters, Mr. Simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of ""Fatherhood"" by Bill Cosby."
Homer Simpson,"Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold."
Dave,"Mr. Simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?"
Dave,Why don't you ask him yourself?
Dave,"Homer, meet Dave Jr."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Dave,"How's your research coming, son?"
DAVE JR.,I think we're near a breakthrough.
Dave,Good work.
DAVE JR.,"Thanks, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how I envy you!"
Dave,"Homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. It took years of effort."
Homer Simpson,I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
Dave,"Aw, that's the spirit, Mr. Simpson. Now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. Does the boy have any interests?"
Homer Simpson,What boy?
Dave,Your son. Find something he likes to do and share in it.
Homer Simpson,"Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer."
Dave,"Aw, that would be perfect."
Dave,Dear God! Not again.
,
Homer Simpson,Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer.
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, but I'm almost done. Why don't you get back on the couch and watch TV?"
Homer Simpson,"Okay. No, I'm gonna do it."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dad's help."
Homer Simpson,But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree.
Homer Simpson,"What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you."
Bart Simpson,"Come on Dad, it'd be weird."
Homer Simpson,Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second.
Homer Simpson,"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that sounds too complicated."
Homer Simpson,"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you."
Bart Simpson,"Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes."
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!"
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"I like our chances, son."
Official,"Ugh. Your father is not supposed to help build your racer, but you should at least consult him about it."
Homer Simpson,
Official,"You're in heat four. Whoa, where's your helmet, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Helmets are for wusses, Sir."
Official,I don't think I can let you go without a safety helmet.
,
Homer Simpson,This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!
Official,"Okay, fine. I want to get out of here sometime today."
Martin Prince,"Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold!"
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Official,"Hey, you're not supposed to smoke in the pit area."
Nelson Muntz,Fine.
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Simpson, where's your loser-mobile?"
Homer Simpson,"Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
Bart Simpson,"It's over there, Nelson."
Nelson Muntz,"Whoa, talk about your pieces of crap."
Martin Prince,"You know, Bart, I don't care who wins, as long as one of us beats that guy."
Nelson Muntz,"Careful, boys. It took me months to steal that bumper."
Voice From Trunk,Help! Help!
Bart Simpson,What was that?
Nelson Muntz,You didn't hear nothin'.
Homer Simpson,Are you nervous son?
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, ""Gravity is my co-pilot."""
Weasel #1,"Hey boss, just in case you need it."
Nelson Muntz,Thanks guys.
Nelson Muntz,Now get out of here.
Martin Prince,Oh my. I didn't realize this hill was so high. Could I have another minute -- Aaah!
Martin Prince,Aieee!
Martin Prince,"Deploy, damn you, deploy!"
,
Martin Prince,It hurts! It hurts! Owee-owee-owee-ow!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Young man, I'm afraid this stress fracture will require you to be in a cast for six weeks."
Martin Prince,But that means I can't possibly race!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Son, you're lucky to be alive."
Martin Prince,"Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor."
Bart Simpson,Is it okay to visit?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Of course.
Bart Simpson,"Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death."
Martin Prince,"Thanks, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build 'em like you."
Martin Prince,That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. I'll never race again.
Bart Simpson,"If you don't race, then Nelson'll win!"
Martin Prince,"Even if I wanted to, I'm in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it."
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
Bart Simpson,"Dad... I don't know how to say this, but I don't want to drive your car. It's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart..."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win."
Homer Simpson,When did I ever teach you that?
Bart Simpson,"Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martin's car I can win. I'm sorry, but..."
Homer Simpson,"Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad."
Homer Simpson,"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."
Homer Simpson,Ow.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, can you take me to Dr. Hibbert's office?"
Homer Simpson,Why? What's wrong?
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?"
,
Homer Simpson,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Martin, your bone is healing nicely."
Martin Prince,Tell me something I don't know.
Homer Simpson,"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!"
Moe Szyslak,Figure of speech.
Martin Prince,"Mr. Simpson, you have every right to be angry. But rest assured, your son loves you..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,You certainly gave that boy the heebie-jeebies.
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, aren't you coming?"
Homer Simpson,No!
Marge Simpson,"Now, don't pout."
Homer Simpson,"I'm not pouting, you are."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge."
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Marge Simpson,Don't you at least have something to say to Bart?
Homer Simpson,No. Can't think of a thing.
Marge Simpson,Homer! I've always said you were a good father. I've always defended you when people put you down.
Selma Bouvier,That's for sure.
Patty Bouvier,She ain't lyin'.
Marge Simpson,But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father.
Homer Simpson,Leave me alone.
British Commentator,"Good morning, everybody, and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the Great Depression -- The Soapbox Derby."
British Commentator,"In just minutes, these junior Al Unser Juniors will lock horns."
Homer Simpson,"Name your son's hobbies. Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""..."
Homer Simpson,Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
Ned Flanders,Hey ho Simpson.
Homer Simpson,Shut up Flanders. Flanders!
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, there are two schools of thought..."
Homer Simpson,"Great, thanks."
Homer Simpson,"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!"
,
Barney Gumble,My friend and I have a bet -- Are you Mary Tyler Moore?
Martin Prince,"Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you?"
Bart Simpson,Kill spectators.
Martin Prince,What is the matter with you?
Bart Simpson,"It's my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. I've never seen him like that."
Martin Prince,Forget about your father. You're driving for me now!
Homer Simpson,"Do it for your old man, boy!"
Nelson Muntz,"Simpson, prepare to die."
Bart Simpson,Let's rock.
P.A. Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, to drop the checkered flag, our beloved Mayor, Diamond Joe Quimby."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"To everyone participating today, I salute your vigor. Check out the rack on the blonde in the fourth row."
British Commentator,"... like the arrogant Roman and Judah Ben Hur, these modern charioteers battle ferociously. No quarter given, none asked."
British Commentator,The world has not seen the likes of this since the French carried Lucky Lindy off on their shoulders from Le Bourget Field.
P.A. Announcer,"And now, to present the trophy, three time Soapbox Derby Champion, Ronnie Beck."
Ronnie,Congratulations Bart. Seeing you out there brought back a lot of memories.
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad."
,
Martin Prince,"I might remind you both, I did design that racer. The driver is essentially ballast."
Nelson Muntz,"The better man won, Simpson. You can really drive."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Nelson, put her there."
Bart Simpson,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!"
Homer Simpson,"That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
Bart Simpson,"Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
,
Kent Brockman,"Hello, I'm Kent Brockman and this is Eye on Springfield."
,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, infotainment."
Kent Brockman,"Tonight, we solute the silver anniversary of the great Springfield tire yard fire. Twenty-five years and stilll burning strong."
Kent Brockman,...We watch Springfield's oldest man meet Springfield's fattest man...
Homer Simpson,He's not so fat.
Kent Brockman,"And we visit with Heavyweight Champion, Drederick Tatum, who reminisces about growing up in Springfield."
DREDERICK,"That town is a dump. If you ever see me back there, you know I really up bad."
Kent Brockman,"But first, part seven of our eye-opening look at... the bikini!"
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, T and A."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, why are you still up?"
Bart Simpson,Lisa's slumber party.
Bart Simpson,Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
Homer Simpson,"Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego."
JANEY,"Lisa, your brother is so gross!"
Lisa Simpson,You should smell his room.
JANEY,"Now remember, Wanda, whatever shape the wax takes, that's what your husband's job will be."
Wanda,It's a mop. My husband will be a janitor.
Lisa Simpson,That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career.
Wanda,It's a dustpan.
Lisa Simpson,The wax never lies.
Becky,Let's play truth or dare.
Girls,"Truth or dare, truth or dare."
Becky,"I'll take -- ""dare""."
JANEY,I dare you to -- kiss Lisa's brother.
Girls,Eeeeeewwwwww!
Bart Simpson,What the... ?
Bart Simpson,Aaahhh!
Bart Simpson,Ptew!! Ptew!! I'm telling Mom and Dad.
Lisa Simpson,You're telling who?
Becky,Mom and Dad!
Girls,Jinx!
JANEY,Now you can't talk until somebody says your name!
Kent Brockman,"Coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush!"
Homer Simpson,"What is it, boy?"
Homer Simpson,"Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man."
Homer Simpson,"Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?"
Bart Simpson,"Because I'm ""jinxed"" dammit!"
Bart Simpson,Ow! What was that for?
Homer Simpson,"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh."
JANEY,There he is! Let's give him a make-over.
Homer Simpson,Run for it boy!
Lisa Simpson,"Come here, Maggie."
Homer Simpson,That's it. I'm outta here.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hiya, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, things are tough all over."
Moe Szyslak,Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
Homer Simpson,Could I get a beer?
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, sure."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh sorry, I forgot we're out of beer."
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the ""Love Tester""."
Moe Szyslak,"You're too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad."
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at Bartender's School."
Moe Szyslak,Gin and... tonic? Do they mix?
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself..."
,
Homer Simpson,One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.
Selma Bouvier,... and this is Patty trying to plug her leg razor into one of those ungodly Czechoslovakian outlets.
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Harv."
Selma Bouvier,"As you can see, we never did get the hang of it."
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Homer Simpson,"As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink."
Homer Simpson,"Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?"
Patty Bouvier,"If you're going for a beer, this is the last one."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
Homer Simpson,In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup.
Homer Simpson,It passed the first test: I didn't go blind.
Patty Bouvier,"They say everyone can float in the Dead Sea, but Selma sank right to the bottom."
Homer Simpson,"I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?"
Homer Simpson,"A ""Flaming Homer""."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, why don't you make us up a couple of ""Flaming Homers""?"
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, let me check the lost and found."
Moe Szyslak,"What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye..."
Moe Szyslak,Oh. Here we are.
Moe Szyslak,It's not without its charm.
Homer Simpson,Try lighting it on fire.
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited."
Larry,"Hey, your Love Tester's busted. I want my nickel back."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, buddy. Have one on the house."
Larry,"Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's called a ""Flaming..."
Moe Szyslak,"Moe! It's called a ""Flaming Moe""! That's right, a ""Flaming Moe"". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, what's this?"
Moe Szyslak,A sneeze guard.
Barney Gumble,"Wow, it really works."
HARV,I'll be back.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
Moe Szyslak,Who can say? It's probably a combination of things.
Patron #1,"Another pitcher of those amazing ""Flaming Moe's""."
Patron #2,"Boy, I hate this joint, but I love that drink."
Collette,"Barkeep, I couldn't help noticing your sign."
Moe Szyslak,"The one that says, ""Bartenders Do It 'Til You Barf""?"
Collette,"No, above that store-bought drollery."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh great! Why don't we fill out an application? I'll need your name, measurements and turn ons.."
Collette,You really expect me to tell you my measurements?
Moe Szyslak,"You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun."
Collette,what do you offer in the way of salary?
Moe Szyslak,Minimum wage and tips. Of course there are fringe benefits.
Collette,Such as?
Moe Szyslak,An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.
Collette,I prefer to take my vacations someplace hot.
Moe Szyslak,"I like your moxie, kid. You're hired."
Collette,You shan't regret this.
Moe Szyslak,Methinks I shan't.
HARV,"Pardon me, are you the genius behind the ""Flaming Moe""?"
Homer Simpson,Why yes I --
Moe Szyslak,I'm your man.
HARV,"Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for ""Tipsy McStagger's Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium""."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like?"
HARV,"Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He's just a composite of other successful logos."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick."
HARV,"Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I've got a proposition for you."
Moe Szyslak,Keep talkin'.
HARV,"We feel your ""Flaming Moe"" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe."
Moe Szyslak,"No dice. The ""Flaming Moe"" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?"
Barney Gumble,"Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million dollar idea like that."
Homer Simpson,

Martin Prince,"So the next time you use a gas chromatograph, remember to thank Mister A.J.P Martin."
Edna Krabappel,"Brilliant Martin, brilliant. Once again you've wrecked the grading curve. Oh, I pity the poor student who has to follow you. Bart Simpson? You're next."
Bart Simpson,"""The Inventor I Admire"", by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He's my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the ""Flaming Homer""!"
Nelson Muntz,"The ""Flaming Homer""? You mean the ""Flaming Moe"". And your dad didn't invent it, ya wuss. Moe the bartender did."
Edna Krabappel,"Yes, everyone knows that."
Bart Simpson,"It's not true! My father invented that drink, and if you'll allow me to demonstrate..."
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, are those liquor bottles?"
Bart Simpson,I brought enough for everybody.
Edna Krabappel,Take those to the teacher's lounge. You can have what's left at the end of the day.
Bernard,"Good evening, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,"Nice to see you, Bernard."
Bernard,Thank you very much. Right this way.
Photographer,"Krusty, over here!"
Krusty the Clown,What the--?
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Henceforth, this date shall forever be known as ""Flaming Moe's Day."""
Aide,"Uh, sir, this is already Veteran's Day."
Mayor Joe Quimby,It can be two things!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, instead of milk for dinner, can I have a ""Virgin Moe?"""
Marge Simpson,"Honey, what's wrong?"
Homer Simpson,I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
Homer Simpson,Take that off this second!
Bart Simpson,Okay.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, why don't you just go down to Moe's and talk to him? I bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you."
,
,
Bernard,Can I help you sir?
Homer Simpson,I need to talk to Moe.
Bernard,Your name's not on the list.
Homer Simpson,I didn't even tell you my name.
Bernard,"Okay, what's your name?"
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson.
Bernard,Not on the list.
Homer Simpson,But--
Bernard,We're all filled up. Fire laws.
Moe Szyslak,"Ladies and gentlemen, some new buddies of mine stopped by tonight. Maybe we can get 'em to come up here. How about a warm ""Flaming Moe's"" welcome for Aerosmith!"
Aerosmith,"I don't think so, Moe. / Yeah, we're just hangin' out."
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, guys. Free pickled eggs."
Steven Tyler,"Hello, St. Lewis!"

Homer Simpson,You're my kid's teacher!
Edna Krabappel,"Single parent, are we?"
Homer Simpson,No!
Edna Krabappel,"Well, let's pretend you are."
Homer Simpson,Get away from me.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hiya, Homer. How 'bout a beer?"
Homer Simpson,"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer""."
Moe Szyslak,"A what? Oh, I get it."
Homer Simpson,"How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it."
Homer Simpson,"If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
Collette,"Morris, is what this man's saying true?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, it's hard to say. He may have come up with the recipe, but I came up with the idea of charging six ninety-five for it."
Moe Szyslak,"Whoop, telephone."
Moe Szyslak,Flaming Moe's.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, yes, I'm looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh."
Moe Szyslak,"Hold on. I'll check. Hugh Jass, Oh, somebody check the men's room for a Hugh Jass."
HUGH,"Oh, I'm Hugh Jass."
Moe Szyslak,Telephone.
HUGH,"Hello, this is Hugh Jass."
Bart Simpson,Uh... hi.
HUGH,Who's this?
Bart Simpson,Bart Simpson.
HUGH,"What can I do for you, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, look. I'll level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and I'd like to bail out right now."
HUGH,All right. Better luck next time. What a nice young man.
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, I'm sorry you're mad at me, but this isn't personal. This is business."
Homer Simpson,"Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!"
Moe Szyslak,"What? I'm sorry. Homer, I couldn't hear you."
Homer Simpson,"I said, you just lost yourself a customer!"
Moe Szyslak,What?
Homer Simpson,You just lost yourself a customer.
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, you're gonna have to speak up!"
Homer Simpson,"You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!"
Moe Szyslak,I lost myself to what?

HARV,"Well sir, Tipsy McStagger would like to buy your drink."
Moe Szyslak,He's here?!
HARV,"Oh, no, no. I mean my company is willing to do what it takes to get that recipe. We're prepared to offer you one million dollars."
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Harv, but like I told you before, it ain't for sale."
HARV,Don't be stupid. We have a laboratory for this kind of thing. We've got it all figured out except for one ingredient.
,
Professor Jonathan Frink,Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph... the secret ingredient is... love? Who's been screwing with this thing?
,
Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me."
Delivery Man,Thirty cases of cough syrup. Sign here.
Moe Szyslak,I got hooked on this stuff in the service.

Homer Simpson,"Ah, my new watering hole."

One-eyed Bartender,"Yeah, what do you want?!"

Marge Simpson,"So, Mr. Hutz, does my husband have a case?"
Lionel Hutz,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson, but you can't copyright a drink."
Homer Simpson,
Lionel Hutz,"Well, this all goes back to the Frank Wallbanger case of '78. How about that? I looked something up! These books behind me don't just make the office look good, they're filled with useful legal tidbits just like that!"
,
Homer Simpson,Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed...
Marge Simpson,"Well Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
Marge Simpson,"Well, duh."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Now that's what I call a ""Happy Hour""."
Collette,Morris something troubles me.
Moe Szyslak,"Don't worry baby, my mother won't be home for another twenty minutes."
Collette,"No, I was just thinking about Homer Simpson."
Moe Szyslak,"That's okay, I was just thinking about Sybil Danning."
Collette,I meant I think you should sell your drink and give half the money to Homer.
Moe Szyslak,But honey --
Collette,"He's your friend, Morris. And you took advantage of him."
Moe Szyslak,"Alright, alright. I'll split the million with Homer. Jeepers, Mary and Joseph. I sleep with a chick once, it costs me a half a million bananas."
,
Homer Simpson,Moe... Moe... Moe...
Marge Simpson,"Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today?"
Bart Simpson,"Okay, but you promised me moe money."
Marge Simpson,"I moe, I moe."
Homer Simpson,Moe... Moe... Moe.
Lisa Simpson,"When Bart's done, can we moe to the moevies? There's a moetinee."
Marge Simpson,Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe..."
Flowers,"Hey, Homer. Whatsamatter?"
,
Tom Hamilton,"Hey, where's Joey?"
Joey Kramer,"Mrs. Krabappel, I really need my drum sticks."
Edna Krabappel,Come and get 'em.
HARV,"You're gonna be a rich man, Moe. I gotta tell you, the way we usually work in these situations is to steal the recipe and run the inventor out of business. C'est la vie."
Moe Szyslak,What the...
Homer Simpson,"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is..."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, no!"
Homer Simpson,"Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!"
Moe Szyslak,Shoot.
HARV,"Thank you, Mr. Nutball. Gotta go, Moe. Tough luck."
Barney Gumble,Holy cow. You just fell on Aerosmith!
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, come in here."

Homer Simpson,"Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?"
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here."
Homer Simpson,"Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret."
Homer Simpson,I guess so.
Moe Szyslak,"Compliments of the house. One ""Flaming Homer""."
Homer Simpson,"Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?"
Moe Szyslak,I doubt it.

Waylon Smithers,"It's a breakthrough product, sir: scientifically formulated to rinse clean with no oily deposits."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hot dog!
,
Waylon Smithers,And it's mild enough to use every day.
C. Montgomery Burns,Isn't life grand?
Waylon Smithers,"What's wrong sir, did I get some in your eyes? The shampoo specifically said ""No More Tears""."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A lovely promise, but one beyond the powers of a mere shampoo."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, I feel there is something you're not telling me? Perhaps, you'd feel more comfortable talking to Snappy the Alligator."
C. Montgomery Burns,Maybe.
Waylon Smithers,"Hello, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Snappy, do you it's hard to imagine, but I was once a barefoot boy with cheek of tan. I dreamed of grand slam homeruns and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen."
Snappy,"Well there's still time for all those things, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, Snappy."
Snappy,So you feel resentful towards the plant.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, exactly! You know, maybe it's time I sold the old girl."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what do they want!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Maybe a nap will boost my spirits.
Waylon Smithers,"I'll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir."
Homer Simpson,It's not fair!
Waylon Smithers,"I know how you feel, Simpson. I've never seen Mr. Burns so depressed."
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Waylon Smithers,"People think that because he's rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn't have feelings like other men. But he does. And you know what? I bet he wouldn't sell the plant for a hundred million dollars."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's a lot of money."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar?"
Waylon Smithers,"Good, good. Try to eat something."
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson here.
Moe Szyslak,Are you sure? Cuz once I open the bottle there's no refund.
Broker,"Homer, it's your stockbroker. Your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years."
Homer Simpson,I own stock?
Broker,"Yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights."
Homer Simpson,"So uh, how much did it go up?"
Broker,Wait a minute. Let's not do that yet. The book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. Everybody alive?
Homer Simpson,Yeah...
Broker,Like any sports?
Homer Simpson,Sure...
Broker,Ever go dancing?
Homer Simpson,Not any more...
Broker,We should get together sometime.
Homer Simpson,That'd be great.
Broker,There. Now we trust each other.
Homer Simpson,Well... how are you?
Broker,Near death. I'm renewing my notary license on a weekly basis.
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?
Broker,Let me punch that up on the computer.
Broker,Twenty five cents a share.
Homer Simpson,What should I do?
Broker,"Well, let me put it this way. You'll get twenty-five dollars if you sell now."
Homer Simpson,Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
Homer Simpson,"Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer..."
,
Marge Simpson,Bart! Bart! Turn to the financial channel! Aunt Patty says our stock is skyrocketing!
Scott Christian,Unconfirmed takeover rumors have pushed Burns Worldwide from one eighth to fifty-two and a quarter...
Marge Simpson,Your father's stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars!
Bart Simpson,"Wow, fifty-two hundred smackers."
Bart Simpson,
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff?"
Homer Simpson,"No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve."
,
Homer Simpson,"For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy."
Homer Simpson,"Have a Duff, boys!"
Hans,"Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us. Do I have that right? I am saying that only a swine would drink this beer."
Fritz,"Yeah, but thank you anyway."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?"
Hans,"Ech, nein. We are from Germany. He is from the East. I am from the West."
Fritz,I had a big company and he had a big company. Now we have a very big company.
Hans,We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it?
Homer Simpson,"Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
Fritz,A hundred million?
Hans,"Oh, don't worry! We'll still have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns."
,
Marge Simpson,It's the miracle we've been waiting for.
Bart Simpson,What are we going to spend it on?
Patty Bouvier,Homer's probably buying some magic beans with it right now.
Marge Simpson,"We'll have a savings account. We've never had one. Kids, I think everything is going to be okay from now on."
Homer Simpson,Hey... hey!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer!"
Homer Simpson,You heard?
Marge Simpson,We heard! Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too."
Marge Simpson,What do you mean?
Homer Simpson,I spent it on beer.
Selma Bouvier,Surprise surprise.
Marge Simpson,You spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
Homer Simpson,Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?
Homer Simpson,What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
Homer Simpson,Ow!
Bart Simpson,Come on everybody. It makes you feel better.
Carl Carlson,"Hey, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Did you buy this car with your stock money?
Carl Carlson,"Sure did. And the great thing about it is everybody got rich. For once, all us working stiffs got a break."
Homer Simpson,
Charlie,"Hey, wait till you see Lenny. He just got back from the plastic surgeon."
Carl Carlson,"Jeez Lenny, looks like you got the works."
Lenny Leonard,"Well it started out as an eye tuck, but the stock kept going up."
Worker,"Hey, come here, Mr. Burns is on TV."
Kent Brockman,"Mr. Burns, we've heard that a German consortium has offered to purchase the plant. Any comment?"
C. Montgomery Burns,You'll see the Statue of Liberty wearing lederhosen before you see Germans running my plant!
Kent Brockman,"Well then, sir, why are you meeting with them?"
C. Montgomery Burns,So I can look Uncle Fritz square in the monocle and say nein.
,
Waylon Smithers,"Ah, you never cease to amaze me, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whoo! oooh, oooh, Whooo hoo hoo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I grudgingly accept.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, don't worry. I think you'll find that these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie! Hans and Fritz, well that's just John and Frank!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,Ich bin ein Springfielder!
Homer Simpson,We could all lose our jobs.
Marge Simpson,Look at all those worried faces -- except for Lenny. He looks great.
Lenny Leonard,This is the worst day of my life.
Lenny Leonard,Those lousy Germans can't fire me. I'm the only one who knows how to unjam the rod bottom dissociator.
Carl Carlson,"Well, they can't fire me. I'm the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier."
Homer Simpson,"Well, they can't fire me."
Carl Carlson,Why?
Homer Simpson,Cuz... I...
Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's a country in Europe --"
Horst,"Guten morgen, I am Horst. The new owners have elected me to speak with you because I am the most nonthreatening. Perhaps I remind you of the lovable Sergeant Schultz on Hogan's Heroes."
,
,
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, he does."
Horst,What is the best way to an efficient plant?
Horst,Happy workers who feel secure at their jobs. So let's get to know each other better. Do we have any alcoholics among us?
Horst,"You'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in Hawaii, after which you'll return at full pay."
Homer Simpson,Lucky drunks.
Horst,"Also, we cannot uber-emphasize the importance of employee safety."
Horst,We plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!"
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Homer, aren't you the safety inspector?"
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,That's one big check.
German Teacher,"You look sharp today, sir. You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr."
Waylon Smithers,"You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr."
German Teacher,"That was a gutsy decision, sir. Ein wassen das gutsy decisionen, mein herr."
Waylon Smithers,Ein wassen das...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers! Come here, I want you."
C. Montgomery Burns,I wanted to give you something to remember me by. I know you've always had your eye on this photo of Elvis and me.
Waylon Smithers,"He was so good to his mother, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, but I couldn't understand a word that man said. Misht Burnsh, dajna boo mafrn friszner... er hound-dog."
Waylon Smithers,"Stop it, you're killing me sir."
Waylon Smithers,"Oh sir, what will you do next?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, first I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for. Then, who knows? Bee keeping, boxing, bache ball?... The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany?"
Homer Simpson,"Good, good, I'm learning."
Lisa Simpson,One of the economic powers of the world--
Homer Simpson,Because we send them money?
Lisa Simpson,"No. Because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, woa is me."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, come to bed."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it."
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing."
Marge Simpson,"Well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?"
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Battlestar Galactica."
Homer Simpson,"Fit, damn you! Fit!"
Homer Simpson,There.
Bart Simpson,"Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work."
Homer Simpson,Huh? What?
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up!"
Horst,"Homer, could we have a word with you?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Horst,"I must have phrased that badly. My English is, how you say... inelegant. I meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat?"
Homer Simpson,No!
Horst,"Once again, I have failed."
,
Homer Simpson,Auugghh!
Horst,You've been safety inspector for two years. What initiatives have you spearheaded in that time?
Homer Simpson,Uh... all of them?
Horst,I see. Then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.
Homer Simpson,I sure do!
Fritz,Such as...
Homer Simpson,"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
C. Montgomery Burns,This is my park! Get out!
Horst,"We understand Homer. After all, we are from the land of chocolate."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. The land of chocolate...
,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
,
Homer Simpson,La la la la la...
Fritz,Mr. Simpson...
Homer Simpson,La la la la la la...
Fritz,Mr. Simpson...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate?"
Horst,That was ten minutes ago!
Homer Simpson,I think I did pretty good in there.
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, you know those Germans aren't so bad."
Lenny Leonard,"Sure, they've made mistakes in the past, but that's why pencils have erasers."
Horst,Attention workers. We have completed our evaluation of the plant.
Horst,"We regret to announce the following lay-offs, which I will read in alphabetical order. Simpson, Homer. That is all."
,
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Marge Simpson,"Now, Bart, Lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. We all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job."
Lisa Simpson,I made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together.
Marge Simpson,That's very clever.
Bart Simpson,"And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read 'em and left 'em in the store."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
Lisa Simpson,"My jump rope broke, but I just tied it back together."
Marge Simpson,"That's good, Lisa."
Bart Simpson,I didn't take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow.
Marge Simpson,"I want you to take baths, Bart."
Homer Simpson,"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing."
Homer Simpson,No problems here.
Jasper Beardly,"That's right, Burnsie... keep your wrist supple... throw it, don't aim it..."
Grampa Simpson,It was worth it.
Waylon Smithers,"This place has really gone to hell, Mr. Burns. It's obscene what they did to your office."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Listen, Smithers, you caught me at a bad time but my folk guitar class has been canceled for tonight. Would you like to get together for a drink?"
Waylon Smithers,Would I!
C. Montgomery Burns,Fine. I gotta go. See you at six.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're going down, my friend."
Boxer,"Yes sir, Mr. Burns."
Horst,That shouldn't be.
Horst,Raccoons!
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right... gather the nectar, my little drones, and make the honey. Honey for your children."
C. Montgomery Burns,Fools!
Waylon Smithers,"Ready for that drink, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Just a second, Smithers. Let me introduce you to the gang. That's Buzz. That's Honey. And you see that queen over there? Her name is ""Smithers."""
Waylon Smithers,"Ha, ha. That's very flattering, sir. But we should go. Several bees are stinging me."
,
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
Bart Simpson,"Uh yes, I'm looking for a Mrs. O'Problem. First name... Bee."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, yeah. Just a minute, I'll check. Uh, Bee O'Problem. Bee O'Problem. C'mon, guys. Do I have an O'Problem here?"
Barney Gumble,You sure do!
Moe Szyslak,"Awwww. It's you, isn't it?"
Bart Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!"
Bart Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I want you to go down to Moe's Tavern. I need you to bring your father home."
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"Excuse me, I'm looking for --"
Moe Szyslak,Wait a minute. I know that voice.
Moe Szyslak,If it isn't little Bart Simpson! I haven't seen you in years.
Bart Simpson,That's right. That's my pop!
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, little Bart... we hear all about your monkeyshines."
Moe Szyslak,Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he don't even know about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, well, I make some crank phone calls."
Moe Szyslak,"That's great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me?"
Bart Simpson,"Moe, for you... anything?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look! A blue-collar bar! Oh, Smithers, let's go slumming!"
,
Bart Simpson,"EVERY TEDDY BEAR WHO'S BEEN GOOD IS SURE OF A TREAT TODAY/ THERE'S LOTS OF MARVELOUS THINGS TO EAT, AND WONDERFUL GAMES TO PLAY/ BENEATH THE TREES, WHERE NOBODY SEES/ THEY'LL HIDE AND SEEK AS LONG AS THEY PLEASE/ TODAY'S THE DAY THE TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC!"
Moe Szyslak,"He's a pip, this one is!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers, we're going in!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Watch me blend in. Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my ""buddy"" here."
Homer Simpson,"I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, who is this saucy fellow?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated."
Homer Simpson,That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Homer Simpson,Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, no."
Homer Simpson,"And does it ever say, ""I love you?"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, it doesn't."
Homer Simpson,"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!"
Homer Simpson,Nobody loves you...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Good heavens, Smithers! They're not afraid of me anymore!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Letter? I don't recall any letter...
Bart Simpson,That's because I forgot to stamp it.
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, that kid slays me."
C. Montgomery Burns,That was no accident. Let's get out of here.
Homer Simpson,Na na na na / Na na na na /
Barflies,Hey hey hey / Goodbye -- Na na na na / na na na na / hey hey hey / goodbye...
C. Montgomery Burns,What good is money if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I've got to get my plant back!
,
Hans,Gott in himmel! Who'd have thought a nuclear plant could be such a deathtrap.
Fritz,It will cost us another hundred million just to bring it up to code.
C. Montgomery Burns,Please sell me my plant back! I'll pay anything.
Horst,"Isn't this a happy coincidence? You are desperate to buy, and we are desperate to sell."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Desperate, eh? Advantage, Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks."
Hans,"But Mr. Burns, this is half of what we paid you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's my final offer, take it or leave it."
Horst,"All right, Mr. Burns. You win. But beware. We Germans aren't all smiles and sunshine."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I'm so scared. Ooh, the Germans."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh-oh, the Germans are comin' to get me. Oh, don't let the Germans come after me... Oh no, the Germans are coming after me. Oh, no, they're so big and strong..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Get out! This is my office now! Get out!
C. Montgomery Burns,"You too. This is a place of business, not a Peewee flop house!"
Waylon Smithers,"Your orders, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Restore my office. Cancel all repairs. And rehire that chap who sassed me in the bar.
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, but why?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers. I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer. He'll slowly regain his confidence as the months and years drift by, blissfully unaware that the sword of Damocles is dangling just above his head."
C. Montgomery Burns,And then one day... when he least expects it --
,
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I got my job back!
,
Marge Simpson,"""Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test""? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe."
Marge Simpson,"Okay, let's see... ""Ahoy maties! If the water turns blue, a baby for you. If purple ye see, no baby thar be""."
Homer Simpson,"Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?"
Marge Simpson,Pink.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"""If ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail"". Well, I guess I'd better go see Dr. Hibbert."
Homer Simpson,"Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix I did with the other kids."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'll let you know."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Homer, how come Mom's going to the doctor?"
Lisa Simpson,Is anything wrong?
Homer Simpson,"No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg."
Lisa Simpson,What?
Bart Simpson,I smell a bun in the oven.
Lisa Simpson,"Is Mom gonna have another baby, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,Maybe.
Bart Simpson,"You're a machine, Homer."
Lisa Simpson,Did you hear that Maggie? Another baby in the house.
Bart Simpson,"Ohhh, cool, we can race them."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings."
Lisa Simpson,Doesn't Mom do that stuff?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I have to hear about it."
Bart Simpson,Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me?
Homer Simpson,"Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, what do you think about?"
Homer Simpson,"Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!"
,
Homer Simpson,For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
Mr. Thorson,"Homer, you're turning the blades too fast. The golfers are complaining. Slow down!"
Mr. Thorson,"That's better. Ah, beautiful. Keep this up and someday you'll be the guy who hands out the putters."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir."
,
Homer Simpson,"I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!"
Bart Simpson,"I thought it was over. You had a problem turning a blade, you overcame it. The feel-good story of the year."
Lisa Simpson,"It's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, Dad. We watch an appalling amount of TV."
Homer Simpson,"Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh..."
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.
Homer Simpson,Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
,
Mother,"Okay girls, you can smoke now."
Selma Bouvier,Umm... Oh yeah...
Marge Simpson,It's Homer!
Patty Bouvier,I don't know what you see in that ugly meatball.
Selma Bouvier,"Uh-huh. If you like being pawed by something fat and lazy, we could get a cat."
Mother,It would leave less hair on the couch.
Marge Simpson,You don't know Homer like I do. He's sensitive and sweet.
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you ever think about the future?"
Homer Simpson,You mean like will apes be our masters?
Marge Simpson,"No, I mean how you plan to earn a living. I can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating."
Homer Simpson,But it gives me time to think.
Homer Simpson,"Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!"
Marge Simpson,"I think about you, too."
Homer Simpson,"Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer."
,
Marge Simpson,YOU LIGHT UP MY DAYS / AND FILL MY NIGHTS / WITH SONG.... IT CAN'T BE WRONG / WHEN IT FEELS SO GOO/RIGHT / CAUSE YOU -- YOU
Marge Simpson,Our song.
Homer Simpson,I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
Marge Simpson,"Actually, she was singing about God."
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad."
,
,
Homer Simpson,Someday I'll buy you a real castle.
Marge Simpson,You don't have to do that.
Homer Simpson,"Phew, good."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy."
Homer Simpson,Really? It must be the Champale talking.
Marge Simpson,What if we get caught?
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!
,
Homer Simpson,Pass the cookie dough.
Charlie,"Dust off your hula skirts, Angels, I'm afraid there's been a murder - in Hawaii!"

Marge Simpson,So You've Ruined Your Life.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Son, you gotta marry that girl!"
Homer Simpson,Because it's the honorable thing to do?
Grampa Simpson,"No, because you'll never do any better. You lucky bum! The fish jumped right in the boat. All you gotta do is whack her with the oar."
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I haven't said no to you lately, have I?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?"
Marge Simpson,What card?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
Marge Simpson,Is this it?
Homer Simpson,What's it say?
Marge Simpson,"""Marge, from the first moment I saw you I never wanted to be with anyone else. I don't have much to offer you... except all my love. Will you marry me?"""
Homer Simpson,That's the card. Give it here.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
Homer Simpson,So... will you marry me?
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo!"

Lisa Simpson,Ariel.
Bart Simpson,Kool Moe Dee.
Homer Simpson,"You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I've been thinking. If the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name Larry?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy."
Marge Simpson,"Well, how about Louie?"
Homer Simpson,They'll call him Screwy Louie.
Marge Simpson,Bob?
Homer Simpson,Slob.
Marge Simpson,Luke?
Homer Simpson,Puke.
Marge Simpson,Marcus?
Homer Simpson,Mucous.
Marge Simpson,What about Bart?
Homer Simpson,"Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!"
Clerk,"Yes sir, and how will you be paying for it?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
,
Homer Simpson,"Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."
,
Lunchlady Doris,Basic ceremony's twenty bucks. Here's your license.
Lunchlady Doris,Be sure to get this punched every time. The tenth wedding is on the house.
Homer Simpson,Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever.
Lunchlady Doris,"No matter how many times I hear that, it always makes me laugh."
,
Justice Of The Peace,"Cletus, do you take Aline to be your lawful wedded wife?"
Groom,Yup.
Justice Of The Peace,Done. Next.
Marge Simpson,There certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'd be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day... But you are how I pictured my husband."
Homer Simpson,I am?
Marge Simpson,"Well, you may not look like Ted Bessell, but you're just as nice."
Homer Simpson,
Justice Of The Peace,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God and this casino to join..."
Homer Simpson,Homer.
Justice Of The Peace,... and...
Marge Simpson,Marge.
Justice Of The Peace,... in holy matrimony. Beautiful.
Patty Bouvier,Don't be stupid.
Justice Of The Peace,"Do you, Marjorie Bouvier, take Homer J. Simpson to be your lawful wedded husband?"
Marge Simpson,I do.
Justice Of The Peace,"Homer, same question, names reversed."
Homer Simpson,I do.
Justice Of The Peace,"Then, by the power vested in me by the state gaming commission, I pronounce you man and wife. Here's ten dollars worth of chips, you may kiss the bride."

Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well."

Homer Simpson,Pfft. Now you tell me.

Waylon Smithers,"We only have two openings, so I'm afraid one of you will have to go home empty-handed... But it won't be my old frat buddy, Lou Collier. How ya doin', you old Alpha Tau!"

Applicant #2,I push myself too hard.
Homer Simpson,"Dear Marge, XXX. Homer."
Homer Simpson,Well... It takes me a long time to learn anything... I'm kind of a goof-off...
Waylon Smithers,"Okay, that'll do."
Homer Simpson,... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.
Waylon Smithers,"That's enough! Next: there's a problem with the reactor, what do you do?"
Homer Simpson,There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!

Repo Man,Repo Man! I'm here for the baby's things.
Homer Simpson,
Repo Man,"Crib, mobile, monitor... oh, and the lady's ring, I'm afraid."
Marge Simpson,Oh dear...
Repo Man,Repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."""
Patty Bouvier,Shut up with that pen-scratching down there!
Homer Simpson,I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man.
,
Lisa Simpson,That is so sad.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?"
Homer Simpson,Okay.
,
Marge Simpson,"""You will not see me again until I am a man."" Oh, Homer, Homer."

Marge Simpson,Homer... Come home with me.
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
Marge Simpson,Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, for you."
Marge Simpson,Aww...
Marge Simpson,Would you mind if I took it off now? The oil is burning my finger.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you know why I married you?"
Homer Simpson,Because I knocked you up?
Marge Simpson,"No, because I love you."
Marge Simpson,Come home soon.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,That's it. That's it. Come closer...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ironic, isn't it. The hunter has become the hunted. Oh God, Smithers, I feel so alive."
Homer Simpson,You the boss?
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes.
Waylon Smithers,"I'll call security, sir."
Homer Simpson,Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
Homer Simpson,"Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hold the phone, Smithers... I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, this man not only failed the aptitude test, he got trapped in a closet on his way out."
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't care. I haven't been this impressed since I first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named Waylon Smithers.
Homer Simpson,You mean?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome aboard, son."
Homer Simpson,I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!

Homer Simpson,"Marge! Marge, where's the baby?"
Patty Bouvier,Right where you left it.
Homer Simpson,Shut up!
Patty Bouvier,"Hey, listen fatboy --"
Homer Simpson,"No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, does this mean --"
Homer Simpson,"Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Good God.
Homer Simpson,"And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!"
Marge Simpson,Doesn't your job start tomorrow?
Homer Simpson,"Eh, somebody'll cover for me."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's -- Ohh!"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Uh, why don't you let me handle it, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, college boy, eh?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, for God's sakes, let him deliver the baby!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, isn't he beautiful?"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel."
Homer Simpson,Why you little... He did that on purpose!
Marge Simpson,How could he? He's only ten minutes old.
,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute..."
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have."
Homer Simpson,"As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more."

,
Bart Simpson,Wha th...?
Patty Bouvier,It's a label maker.
Selma Bouvier,Mmm-hmm. We have one at home. Before we got it I was always finding Patty's stubble in my leg razor.
Bart Simpson,Ehhh...

Marge Simpson,Bart! Be polite.

Homer Simpson,"Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!"
Marge Simpson,Wha'd you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion.
Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,What a crappy birthday.
Bart Simpson,"What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids."
Marge Simpson,"Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does."
Marge Simpson,"Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, it does work!"
Marge Simpson,I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father?
Bart Simpson,Hmmm.
,
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm. Chocolate.
Homer Simpson,

Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel! That was uncalled for!
Milhouse Van Houten,Bravo!
Nelson Muntz,"Well done, old man."
,
Bart Simpson,Rod... Todd... this is God.
Rod Flanders,How did you get on the radio?
Todd Flanders,Forgive my brother. We believe you.
Bart Simpson,Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later.
Todd Flanders,What do you want from us?
Bart Simpson,I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch.
Rod Flanders,But those cookies belong to our parents.
Bart Simpson,"Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?"
Rod Flanders,Happy God.
Bart Simpson,Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies.
Todd Flanders,"Yes, sir."
,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Whoops!
Bart Simpson,Help! Help!
Groundskeeper Willie,Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a-brewin' at the old well.
Bart Simpson,"Help me, please! I fell down the well!"
Groundskeeper Willie,"I'll get help, laddie!"
Groundskeeper Willie,A little nip of courage.
Groundskeeper Willie,"Out of my way! Look out, you horse's arse!"
Bart Simpson,Sucker.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's up?"

Bart Simpson,Yes!
,
Bart Simpson,My name is Timmy O'Toole. I just turned ten years old.
Dave Shutton,"Timmy, where are your parents?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes."
Seymour Skinner,He's a liar!
Crowd,Booooooo!
Kent Brockman,"The circumference of the well is thirty-four inches. So, unfortunately, not one member of our city's police force is slender enough to rescue the boy."
Chief Wiggum,"By God, men -- you're a bunch of marshmallows!"
Fat Cop,"Why don't you go, Chief?"
Chief Wiggum,I'm too... important.
Lisa Simpson,Is it Sherri?
Kent Brockman,"Although the well is too dark to see the boy, Timmy has told us his foot is trapped under a rock. Thus, any attempt to pull him up would snap him like a twig."
Kent Brockman,"In desperation, the city is considering more unorthodox solutions."
Falcon Man,"Grasping the child firmly in his talons, Socrates here will fly him to safety! Just watch!"
Falcon Man,I don't think he's coming back.
Sailor,"With this hook, and this hunk of chocolate, I'll land your boy. And I'll clean him for free."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Although we can't reach your boy, we can freeze him with liquid nitrogen so that future generations can rescue him."
,
Marge Simpson,"Dear Lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little Timmy O'Toole, trapped in that well."
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Bart! What's wrong with you?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero."
Lisa Simpson,"How do you mean, dad?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
Lisa Simpson,How does that make him a hero?
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's more than you did!"
Kent Brockman,"And finally, Channel Six's own Krusty the Clown has gathered members of the entertainment community -- who normally steer clear of fashionable causes -- for a video called ""We're Sending Our Love Down The Well."""
Krusty the Clown,"I wanted to do something to help that boy. So I called my good friend Sting. He said, ""Krusty, when do you need me?"" I said Thursday -- he said, ""I'm busy Thursday"" -- I said, ""What about Friday?"" He said, ""Friday's worse than Thursday."" Then he said, ""How about Saturday?"" I said, ""Fine."" True story."
Sting,"Yeah, I used to open for Krusty in uh, '69. In fact, he fired me as I recall."
Krusty the Clown,Sting.
Sting,"But this isn't about show business. This is about some kid down a hole, or something, and we've all got to do what we can."
Sting,THERE'S A HOLE IN MY HEART / AS DEEP AS A WELL / FOR THAT POOR LITTLE BOY / WHO'S STUCK HALF-WAY TO HELL.
Sideshow Mel,THOUGH WE CAN'T GET HIM OUT / WE'LL DO THE NEXT BEST THING.
Groundskeeper Willie,Gas! Out of the hole!
Choir,AND WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown,ALL THE WAY DOWN.
Choir,WE'RE SENDING OUR LOVE DOWN THE WELL!
Krusty the Clown,DOWN THAT WELL!
Kent Brockman,"Krusty, what are your plans for the royalties?"
Krusty the Clown,"Well, we gotta pay for promotion, shipping, distribution... you know, those limos out back -- they aren't free... Whatever's left, we throw down the well."
,
Souvenir Hawker,Authentic Timmy O'Toole baby teeth! Six dollars a bag!
Bernard,Step to the rear... plenty of room in the back.
,
Lisa Simpson,Awww.
Bart Simpson,"Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy!"
Station Announcer,This is a special report from Channel Six news.
Kent Brockman,"Disturbing news from the old town well, where young Timmy O'Toole has apparently taken a turn for the worse."
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"I... a, it's very simple, Kent. The child is reverting to a feral, or wolf-like, state. Here's an artist's conception."
Lisa Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,"I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. Goodnight everybody."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out you've been fooling them, they're gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors."
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out?
Lisa Simpson,The police will catch you sooner or later.
Bart Simpson,The police. They couldn't catch a cold.
Lisa Simpson,"Maybe not, but I bet you're stupid enough to have left a ""Property of Bart Simpson"" label on that radio."
Bart Simpson,

Lou,"And Cinderella had the most beautiful gown at the ball. With eight satin petticoats, each more delicate than the last. I think he's asleep."
Eddie,Want to get a cup of coffee?
Lou,Okay. Brave little guy.
Eddie,"Hey, I almost tripped over this thing."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,What did I do to deserve this?
Bart Simpson,Help! Help! I fell down the well.
Eddie,Tell us something we don't know.
Bart Simpson,No! My name is Bart Simpson!
Lou,What are you doing down there?
Bart Simpson,"Look, I'll level with you. There is no Timmy O'Toole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody."
Lou,"Well, you sure fooled us, kid."
Eddie,"Hey, I got an idea for a prank. Let's go home and go to sleep. ."
Lou,"Good one, Eddie."
Bart Simpson,"Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. Guys?"
,
Lou,So I'm afraid your son is trapped down the well.
Homer Simpson,You must think we're the worst parents in the world.
Eddie,"Yeah, that's... pretty much the feeling down at the station."
,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll..."
Bart Simpson,Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, don't make me come down there!"
Bart Simpson,Like to see you fit.
Homer Simpson,"Why, you little --"
Mayor Joe Quimby,Put a man on him.
Old Lady #1,I liked the other boy. So polite.
Marge Simpson,What are you doing to save my baby boy?
Chief Wiggum,"Uh well, ma'am, we've located a piece of machinery in Shreveport, Louisiana, that could pop him out lickety-split."
Marge Simpson,"Well, why don't you get it?"
Chief Wiggum,"Well, I'm afraid we've got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo."
Marge Simpson,You're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
Chief Wiggum,"Well, they would have for Timmy. People loved that little guy. But your son, well, he kinda played us all for a bunch of saps."
Marge Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Gentlemen, this canary died of natural causes."
Groundskeeper Willie,Back in the hole!
Bart Simpson,No!
Kent Brockman,"So it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. The time has come for finger-pointing. And most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents."
Homer Simpson,"It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Uh, could you edit that last part out?"
Kent Brockman,"Mr. Simpson, we're live coast-to-coast."
Homer Simpson,
Wanda,One plus one plus three is five/ Little Bart Simpson's buried alive / He's so neat / He's so sweet / Now the rats have Bart to eat.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, stop that!"
JANEY,"Sorry, Lisa."
JANEY,"How many days until Bart croaks. One, two, three, four..."
D.J.,"And our new number one hit, ""I Do Believe We're Naked"", by Funky C Funky Do, replaces ""We're Sending Our Love Down The Well"", which plunges all the way down to number ninety-seven."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Ever since I've called for the rescue of that Simpson lad, I 'Have taken a lot of heat. So, I am flip-flopping. I say, ""Let him stay down there!"""
Dave Shutton,"Yeah, Shutton here. Now that's a story!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, it's too big."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, you'll grow into it."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Bart Simpson,"You know, I've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now I'm paying the price. But there's so many things I'll never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair..."
Homer Simpson,"That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Now, why didn't I think of that?"
Groundskeeper Willie,"Agnes, we've got work to do."

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,The canary!
Marge Simpson,"Sting, you look tired. Maybe you should take a rest."
Sting,Not while one of my fans needs me.
Marge Simpson,"Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--"
Homer Simpson,"Shh! Marge, he's a good digger."
Bart Simpson,Sting!
Bart Simpson,Mom! Dad!
Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, I've missed you so much."
Bart Simpson,"Man, I was so scared."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again."

Groundskeeper Willie,That should do it.
Bret,"Hey everybody, Bret Gunsilman here in pivotal week three of the NFL on Fox."
,
Bret,Now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
Homer Simpson,"Well, bye-bye belt."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart."
Homer Simpson,"Pfft, my heart is just fine."
Homer Simpson,A little beer will put out that fire.
Bret,"And now with his picks for today's games, the man who's right fifty-two percent of the time, Smooth Jimmy Apollo."
JIMMY,"Thank you, Bret. Our first game today -- Denver and New England -- is too close to call."
Homer Simpson,
JIMMY,"But if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, I don't know... uh... Denver."
Homer Simpson,"Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!"
,
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver."
Moe Szyslak,"I think I can provide that service. Um, uh, Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book?"
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster."
Homer Simpson,Twenty big ones on Denver.
Moe Szyslak,"Pleasure doing business with you, H. S."

Football Announcer,"At the end of thirteen seconds of play, it's New England seven, Denver nothing."
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Look, Dad. I made a modest studio apartment for my Malibu Stacey doll. This is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter..."
Lisa Simpson,DAAAAAD! You're not listening to me.
Homer Simpson,"Lousy, stupid Denver."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever."
Lisa Simpson,Why isn't Dad ever interested in anything I do?
Marge Simpson,Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
Lisa Simpson,"No.... well, we used to have burping contests, but I outgrew it."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, well, if you want to get closer to him then maybe you should bridge the gap. I do it all the time. I pretend I'm interested in looking at power tools, going to those silly car chase movies, and... some things I'll tell you about when you're older. Do you understand?"
Lisa Simpson,I think so.
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,Whaaat?
Announcer,"Ho, look at that score. Moxy!"
Homer Simpson,Why did you do that?
Lisa Simpson,Wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
Homer Simpson,"Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."
Homer Simpson,Over.
Homer Simpson,Over... over... over...
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer."
Lisa Simpson,He said Denver just fumbled.
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"See you in Hell, soldier boy!"
Marge Simpson,Bart?
Bart Simpson,Yeah mom?
Marge Simpson,"I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'd love to. But to be honest, I don't need new clothes."
Marge Simpson,Oh really?
Marge Simpson,Hmm...
Bart Simpson,So even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It's not...
JIMMY,"Well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time."
Homer Simpson,Why didn't you say that before!
Bret,"Okay, Jimmy, you're off the hook. We've got Miami Cincinnati coming up. Any thoughts?"
JIMMY,"I certainly do, Brett. I hereby declare Miami to be Smooth Jimmy's ""Lock of the Week."""
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy."
Sportscaster,"In the Cincinnati - Miami game, I declare Cincinnati to be my ""Shoe-in of the Week""."
Homer Simpson,"Huh, they both make a good case."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"After evaluating millions of pieces of data in the blink of an eye, the Gambletron 2000 says the winner is... Cincinnati by two hundred points?! Why you worthless hunk of junk!"
Coach,You want some of this don't ya?
Homer Simpson,Yeah!
Coach,Well you need to know the winners. And I know the winners. So call me now!
Coach,Whoa! Five dollars for the first minute. Two dollars for each additional minute.
Coach,You have reached the Coach's hot...
Homer Simpson,Line...
Coach,line.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, lay it on me, coach."
Coach,In the game of Mi-a-mi...
Homer Simpson,Mm-hm.
Coach,...versus Cin-
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati...
Coach,cin-
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati.
Coach,nat-
Homer Simpson,Cincinnati.
Coach,ti...
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?"
Coach,We must consider many things. The wind...
Homer Simpson,"Doh, not the wind."
Coach,...is blowing out of the west...
Homer Simpson,Oh...
Coach,at five
Homer Simpson,... miles per hour.
Coach,knots...
Homer Simpson,"Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?"
Homer Simpson,"Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins."
Moe Szyslak,"Gotcha, fifty beans on Miami. Um, Homer, I got a call on the other line. Hello?"
,
Krusty the Clown,"Moe, it's me Mr. ""K."""
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, what'll it be?"
Krusty the Clown,Put me down for seven hundred dollars on the Rams.
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, and put Sideshow Mel down for two grand."
,
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'm tired. I wanna go home. Can't I just lie down for a minute?"
Marge Simpson,"Now Bart, I think you'd look very sharp in this shirt."
Bart Simpson,"Fine, get it. Lets go."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, no, you have to try it on."
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, and this one's fifty percent off."
Bart Simpson,"You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up."
Marge Simpson,"Well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. Ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... And these... Oh look! Little bow ties."
Marge Simpson,And don't make that face at me.
Bart Simpson,How'd ya know?
,
Football Announcer #2,Touchdown Dolphins!
Homer Simpson,"All right, Dolphins!"
Lisa Simpson,"All right, Dolphins!"
Homer Simpson,Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson,Whoo-hoo!
Homer Simpson,Fifty big ones!
Lisa Simpson,Fifty big ones?
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game."
Lisa Simpson,You mean you made a bet?
Homer Simpson,"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting."
Lisa Simpson,What could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
Homer Simpson,"Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?"
Lisa Simpson,Uh-huh.
Marge Simpson,See how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
Homer Simpson,And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things...
Lisa Simpson,So gambling makes a good thing even better.
Homer Simpson,"That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."

,
Guard #1,We've got a trouble maker in booth eight.
Guard #2,Forget him. There's a code red in booth three.
Guard #1,My God. Those aren't the socks she came in with.
Guard #2,Un-unn. Let's move.
,
Marge Simpson,Bart?
Bart Simpson,"In here, Mom. But don't open the--"
Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, you could use some new underwear too."
,
Lisa Simpson,"...three, two, one..."
Football Announcer #2,"And the final from Riverfront Stadium, Miami 24 -- Cincinnati 10."
Homer Simpson,YEAH!
Lisa Simpson,"Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars."
Homer Simpson,"You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible."
Lisa Simpson,"Really, where?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?"
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, dad."
Marge Simpson,Did you two have fun?
Homer Simpson,You bet.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we had fun too. Right now, Bart is modeling his new clothes for his friends."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"You gotta come out sometime, Simpson."
Lisa Simpson,"Goodnight, Dad. I had a really nice time today."
Homer Simpson,"Me too, honey."
Lisa Simpson,Can I watch football with you again next Sunday?
Homer Simpson,Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Point well taken. Uh, mom, could you loosen my blanket a little? Dad tucked me in too tight and it's cutting off the circulation in my arms and legs."
Player,This team is fired up! We came here to play!
Homer Simpson,All right!
Lisa Simpson,He'll lose.
Homer Simpson,What? Didn't you hear what he said?
Lisa Simpson,"Look at the fear in his eyes. Listen to the quiver in his voice. He's a little boy, lost in a game of men."
Homer Simpson,You think we should bet against them?
Lisa Simpson,I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
Homer Simpson,You got it.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York."
Football Announcer,"Start spreadin' the news, it's New York over Philadelphia, thirty-five to ten."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I hate to break the mood, but I'm getting nauseous."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- Seattle because they got something to prove -- and the Raiders because they always cheat."
Football Announcer,"And in an extremely suspicious play, the Raiders win."
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, the new sign is really working."
Librarian,"It's been a madhouse, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,Let's see... football... Football: homo-eroticism in... oddball Canadian rules... Phyllis George and...
,
Football Announcer,"Oh Doctor, what a finish! The final score -- Atlanta seventeen -- Houston thirteen. And the lowly Falcons are flyin' high. Who would have thunk it?"
Homer Simpson,"My daughter, that's who!"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, me!"
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift."
Lisa Simpson,"C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my little girl says the cutest things."
Lisa Simpson,"You know, dad, Sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week."
Homer Simpson,Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day.
,
Homer Simpson,"The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, ya lucky moron."
Moe Szyslak,"Here you go, Homer. A hundred and thirty-five dollars."
Homer Simpson,I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory.
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, shut up."
,
Marge Simpson,Look at these prices. We could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
Homer Simpson,Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I can't help wondering where you're getting the money from?"
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?"
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, I guess so."
Marco,"Hello, I'm Marco. I'll be your waiter."
Homer Simpson,"Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer."
Marco,"Never heard that one before. Uh, would you care to select the wine?"
Bart Simpson,I'll do the honors.
Bart Simpson,"No. No. No. No. My God, what passes for a wine list these days. Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop. Chop."
Marco,Charming lad.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, violin guy!"
Homer Simpson,"What's your favorite song, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,The Broken Neck Blues.
Homer Simpson,Play on.
,
Bret,"It is the play-offs, it's five below and there's one loyal fan wearing nothing but a g-string and the team colors painted on his body."
JIMMY,He doesn't look too happy.
Bret,"Well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. Still, that is a real fan."
Homer Simpson,"Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks."
Homer Simpson,You promised you wouldn't get mad!
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago."
Homer Simpson,"Good, good... You call Moe."
Lisa Simpson,"Moe, this is L.S. calling for H.S."
Moe Szyslak,"Just give me the bet, Lisa."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hundred and ten, a hundred and twenty... You lucky son-of-a..."
Barney Gumble,"Hey Homer, you wanna go bowling next Sunday?"
Homer Simpson,"Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?"
Barney Gumble,"Well, my ma's coming in from Norway, but... uh what the hell."
,
Ralph Wiggum,And when the doctor said I didn't have worms anymore -- that was the happiest day of my life.
Miss Hoover,"Thank you, Ralph. Very graphic. Lisa Simpson? Would you like to read your essay?"
Lisa Simpson,"The happiest day of my life was three Sundays ago. I was sitting on my daddy's knee when the Saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread."
Miss Hoover,Dear God!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh dad, you must've bought me every Malibu Stacey accessory there is."
Homer Simpson,Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.
Marge Simpson,"Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep's ""Versatility."""
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I know you're gonna like your present."
Box,Shut up. Shut up. Kiss my butt. Shut up. Go to Hell. Go to Hell.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, those are very thoughtful presents. But you have to tell me where you got the money from."
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad."
Marge Simpson,"I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't."
Homer Simpson,"All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Marge Simpson,I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
Marge Simpson,But gambling is illegal.
Homer Simpson,"Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I just don't know."
Homer Simpson,"Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted."
Homer Simpson,"Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
Lisa Simpson,"You know, dad, we've been watching a lot of TV lately. Maybe, the Sunday after the Super Bowl, we could hike up to the top of Mount Springfield. The fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney."
Lisa Simpson,What about Daddy-Daughter day?
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
Lisa Simpson,So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all.
Marge Simpson,You're a very selfish man.
Box,Go to hell! Go to hell!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, once again. Great present, Dad."
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,My third husband bought me this.
Lisa Simpson,Give me some chips for it.
Dealer,"Are you sure, ma'am?"
Lisa Simpson,"Don't tell me what to do, Sonny. I've been gambling since I was eight. And I've been hockin' jewelry since I was twelve. Now give me some chips!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Look around you, Malibu Stacey. All this was bought with dirty money. Your penthouse, your Alfa Romeo, your collagen injection clinic."
Lisa Simpson,"You're going back into the shoe-box. It may not be pretty, but dammit, it's honest."
Lisa Simpson,"I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories!"
Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Lisa Simpson,"So you've come to buy my forgiveness. Sorry, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, I did."
Homer Simpson,"Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I would like to see what all the fuss is about."
Homer Simpson,It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?
Lisa Simpson,Put me down.
Lisa Simpson,"Look dad, I'll tell you who's gonna win the Super Bowl if you want me to. But it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Lisa Simpson,I think Dallas is a mortal lock.
Homer Simpson,Dallas! Whoo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson,However...
Homer Simpson,"However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?"
Lisa Simpson,"However, I may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously I want you to lose. In which case, I'd bet the farm on Buffalo."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on..."""
Lisa Simpson,I don't know.
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"If I still love you, Dallas. If I don't, Buffalo."
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it."
Bret,We're live from Miami Florida home of Super Bowl Twenty-nine. Today we're gonna be seen by people in over one hundred fifty countries all over the world. Including our latest stolen affiliates overseas.

UGOLIN,Stupide.
Nutty Comedian,Whaa! I'm sorry Mrs. Wellenmelon.
Cesar,Formidable!

Bart Simpson,"Oh, this sucks. C'mon snipers. Where are you?"

Moe Szyslak,"Moe's Tavern, Home of the Super Sunday Brunch Spectacular."
Barney Gumble,Oh! Baloney. Bread!
Moe Szyslak,Gotcha ya down for forty bucks. Good luck Your Eminence.
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer, you can't take any more of my money. I'm, uh, outta the bookie business."
Barney Gumble,"But Moe, you've been taking bets all..."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Barney, how 'bout a free beer?"
Barney Gumble,Wow!
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'."
Moe Szyslak,What? Gimme that.
Barney Gumble,
Homer Simpson,"I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it."
Bret,"Well sir, we're two hours and forty-five minutes into the pre-game show and we've got ourselves a special guest. Actor Troy McClure, whose new sitcom is premiering tonight -- coincidentally enough, right after the game!"
Troy McClure,"Thanks, Bret. My new show's called ""Handle with Care"". I play Jack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. We're the original odd couple!"
Bret,What made you want to do a situation comedy?
Troy McClure,"Well, I fell in love with the script, Bret, and my recent trouble with the IRS sealed the deal."
Bret,"Could be another Drexel's Class. Ooh, looks like we're almost ready for the kickoff."
Football Announcer,"Dallas kicks -- oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. Buffalo's going to start with excellent field position."
Homer Simpson,Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!
Larry,Whatcha got riding on this game?
Homer Simpson,My daughter.
Larry,What a gambler.
Football Announcer,That was the score at the half. Buffalo fourteen: Dallas seven.
,
Football Announcer,It's time for the never tedious Super Bowl halftime show.
Alien,"People of Earth, we've come ten billion light years to bring you this halftime message of peace."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, who's winning?"
Bart Simpson,You hate dad is up by a touchdown.
,
Barflies,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yea!!
Duff Announcer,It's a touchdown for half-back Dan Beer-dorf! Duff Dry has won the Duff Bowl!
Moe Szyslak,They wanted it more.
Barney Gumble,"Hey Homer, didn't you say if Duff Dry wins, your daughter loves you?"
Homer Simpson,Not Duff Dry... Dallas.
Barney Gumble,"Okay, okay. They're both great teams."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Football Announcer,Touchdown Cowboys!
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're back in business."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, I'm glad some people could resist the lures of the big game."
Man,"Oh my God, I forgot the game!"
,
Football Announcer,"So, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. If Dallas scores here, happy fans'll be looting and turning over cars in the Lone Star state tonight. Here's the handoff."
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, please..."
Football Announcer,Touchdown! Stick a fork in this one. It is done. The Dallas Cowboys wins Super Bowl twenty-nine.
,
Bart Simpson,I guess you love dad.
Lisa Simpson,I suspected as much.
,
Homer Simpson,Yes! She loves me! She loves me!
Moe Szyslak,What are you so happy about Homer? You didn't win any money.
Homer Simpson,"Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Dad!"
Homer Simpson,It's beautiful.
Lisa Simpson,Isn't it though?
Homer Simpson,After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?

Carl Carlson,That's it?
Marge Simpson,"Now Maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want."
Maggie Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust... Double bologna for Homer...."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese..."
Marge Simpson,One at a time! One at a time!
Lisa Simpson,"Don't even bother with the raisins. I'm not gonna eat 'em... Double bologna! Double bologna!... I don't ask for much, just no pimento. Don't forget to make it double bologna 'cause I can hardly..."
Marge Simpson,That's enough!
Marge Simpson,"There you go, Lisa. No pimentos. Bart, your hat's where you left it, behind the toilet. Homer, I'll sew your pants but I'm out of bologna."
Bart Simpson,Thanks mom.
Lisa Simpson,Thanks mom.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, Homer's dry-cleaning -- I think that's everything."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'm running late as it is. Can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?"
Homer Simpson,Alley balls?
Marge Simpson,"Alright, don't whine. Just put it in my left hand."
Marge Simpson,Kids! Hurry up or you're going to miss your bus!
Lisa Simpson,No way.
Bart Simpson,Never happen.
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'll be damned."

Marge Simpson,Get out.

Marge Simpson,No. I mean a vacation by myself.
Homer Simpson,"What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!"

Marge Simpson,Homer! If Maggie really doesn't want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you.

Troy McClure,Feeling tense?
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
Troy McClure,Then just push nine on your phone. Then the pound sign. Then four-eight-three. We'll do the rest.
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Strained peas.
Homer Simpson,Let go!
Gregory,"Marge, it's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of that Mexican med school."

Marge Simpson,Hi Homie. I feel much better.
Homer Simpson,Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company.
Barney Gumble,"No problem. Well, well, if it isn't little Bart. Remember your Uncle Barney? Hey Homer, let me hold him."

Barney Gumble,"Whoa... someone smells stinky. Oh, it's me."

Lisa Simpson,Bart you really shouldn't be looking through other people's things. Find anything good?

Barney Gumble,"Don't worry, don't worry. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make you an omlette."
Homer Simpson,Just help me look!
Barney Gumble,Are you sure? I make 'em with two kinds of cheese.
Homer Simpson,C'mon!
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Homer. I think I've got her."
Barney Gumble,Come on!
Homer Simpson,Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off.
Barney Gumble,"The sooner I get her out, the sooner we can have omlettes."

Marge Simpson,"Well, good. I'm coming home, honey. You can pick me up at the train station in an hour. And bring the kids. Bye!"
Homer Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,"Please, don't jump. I know you're going through some tough times, but you have your whole life ahead of you!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It's not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn't life funny? One day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. Oh."
Chief Wiggum,You the man who reported the lost baby?
Homer Simpson,Yes.
CHIF WIGGUM,Can you describe her?
Homer Simpson,Uh... she's small... she's a girl...
Chief Wiggum,Bingo!
Homer Simpson,Oh Maggie!
Chief Wiggum,Not so fast! You're wanted on three counts of criminal neglect.

Seymour Skinner,"Now, boys and girls, let's welcome our special guest, Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King yo-yo company."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I think I speak for everyone in this bed when I say you have nothing to worry about. Now let's just try and get a little shut eye, okay?"
Teenager,"Hey, what gives?"
Dad,"You said you wanted to live in a world without zinc, Jimmy. Well, now your car has no battery."
Teenager,But I promised Betty I'd pick her up by six. I'd better give her a call.
,
Dad,"Sorry Jimmy. Without zinc for the rotary mechanism, there are no telephones."
Teenager,"Dear God, what have I done?"
Dad,"Think again, Jimmy. You see, the firing pin in your gun was made of -- yup, zinc."
Teenager,Come back zinc! Come back...
Teenager,"Come back... zinc. Come back... zinc. Zinc! Zinc! What? Oh, it was all a dream. Thank goodness I still live in a world of telephones... car batteries... hand guns..."
Teenager,And many things made of zinc.
Bart Simpson,"Gross, he's picking his nose!"
Edna Krabappel,"If anyone wants to learn more about zinc, they're welcome to stay..."

Lisa Simpson,She's beautiful!
Ted,Zero Gravity!
Ted,The Cobra!
Bart Simpson,Those guys must be millionaires!
Nelson Muntz,I bet they get all kinds of girls!
Miss Hoover,I question the educational value of this assembly.
Edna Krabappel,"Hey, it'll be one of their few pleasant memories when they're pumpin' gas for a living."
Sound-alikes,THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS! AGE OF AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS! AQUARIUS!
Kids,
Mister Amazing,"Now, for our next stunt, what do you say we get your Principal up here!"
Seymour Skinner,No. Mmm... careful now...ooh... gee that one grazed my ear...
Mister Amazing,Don't move. You could really get hurt.
Seymour Skinner,Oh.
Bart Simpson,How much do those yo-yos cost?

Chuck,That's your trick?
Nelson Muntz,No. Here's my trick!
Bart Simpson,Thank you. Thank you.

Homer Simpson,Marge. Come here.
Homer Simpson,Can you believe it? Pretty soon I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.
Marge Simpson,What? Name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.
Homer Simpson,
,
Edna Krabappel,"After two months at sea, the Pilgrims were running out of food and water... Yes Nelson?"
Nelson Muntz,Did they have any yo-yos?
Edna Krabappel,"No, they did not have yo-yos. When they landed at Plymouth rock they were greeted by the friendly Wampanoag Indians...."
Milhouse Van Houten,Did the Indians have yo-yos?
Edna Krabappel,"No, they did not have yo-yos. That's it. I am sick and tired of talking about yo-yos. From now on I will not accept any book reports, science projects, dioramas, or anything else on yo-yos or yo-yo related topics. Am I making myself clear?"
Bart Simpson,Yo.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, got any new tricks for us today?"
Bart Simpson,Just one. A little something I call Plucking the Pickle.
Bart Simpson,"I build up a little steam, and..."
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Don't worry about your wee fish, Lass. They're going to a better place."
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, that's one month's detention."
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, we're all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles. But life goes on. So, if I could just have my yo-yo back..."
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, if I were you, and you were me, would you give back the yo-yo?"
Bart Simpson,Here you go... Just kidding. Here you go... Just kidding.
Edna Krabappel,"Well, would you?"
Bart Simpson,Absolutely.
Edna Krabappel,

Jasper Beardly,"What's eatin' you, woman? Your personal ad said you wanted a man. Well, you got yourself a humdinger."
Edna Krabappel,I don't know. I guess I expected something different from your photo.
Jasper Beardly,Don't let my age fool you. Just cause there's a little snow on the roof... I forget how the rest of that goes.
,
Lisa Simpson,Is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?
Bart Simpson,"One months detention... She'll pay for this. Yup, there's your problem... someone jammed a Malibu Stacy head down here."
Miss Hoover,"Edna, happy hour in the Teacher's Lounge."
Edna Krabappel,Just a sec.
Bart Simpson,"Huh. One plus one equals two? Recently divorced fourth-grade teacher wishes to meet man age 18-60. Object: save me. Write Edna K, Box 402."
Bart Simpson,Hmmm.
Bart Simpson,"Dear Edna, I've never answered a personal ad before, but I found yours irresistible. My name is..."

Romantic Lover Voice,"...Woodrow. I like holding hands and dinner by candle light. And oh, yes, I really hate yo-yos."
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, Woodrow."
,
Marge Simpson,Maybe we should let the dog in?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, dogs love the outdoors."
Marge Simpson,I think he needs a dog house.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
Marge Simpson,I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
Marge Simpson,I am not!
Homer Simpson,"Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I don't know..."
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it.
Homer Simpson,"This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see."
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"How was detention today, dear?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, not bad. I'm starting to get the hang of the floor waxer."
Bart Simpson,Yes!
Edna Krabappel,"""Dear Woodrow, I must admit I'm intrigued. You're not like the other men I've met."""
Bart Simpson,Yeah. I'm the 28th President of the United States.
Lisa Simpson,Mmm! Could it be there's a special someone you're not telling me about?
Bart Simpson,"Oh, please."
Edna Krabappel,"""But I've had some bad experiences with these ads. So, I'd like to learn more about you. Please write back soon. Here's a photo that'll get your pencil moving."""
Bart Simpson,You've got a date with a xerox machine.

Ned Flanders,"Fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. Well sir, I gave him three quarters by mistake. Took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
Maude Flanders,"Todd, would you like some mixed vegetables?"
Todd Flanders,Hell no!
Maude Flanders,What did you say?
Todd Flanders,I said I don't want any damn vegetables.
Ned Flanders,"All right, that's it, young man. No Bible stories for you tonight."
Maude Flanders,Weren't you a little hard on him?
Ned Flanders,"Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me."
,
Helen Lovejoy,Ned Flanders is on the phone.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"If this is about that stupid quarter again -- Hello, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy, but I'm kind of in a tizzy. Our son Todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, you know kids and vegetables. What was it, asparagus?"
Ned Flanders,"No Reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, oh right, yeah. Kids usually pick these things up from someplace. Find out who's doing it and... uh, direct them to the Bible."
Ned Flanders,Where in the Bible?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Uh... page nine-hundred.
Ned Flanders,But Reverend...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Damn Flanders.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis, a moment of your time."
Lisa Simpson,Yeah?
Bart Simpson,Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my A material. What should I say?
Lisa Simpson,Is it Terri?
Lisa Simpson,Is it that exchange student Mx!pa?
Bart Simpson,No! It's not for me. It's homework.
Lisa Simpson,"Sure it is. Hey Bart, let's do some homework."
,
Southern Private,"Golly, Sergeant Carter, I can't fix your jeep. But maybe this will make it up to you. Galveston, oh Galveston..."
Ned Flanders,Is this all he watches?
Maude Flanders,"Oh, he used to watch ""Davy and Goliath,"" but he thought the idea of a talking dog was blasphemous."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey Mom, did you save the love letters Dad sent you?"
Marge Simpson,Of course I saved them.
Marge Simpson,"Although actually there's only one. And it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited."
Homer Simpson,"""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."""
Bart Simpson,"Wow, a side of dad I've never seen."
,
Edna Krabappel,
Bart Simpson,"Penny for your thoughts, Mrs. K."
Edna Krabappel,"I was just thinking... oh, you wouldn't be interested."
Bart Simpson,Try me. Sometimes it helps to talk.
Edna Krabappel,"Well, I was just wishing I could meet a man who... likes the way I look first thing in the morning... laughs at my jokes..."
Bart Simpson,Uh-huh.
Edna Krabappel,...can fix my car...
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah.

Bart Simpson,Dear Edna: Your photo took my breath away.

Ned Flanders,

Homer Simpson,
Ned Flanders,Homer?
Homer Simpson,"What is it, Flanders?"
Ned Flanders,I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
Homer Simpson,"Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?"
Ned Flanders,"No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you talking about?
Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
Homer Simpson,"Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache."
Ned Flanders,What's wrong with my moustache?
Homer Simpson,Makes you look like you've got something to hide.
Ned Flanders,What?
Homer Simpson,People are talking... lots of people.
Ned Flanders,"Okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. I'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
Homer Simpson,Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead.
Announcer,"We now return to ""Two for Tunsia"" on Colorization Theater."
Charles Boyer,"Ah, my love... A million poets could try for a million years and still describe but three-eighths of your beauty."
Bart Simpson,"Ohhh, slow down, Frenchy! This stuff is gold."

Miss Hoover,"Wow, ""a million poets working for a million years""... You're so lucky. When are you gonna meet him?"
Edna Krabappel,"First, I asked him to send a photo."
Miss Hoover,Uh... huh.
Edna Krabappel,"If he's got everything where it should be, I'm reelin' him in."

Bart Simpson,"Strap on your skates Gordie, you're going in."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing."
Marge Simpson,"Well, you know, maybe he's right."
Homer Simpson,"Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?"
Marge Simpson,"Actually, Homer, you brought up Ned Flanders. I never said a word --"
Homer Simpson,"Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now."
Marge Simpson,"No, you're not. When my father got out of the Navy, he used to curse a blue streak. It almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. So, my mom put a Swear Jar in the kitchen. Every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. What do you think?"
Homer Simpson,"Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar."
Homer Simpson,Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?
Marge Simpson,"Yes, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What if I catch on fire?
Marge Simpson,"No, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What if I see something really weird in the sky?
Marge Simpson,"Yes, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What about when we snuggle?
Marge Simpson,Uh... that's okay.

Edna Krabappel,"""Dear Woodrow, it's time for us to meet. Why don't we go out to dinner and afterward we can go to my apartment for some home cookin'."""

Bart Simpson,"Yes, ma'am."

Romantic Lover Voice,"""Join me at the Gilded Truffle this Saturday at eight. Perhaps later we will smooch up a storm. Sexily yours, Woody."""

,
Bart Simpson,I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Bart Simpson,"Homer, that was a twenty."
Homer Simpson,God --
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, you son-of-a."
Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, Ya know, I owe you one, buddy. No sooner had I shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
Ned Flanders,"Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
Homer Simpson,You dirty bas...
Homer Simpson,"What do ya think, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,How's the dog supposed to get in?
Homer Simpson,"Well, he just goes... Ohhh"
,
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, Woodrow. How could you stand me up?"
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. K, whoever this guy is, you don't need him. There are plenty of good men around."
Edna Krabappel,Name one.
Bart Simpson,What's wrong with Principal Skinner?
Edna Krabappel,"Seymour? Huh, let's just say his mommy won't let him out to play."
Bart Simpson,What about Coach Fortner?
Edna Krabappel,"Glug, glug, glug, glug..."
Bart Simpson,Wow! What about Groundskeeper Willie?
Edna Krabappel,"I'm not even gonna tell you what that guy's into. Bart, you're the closest thing to a man in my life. And that's so depressing, I think I'm gonna cry."
Bart Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh fudge, that's broken."
Homer Simpson,"Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse."
Homer Simpson,Where'd you get the money?
Marge Simpson,"There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise."
Homer Simpson,Maggie. Oh. Cute.
Marge Simpson,"No, behind her."
Homer Simpson,Beer! How did you know?
Marge Simpson,Where's Maggie? Where's Maggie?
Marge Simpson,There's Maggie!
Bart Simpson,"Mom, this is a little ahead of schedule, but I need help with my love life."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart."
Lisa Simpson,"I knew it. All right, Bart, who's your girlfriend?"
Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night."
Marge Simpson,"Homer! Bart, you did a very cruel thing."
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth."
Marge Simpson,"No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe we should write her another letter. One that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
Homer Simpson,Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty.
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."""
Marge Simpson,We'll all help.
Lisa Simpson,"""Though I'll be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."""
Bart Simpson,"That sucks. How 'bout, ""Crocodiles bit off my face."""
Marge Simpson,"That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face."
Homer Simpson,"I may hold you to that, Marge."
Lisa Simpson,"""Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor."""
Bart Simpson,"""I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live."""
Homer Simpson,Three simple words. I am gay.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in."
Lisa Simpson,"""And any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna!"""
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's very good, Lisa."
Homer Simpson,P.S. -- I am gay.
Marge Simpson,How shall we end it?
Homer Simpson,"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"""
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's sweet."
Bart Simpson,"Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper."
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
,
,
Edna Krabappel,Wait! Wait!
,
Romantic Lover Voice,"""Dearest Edna, I must leave you. Why I cannot say. Where? You cannot know. How I will get there, I haven't decided yet. But one thing I can tell you, any time I hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... Edna."""

Homer Simpson,Don't tell me how to eat donuts --
Carl Carlson,"Hey, Homer's choking again."
Lenny Leonard,Hmm. Isn't there a first aid chart around here somewhere?
Carl Carlson,Somebody scare him.
Charlie,That's for hiccups.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, look at this."
Lenny Leonard,Softball starts this week.
Homer Simpson,Softball?
Homer Simpson,Who's next?
Homer Simpson,What's the matter with you guys?
Lenny Leonard,"Homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight."
Homer Simpson,"Look, I know it wasn't our best season."
Lenny Leonard,"Actually, it was."
Homer Simpson,"Well, this year's gonna be different."
Carl Carlson,Oh yeah. What makes you so damn sure?
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I have a secret weapon.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, he's been holding' out on us."
Charlie,A secret weapon? I wonder what it could be.
,
Homer Simpson,"Come here boy, I want to show you something."
Bart Simpson,What's that? A home-made bat?
Homer Simpson,"It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house..."
Homer Simpson,"Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find."
Homer Simpson,"Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of."
Homer Simpson,I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, come to bed."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, go back to the garage."
Homer Simpson,And here it is.
Bart Simpson,Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that?
Homer Simpson,Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
Bart Simpson,
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hit one here, Charlie."
Umpire,"Okay, let's go over the ground rules. You can't leave first until you chug a beer. Any man scoring has to chug a beer. You have to chug a beer at the top of all odd numbered innings. Oh, and the fourth inning is the beer inning."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, we know how to play softball."
Umpire,Play ball!
Dispatcher,Attention all units! Attention all units! Armored car being robbed at...
Chief Wiggum,Turn off that damn radio!
Marge Simpson,And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And he does. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Mom, why don't you let me call the game."
Marge Simpson,That's all right dear. I can do it.
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, stop that!"
Carl Carlson,"Okay, Homer, bases loaded and you're up. Where's that secret weapon?"
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, boys. My magic bat."
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, I got a magic bat, too."
Carl Carlson,And I got an enchanted jock strap.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, just watch."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoooooo!
Homer Simpson,Ha ha. Cops can't win!
Chief Wiggum,Get his license and registration.
Eddie,"Right, Chief."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, Dad."
Bart Simpson,"Homer, can I get you a beer?"
Lisa Simpson,"No, I want to get him a beer."
Homer Simpson,"Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Such a mighty wallop.
Carl Carlson,"Hey, I got my magic bat off a piano."
Charlie,My sister let me use her wooden leg.

Waylon Smithers,"Good news, sir! The plant's softball team has won again. If we beat Shelbyville next week we capture the pennant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Did you hear that, Ari? My boys need only to thump your tub and the title is ours."
ARI,Ha!! My gladiators from my power plant will crush your team like nine flabby grapes.
C. Montgomery Burns,I disagree.
ARI,Would you care to bet a million dollars on that?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting?"
ARI,What? A million dollars isn't interesting to you?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, did you say a million? I'm... I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine."
C. Montgomery Burns,Um-hm.

C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've been thinking. Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?"
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Let me rephrase that. Is it wrong if I cheat in order to win a million dollar bet?
Waylon Smithers,"No, sir! Whom should I kill?"
Homer Simpson,"I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, Smithers. I've decided to bring in a few ringers. Professional baseballers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"We'll give them token jobs at the plant and have them play on our softball team. Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Mordecai ""Three Finger"" Brown..."
Waylon Smithers,Uh... sir...
C. Montgomery Burns,"What is it, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"I'm afraid... all those players have retired and... uh... passed on. In fact, your right fielder has been dead for a hundred and thirty years."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damnation! All right, find me some good players. Living players! Scour the professional ranks. The American League. The National League. The Negro Leagues."
Waylon Smithers,"I'm on my way, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and Smithers... You have twenty-four hours."
,
Jose Canseco,"I get $50,000 to play one game?"
Waylon Smithers,"That's right, Mr. Canseco."
Jose Canseco,"Well, it's a pay cut. But what the hey, it sounds like fun."
,
Waylon Smithers,Ow.
Mike Scioscia,"Hey, sorry! I thought you were a deer."
Waylon Smithers,"That's okay, happens all the time. Are you Mike Scioscia?"
Mike Scioscia,That's me.
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, how do you like working for the Dodgers?"
Mike Scioscia,"Well, it's okay. But sometimes I wish I had something a little more blue collar. You know, with big machines and cool dials and stuff, like an oil refinery or a hydro-electric plant."
Waylon Smithers,We should talk.
,
Tour Guide,"And this is Elvis' rec room. When the King wasn't rehearsing or exercising, he liked to unwind by watching up to three TVs at once."
Ozzie Smith,"Man, oh, man, what a lifestyle."
Waylon Smithers,"Excuse me, are you Ozzie Smith?"
Ozzie Smith,Yes.
Waylon Smithers,I have a proposition for you...
,
Waylon Smithers,"Hello, are you Don Mattingly?"
Don Mattingly,"Yes, yes I am. Come in. Come in. Can I get you something? What's your name?"
,
Waylon Smithers,How would you like to be a ringer on a small town company softball team?
Steve Sax,Would I!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,And now I'd like to introduce the new members of our happy power plant family. Our new security guard... Roger Clemens...
Roger Clemens,Hello.
C. Montgomery Burns,"our new janitor, Wade Boggs..."
Wade Boggs,How you doin'?
C. Montgomery Burns,"our new lunchroom cashier... Ken Griffey, Jr...."
KEN GRIFFEY JR.,"Hey, what's up guys?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Our new, well uh, we'll make up jobs for these fellows later... Please say hello to Steve Sax, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, Ozzie Smith, Mike Scioscia, and Jose Canseco."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, by the way, you new fellows, there's a sign up sheet for the company softball team on the bulletin board over there. Eh, just in case you wish to play."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Burns. With them on the team, you won't need us!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well... duh. You, Scioscia, sign up..."
Mike Scioscia,"Thanks just the same, but I'm here to run the solid contaminant encapsulator."
C. Montgomery Burns,One more outburst like that and I'll send you back to the big leagues!
Homer Simpson,You're Darryl Strawberry.
Darryl Strawberry,Yes.
Homer Simpson,You play right field.
Darryl Strawberry,Yes.
Homer Simpson,I play right field too.
Darryl Strawberry,So?
Homer Simpson,"Well, are you better than me?"
Darryl Strawberry,"Well, I've never met you, but... yes."
,
Homer Simpson,It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench.
Marge Simpson,You hit so many home runs this year. What makes you think this Darryl Strawberry character is better than you?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do."
Bart Simpson,You make me sick Homer. You're the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.
Homer Simpson,"Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
Bart Simpson,"Gotcha. Can't win, don't try."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"As your new manager, I want to say this up front. No one is assured a spot in the starting line-up. I don't care if your name is Steve Sax, Darryl Strawberry, or... Smithers, what's one of the bad players' names?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Or Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Secondly, instead of beer, from now on you will all be drinking this!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a brain and nerve tonic. Rich in proteids and electromagnetic juices. It promotes robust health. Of course, it has been known to cause gigantism, but only in rare cases. Try some."
KEN GRIFFEY JR.,Wow! It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. Now, let's begin our training, shall we? Smithers -- the medicine balls."
Waylon Smithers,"What are you going to do with your million dollars, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I don't know. Throw it on the pile, I suppose."
Hypnotist,You are all very good players.
ALL THE PLAYERS,We are all very good players.
Hypnotist,You will beat Shelbyville.
ALL THE PLAYERS,We will beat Shelbyville.
Hypnotist,You will give one hundred and ten percent.
ALL THE PLAYERS,That's impossible no one can give more than one hundred percent. By definition that is the most any one can give.
Homer Simpson,I got it! I got it!
Darryl Strawberry,Yes!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I called for that!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Put a lid on it, Simpson. There's no ""I"" in ""team""."
Darryl Strawberry,"Some of these guys have a bad attitude, skip."
C. Montgomery Burns,"They sure do, Strawberry."
,
Roger Clemens,"Wait a minute, are you Ken Griffey Jr.?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Carl Carlson,"Hey Scioscia, I don't get it. You're a ringer but you're here every night, in the core, bustin' your butt haulin' radioactive waste."
Mike Scioscia,"Well Carl, it's such a relief from the pressures of playing big league ball. I mean, there you make any kind of mistake and boom, the press is all over you."
Mike Scioscia,Uh-oh.
Carl Carlson,"Ah, don't worry about it."
Mike Scioscia,"Oh man, is this ever sweet."
,
KEN GRIFFEY JR.,Pick me! Pick me!
Ralph Wiggum,I pick Ken Griffey Jr.
Bart Simpson,"Aw geez... okay, I'll take Milhouse."
Ralph Wiggum,"Hey, Mr. Boggs! Will you be on my team?"
Wade Boggs,You got yourself a player.
Bart Simpson,"Damn! All right, I'll take Lewis."
Ralph Wiggum,I'll take Jose Canseco.
Bart Simpson,

C. Montgomery Burns,Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns!
Don Mattingly,What sideburns?
C. Montgomery Burns,"You heard me, hippy."
C. Montgomery Burns,Mattingly! Get rid of those sideburns.
Don Mattingly,What sideburns?
C. Montgomery Burns,"You heard me, hippie."
Homer Simpson,"These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat."""
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Take a knee boys.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tomorrow is the biggest day of your lives. The Shelbyville game. So lights out at seven-thirty and abstain from coffee, tea, and cola drinks. Make no mistake, they pack a wallop."
Darryl Strawberry,"Sure do, Skip."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. Now, before I post the starting line-up I want to assure those of you whose names are not on the list, that I'm very disappointed in you. Something was lacking, let's call it heart."
Darryl Strawberry,"No hustle either, Skip."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right, Darryl."
Lenny Leonard,"Aw, nuts!"
Homer Simpson,"Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?"
Roger Clemens,You sure did.
Roger Clemens,"Sorry, I didn't mean to get your hopes up."
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet. Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that's possible. Seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance. But nine misfortunes... I'd like to see that."

Steve Sax,What a nice little town. Maybe I'll buy a home here when I retire.
Steve Sax,"What seems to be the problem, officers?"
Eddie,"That's enough out of you, smart guy."
Lou,Reach for your license... slowly.
Eddie,"Well well, Steve Sax from New York City."
Lou,"I heard some guy got killed in New York City, and they never solved the case. But you wouldn't know anything about that -- now would you Steve?"
Steve Sax,But there's hundreds of unsolved murders in New York City.
Lou,"You don't know when to keep your mouth shut, do you Saxy boy?"

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Uh, Mike, try to lift your arm."
Mike Scioscia,Can't... lift... arm... or... speak... at... normal... rate.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, I'm afraid you have a case of acute radiation poisoning, Mr. Scioscia."
Mike Scioscia,Will... I... be... able... to... play... softball... tomorrow?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"No, by tomorrow you'll barely be able to breathe."
Mike Scioscia,Oh... man.
Nurse,"Dr. Hibbert, Ken Griffey, Jr. needs to see you immediately. We think it's an overdose of nerve tonic."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Good Lord! Gigantism!

Ozzie Smith,How long does it take to see this thing? I'm kind of in a hurry.

Ozzie Smith,Wow! One please.
Ticket Taker,
,
Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going?
Lisa Simpson,To the game.
Homer Simpson,"No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
Bart Simpson,"We've seen it, dad."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, for the last time, get rid of those sideburns!"
Don Mattingly,"Look, Mr. Burns. I don't know what you think sideburns are, but..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Don't argue with me! Just get rid of them.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, it's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, Mike Socioscia may not live through the night. Steve Sax is looking at six consecutive life sentences. And Ozzie Smith seems to have vanished off the face of the earth."
C. Montgomery Burns,What about Conseco?
,
Woman,The dryer goes on the right.
JOSE CONSECO,Yes ma'am.
C. Montgomery Burns,What about Clemens?
Waylon Smithers,Sir... he's in no condition to play.
Roger Clemens,"Brock, bock, bock, bock. Brock, bock, bock, bock."
C. Montgomery Burns,That damn hypnotist!
C. Montgomery Burns,"You, look what you've done! My starting pitcher thinks he's a chicken! Make no mistake, I'm going to report this to the American Hypnotical Association."
Hypnotist,But I did a good job... a gooood job.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh well, I guess it's not your fault... you did a good job."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, I thought I told you to trim those sideburns. Go home! You're off the team! For good!"
Don Mattingly,Fine. I still like him better than Steinbrenner.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you're all I've got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not so fast, Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,The man who plays your position is still here. Hit the pine.
Lisa Simpson,You stink Strawberry. We want Home-run Homer!
Bart Simpson,"Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl."
Lisa Simpson,"Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl."
Marge Simpson,"Children, that's not very nice."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, they're professional athletes. They're used to this sort of thing. It rolls right off their backs."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Monty, it's up to you managerial skills. What to do. Smithers, massage my brain."
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You! Strawberry, hit a home run."
Darryl Strawberry,"Okay, Skip!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I told him to do that.
Waylon Smithers,"Brilliant strategy, sir."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, dear."
Marge Simpson,"Children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. Kids?"
Bart Simpson,"We'll tell ya, mom."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, tie game. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, Strawberry coming up..."
Homer Simpson,"They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
C. Montgomery Burns,Wait! You! Strawberry! Good effort today. Take a lap and hit the showers. I'm putting in a right-handed batter to hit for you.
Waylon Smithers,What?
Darryl Strawberry,You're pinch-hitting for me?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. You see, you're a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ballgames."
Darryl Strawberry,But I've got nine home runs today.
C. Montgomery Burns,You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry.
Homer Simpson,I am? Whoo-hoo!
Carl Carlson,"Atta boy, Homer."
Lenny Leonard,You can do it.
Roger Clemens,"Brock, bock, bock, bock, bock!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Simpson, let's go over the signals."
C. Montgomery Burns,If I tug the bill of my cap like so...
Homer Simpson,Yes.
C. Montgomery Burns,...it means the signal is a fake.
Homer Simpson,Uh uh.
C. Montgomery Burns,"However, I can take that off by dusting my hands thusly."
Homer Simpson,Got it.
C. Montgomery Burns,"If I want you to bunt, I will touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Got that Simpson?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir!"
P.A. Announcer,"Now batting for Darryl Strawberry, Homer Simpson."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Marge Simpson,"Oh, dear."
Lisa Simpson,"No mom, it counts as a hit. Dad just won the game."
Marge Simpson,"Ohh, well, I guess he'll be happy when he comes to."

Homer Simpson,"No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm gonna be a famous jazz musician. I've got it all figured out. I'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the French.

Bart Simpson,Really?
Seymour Skinner,"I saw some awful things in 'Nam, but you really have to wonder at the mentality that would desecrate a helpless puma. I never thought I'd say this, but the no-goodniks rule this school!"

Seymour Skinner,"I have never seen a good student take such a slide. Lisa, what are you rebelling against?"
Lisa Simpson,Whattaya got?
,
Donna,"And she goes, ""Lisa told Hoover to shove it"" and I'm like, ""No way!"" And she's like, ""Fraid so,"" and I'm all, ""Whooah!"", and she's like..."
Tammy,"Hey, Lisa, man. I'm like, so impressed. When I was in second grade, I was all ""Hi, there, I'm so good."" Want a smoke?"
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, I'll smoke it in class."
Donna,Whoa.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, you're doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school you'd just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere."
Bart Simpson,"Every day is a new fight, sir."
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, the school is a police state. Students are afraid to sneeze. And I have you to thank. Come with me."
,
Bart Simpson,Madre de Dios! The legends were true!
Seymour Skinner,"Yes Bart, whenever a teacher confiscates something it ends up here. Salacious halter-tops, complete collections of Mad, Cracked and the occasional issue of Crazy, and this fake plastic derriere."
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,"Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice."
Bart Simpson,All-riight!
Seymour Skinner,"Ooo, now, you be careful with that crossbow."
Bart Simpson,I will.
Bart Simpson,"Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelson's mother. And this is Nelson's English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the d's."
Seymour Skinner,Forgery. So he didn't have leprosy.
,
Former Teacher,This is a great day for me. I thought I could never teach again.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Things have changed. There will be no mockery of your name, Mr. Glasscock."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Lewis, watch this."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Ow! Bart, do something."
Bart Simpson,"Let's go, Milhouse."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sure, we have order. But at what price!"
,
Miss Hoover,"Now let's correct our homework exercises. Lisa, what nineteenth century figure was nicknamed ""Old Hickory""?"
Lisa Simpson,I don't know. You?
Miss Hoover,"Lisa, if you'd bothered to do the assignment you'd know the answer is..."
Miss Hoover,"The Battle of New Orleans. I mean, Andrew Jackson."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, you're earning your eighteen grand a year."
Lisa Simpson,Stupid Hoover... thinks she's so smart.
Lisa Simpson,She wouldn't be so smart without her Teacher's edition.
Lisa Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Yeah!
Seymour Skinner,"Ladies and gentlemen, the unthinkable has happened. Some sick, twisted individual has stolen every teacher's edition in this school."
Teacher #1,What'll we do?
Edna Krabappel,Declare a snowday!
Teacher #2,Does anyone know the multiplication table?
Seymour Skinner,"Please, please, don't panic! They can smell fear."
Edna Krabappel,"Children, I know this is highly irregular, but for the rest of the uh, day Martin will be teaching this class."
Martin Prince,I will? But I wouldn't know where to begin.
Edna Krabappel,"Just do it, Brainiac."
Hippie Teacher,Have I ever told you kids about the sixties?
Miss Hoover,I've... got... to get... out... of... here!
Miss Hoover,Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean. Calm blue ocean.
,
Former Teacher,I'm leaving the profession again.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh now Mr. Glasscock, please reconsider."
Former Teacher,Hunh-uh.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, the police haven't had any luck finding the teachers' editions."
,
Chief Wiggum,The dogs have picked up the scent of books.
Chief Wiggum,Send in the battering ram.
Eddie,Here we go!
Seymour Skinner,We're going to have to re-order every book.
Bart Simpson,"Seymour, I'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. All we have to do is search every locker."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Bart, I'm not sure random locker searches are permitted by the Supreme Court..."
Bart Simpson,"Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately?"
Seymour Skinner,Let's move.
,
Seymour Skinner,Hmm...
Seymour Skinner,Bah.
,
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,That's right. It was I.
Bart Simpson,"Lis, why did you do it?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but even I had my limits. You're looking at expulsion for this."
Lisa Simpson,I know. I know.
Seymour Skinner,The books!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, you've just saved the school one hundred and twenty dollars. Who's behind this monstrous crime?"
Bart Simpson,I am.
Lisa Simpson,
,
Seymour Skinner,"I've been so blind. In retrospect, the signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry if I betrayed your trust, Principal Sucker."
Seymour Skinner,"D'oh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, I've decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention."
Bart Simpson,Four hundred days. I can do that standing on my head.
Seymour Skinner,"All right, five hundred days."
Bart Simpson,"Oooh, big man."
Seymour Skinner,Six hundred days.
Bart Simpson,Maybe I'll just shut my big mouth.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Let's go, Simpson."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, why'd you take the blame?"
Bart Simpson,"'Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart."
,
Bart Simpson,"Soundin' good, Lis!"
Employee,I don't need your crummy job Mr. Employer! I won the lottery!
Employer,"Well, who needs employees? I won the lottery too!"
Window Washers,We both won the lottery!
Window Washers,"Why don't you win the lottery, too?"
Announcer,The State Lottery. Where everybody wins. Actual odds of winning -- one in three hundred eighty million.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Pfft, the lottery. Exploiter of the poor and ignorant."
Barney Gumble,"You know, I heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars."
Homer Simpson,One hundred and thirty million dollars!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, yes, here's your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Strap on your bullet proof vest, Sanjay. It's time for another bank run."
Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon,"All right, but if I don't make it, promise you won't sleep with my wife."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I promise nothing.
,
Homer Simpson,You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!
Marge Simpson,But we never ever...
Homer Simpson,"I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money..."
Marge Simpson,I buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. We each play our birthday. And that's enough excitement for me.
Homer Simpson,"You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we're on a tight budget here. Promise me you won't get carried away."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, down in front."
Kent Brockman,The whole state is suddenly in the grip of lottery fever. And Springfield is no exception.
,
Kent Brockman,"In fact, every copy of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" has been checked out from the Springfield Public Library."
,
Kent Brockman,"Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad."
,
Kent Brockman,"But there's already one big winner. Our state's school system, which gets fully half the profits from the lottery."
Marge Simpson,You can still win some money if you have five out of six.
Homer Simpson,Whoo-hoo!
Seymour Skinner,Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.
Seymour Skinner,"And a state of the art detention hall, where children are held in place with magnets."
Teacher #1,Magnets. Always with the magnets.
,
Homer Simpson,I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one."
Homer Simpson,"Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
Bart Simpson,Put it in the bank.
Lisa Simpson,Give it to the poor.
Homer Simpson,What do kids know about spending money?
Bart Simpson,"What are you gonna do, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,Hmm...
Lenny Leonard,"Hey Homer, what'd you do? Get a haircut or something?"
Homer Simpson,"Look closer, Lenny!"
Lenny Leonard,Oh I know what it is. You're the biggest man in the world now. And you're covered in gold.
Homer Simpson,Fourteen carat gold!
,
Homer Simpson,"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now."
C. Montgomery Burns,All hail king Homer!
,
,
Kent Brockman,We now take you to the drawing live -- I hope you've got your tickets. I've got mine.
,
Lou,"They're about to start, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,"No, you've got the wrong number. This is nine one two."
,
Krusty the Clown,"We'll be with you in a minute, kids. This could be our ticket outta here, Mel."
,
Lottery Announcer,I will now draw the first winning number.
,
Homer Simpson,I've got so many tickets I can't lose!
Lottery Announcer,The first number is... seventeen.
Lottery Announcer,And the second number is... three.
Homer Simpson,"Receipts, ugh."
Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win."
Homer Simpson,"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."""
Lottery Announcer,And the final number is... forty-nine.
Kent Brockman,Thirty-eight... forty-nine... Ohmigod! I won! I won!
Kent Brockman,"Recapping our day's top story -- the winner of today's state lottery is me, Kent Brockman! Can we get a shot of me?"
Kent Brockman,There you go.
Kent Brockman,In other news... uh... a tragic mix-up today in Cleveland... many people killed... uh... Goodbye.
Marge Simpson,"Oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, the dog's dead."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, he's not dead!"
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
Lisa Simpson,It's not fair to toy with people's emotions like that.
Grampa Simpson,He is dead! I'll get a shovel.
Marge Simpson,"Well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, sure! The old man's off his rocker. If Grampa says he's dead he must be alive."
Lisa Simpson,He is alive. He's wagging his tail.
Grampa Simpson,That don't mean nothin'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home.
,
,
Vet,Clear! Ugh... Clear!
Nurse,Doctor... he's gone.
Vet,This is the part of the job I hate.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you did the best you could."
Vet,"I love animals. I spend my life saving them and they can't thank me. Well... the parrots can -- but, anyway let's see what's wrong with this little fella."
Vet,I'm afraid that your dog has a twisted stomach. He needs an operation to correct it or he'll die.
,
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, how much will it cost?"
Vet,Seven hundred and fifty dollars.
Marge Simpson,Oh dear!
Vet,This is never an easy decision. It's an awful lot of money.
Homer Simpson,Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over.
Bart Simpson,Talk what over? What's there to talk about?
Bart Simpson,What are we going to talk over?
Krusty the Clown,Mr. Teeny needs a refill of his nicotine gum.
,
Bart Simpson,I can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. When's the dog going to get his operation?
Homer Simpson,"Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven."
,
Homer Simpson,"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and..."
Bart Simpson,Is there a Doggie Hell?
Homer Simpson,Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
Bart Simpson,Who's in there?
Homer Simpson,Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester.
Lisa Simpson,Checkers.
Homer Simpson,Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.
Bart Simpson,"Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really can't afford this operation."
Bart Simpson,You're gonna just let him die?
Marge Simpson,I know you're upset --
Bart Simpson,Darn right I'm upset!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry."
Bart Simpson,We are not going to let our dog die! And that's IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
Homer Simpson,But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop."
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks, Mom."
Homer Simpson,All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog.
,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Please, do go on..."
Homer Simpson,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, please, continue..."
Homer Simpson,I thought maybe you...
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?"
Waylon Smithers,"People like dogs, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh... if YOU did it, sir?..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Exactly! You'd be fit to be tied! Dogs!
,
Marge Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,What?
Marge Simpson,You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
Homer Simpson,But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right, Marge."
Marge Simpson,I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
Homer Simpson,"Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?"
Marge Simpson,"No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College."
Bart Simpson,No problemo.
Marge Simpson,"I'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and I found a way to stretch the food budget. Fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. Ham night will be Spam night. And porkchop night..."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,... will now be chub night.
Homer Simpson,Chub? I don't even know what that is!
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of Encyclopedia Generica from the grocery store."
Lisa Simpson,"But, Mom, next week is volume four: Copernicus through Elephantiasis."
Marge Simpson,"We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
Marge Simpson,I don't think you've thought this through.
,
Nurse,"Good news, Mr. Danielson, we saved your gamecock. But I'm afraid he'll never fight again."
Mr. Danielson,That's what you think. He'll fight and he'll win!
Vet,Clamp. Wipe... No! No!
God,"Come to the light, boy. Come into the light. Come on now. There's a good boy. Come on. Come on."
Nurse,Um... Simpson?
Vet,It's times like this I'm glad I flunked out of dental school.
,
Homer Simpson,"Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?"
Marge Simpson,You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... snouts.
Kent Brockman,"Yes, I'm back. Kent Brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. Hey, I'm a journalist."
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
Marge Simpson,What's that?
Homer Simpson,A dinosaur.
Kent Brockman,"Of course I'm not the only one who benefited from last week's big payoff. Our state's schools got their share too. Here, lottery officials present Springfield Elementary with a brand new eraser."
Seymour Skinner,"One eraser? Oh, I'm used to my government betraying me. I was in Nam. I served for three --"
Kent Brockman,"And speaking of lotteries, here are the winning numbers for this week's forty-thousand dollar ""jackpot"": 3 - 6 - 17 - 18 - 22 and 29."
Marge Simpson,"Oh no! Those are my numbers! If it wasn't for that dog, I would've won!"
,
Miss Hoover,"Class, for tomorrow, I want you to write a report on Copernicus."
Lisa Simpson,
Sadistic Barfly,"C'mon boozehound! You want the twenty five cents, don't you? Keep singin'!"
Homer Simpson,BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS...
Young Barfly,Who's that old rummy?
Moe Szyslak,"Before his dog got sick, that ""old rummy"" used to be my best customer."
Homer Simpson,AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!
Sadistic Barfly,"Go get it, pal."
Homer Simpson,My quarter!!!
,
Trainee,"Okay, I'll just even this out and."
Trainee,Mr. Laswell! I've done it again.
,
Homer Simpson,"I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you."
Marge Simpson,Not now.
Lisa Simpson,Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?
Bart Simpson,Dumb dog.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, did you close the gate?"
Homer Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean tonight."
Marge Simpson,The dog will get out!
Homer Simpson,Bart! Close the gate.
Bart Simpson,Lisa! Close the gate.
Lisa Simpson,"Close the gate, Maggie."
Marge Simpson,Here boy!
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Here Santa's Little Helper!
Bart Simpson,It's all my fault. I called him a dumb dog.
Homer Simpson,Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Have you found a picture yet?
Marge Simpson,Not one that I want the public to see.
,
Ned Flanders,... So recycling is our way of giving Mother Earth a great big hug.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, it does sound like fun. I can't wait to start pawing through my garbage like some starving raccoon."
Marge Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Release the hounds. Well, neighbor I see you've got your running shoes on. That's a good thing."
C. Montgomery Burns,What's wrong with Crippler?
Waylon Smithers,"He's getting on, sir. He's been here since the late sixties."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah yes, I'll never forget the day he bagged his first hippie. That young man didn't think it was too ""groovy."""
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh.
C. Montgomery Burns,Why here's the fellow! Wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. Reminds me of me.
Homer Simpson,Uh...the last one.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now! As an attack dog, you'll be expected to neutralize intruders."
Waylon Smithers,Wanna buy some cookies? Wanna buy some cookies?
C. Montgomery Burns,If that were a real Girl Scout I'd have been bothered by now.
Barney Gumble,"I know how you feel, I lost my dog too. He's in here somewhere."
C. Montgomery Burns,Now here's a film that will turn you into a vicious souless killer. Enjoy.
,
Lisa Simpson,Poor Santa's Little Helper. I'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
Homer Simpson,"That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug."
Marge Simpson,"Homer get a-hold of yourself. Even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. Remember Doggie Heaven."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge! There is no such place!"
Homer Simpson,Or... to put it another way... there is.
Bart Simpson,I'm not giving up. I don't care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. I'm gonna find my dog.
Homer Simpson,And I'll be right here watching TV.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A! Poke-A Poke-A Poke-A!
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent!
,
Kent Brockman,"Hello, I'm Kent Brockman."
Bart Simpson,"Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog."
Homer Simpson,Two tickets for...
Ticket Man,"Let me guess. ""Look Who's Oinking""?"
Kent Brockman,"Hmm huh. And I suppose you want me to buy you a new one. You know, ever since I won the lottery, everybody wants a piece of Kent Brockman. Homeless this, and hungry that."
Bart Simpson,"Gee, I'm sorry mister."
Butler,"Sir, your llama just bit Ted Kennedy."
Kent Brockman,Good.
,
Waylon Smithers,"I, uh. I hate to interrupt your longevity treatment, sir. But there's a sweet little boy at the door."
C. Montgomery Burns,Release the hounds.
Bart Simpson,Santa's Little Helper! It's you! AAAGGGHHH!!
Bart Simpson,What's the matter boy? Don't you know me? I'm your buddy!
Bart Simpson,"I love ya, boy."
,
Homer Simpson,Let me pet him again!
Lisa Simpson,You already petted him for ten minutes.
Homer Simpson,I know. I want to pet him again!
Marge Simpson,You can pet the cat.
Homer Simpson,The cat? What's the point?
,
Lisa Simpson,"Look dad, there's a spot."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, there's a spot, dear."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, there's a good one."
Marge Simpson,"That spot says ""compact only""."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's just a suggested car size."
Homer Simpson,Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad."
Homer Simpson,"Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, they all look great."
Marge Simpson,"So, what are we going to see?"
Bart Simpson,Ernest Cuts The Cheese!
Lisa Simpson,"""Honey, I Hit A School Bus""!"
Homer Simpson,"Look Who's Oinking! ""Look Who's Oinking""!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and I will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. Hmm?"
Homer Simpson,That's right.
Ticket Man,Sold out.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Maybe we could see something a little more adult.
Homer Simpson,"Why Marge, you frisky little devil."
Homer Simpson,"We'll take two tickets to ""The Stockholm Affair."""
Marge Simpson,"Ooh! The paper called it a ""taut political thriller""."
Homer Simpson,Political!
,
General,"Mr. President, disturbing news. Serious cracks are developing in the Greco-Bolivian Alliance."
President,Get me Jed Kolick!
Homer Simpson,"Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky..."
Homer Simpson,"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!"
Homer Simpson,What?
,
Bart Simpson,"If you don't watch the violence, you'll never get desensitized to it."
Lisa Simpson,Just tell me when the scary part's over.
Bart Simpson,It's over.
,
Homer Simpson,I think that guy's a spy.
Marge Simpson,Well of course he's a spy. You just saw him go through spy school!
Homer Simpson,"Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, shut up, Homer! No one wants to hear what you think!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. Homer?..."
Bart Simpson,"Forget it, mom. Dad's really mad. The tendons are throbbing at the base of his neck..."
Bart Simpson,And stress is collecting in the trouble spots here... here... and here... Making for one unhappy pappy.
Homer Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, aren't you coming inside?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again."
Lisa Simpson,I guess that executive stress ball we got him for Christmas isn't working.
,
Homer Simpson,Mmm...
Homer Simpson,"Ew, a skunk!"
Homer Simpson,Oh no.
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a redneck bar."
,
Cowboy #1,"Hey, you, let's fight!"
Cowboy #2,Them's fightin' words!
Homer Simpson,Duff please.
Bartender,We don't sell Duff. We sell Fudd.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Fudd me."
Bar Owner,"All right, all right, uh, ladies and gentlemen, he's all healed up and he's back for more. Let's give a big drunken welcome to Yodelin' Zeke!"
Yodelin' Zeke,Yodel-lay-hee... Yodel-lay-hee... Yodel-lay-hee -- Arrgh!
Bar Owner,"Our next act is our very own singin' waitress, Lurleen!"
Bar Owner,"... So, I'm afraid drink service will stop for just a few moments while she --"
Bar Owner,They're all yours.
Homer Simpson,Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
Lurleen Lumpkin,Thank you. Tonight I'd like to try something a little different. It's a song I wrote while I was moppin' up your dried blood and teeth.
Lurleen Lumpkin,YOU WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ SWEAT AND BREAK YOUR BACK/
Homer Simpson,Yeah...
Lurleen Lumpkin,THEN YOU GO HOME TO YOUR CASTLE/ BUT YOUR QUEEN WON'T CUT YOU SLACK/
Homer Simpson,... that's true.
Lurleen Lumpkin,THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LOSIN' ALL YOUR HAIR/... THAT'S WHY YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT/...
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Lurleen Lumpkin,THAT'S WHY YOU FLIPPED YOUR PICK-UP TRUCK RIGHT OFF THE INTERSTATE/...
Homer Simpson,"That's right, except for the pick-up truck."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they..."
Moe Szyslak,Wha...wha... Wait a minute. You went to another bar?
Lurleen Lumpkin,"THERE'S A LOT OF BULL THEY HAND YOU/ THERE'S NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO/ YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ NO, YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO/ I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU/ BUT I DO/"
Homer Simpson,"Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya."
Lurleen Lumpkin,I'm listenin'.
Homer Simpson,Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"So what's your name, stranger?"
Homer Simpson,Homer J. Simpson.
Lurleen Lumpkin,My name's Lurleen Lumpkin.
Homer Simpson,That's a pretty name.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh, you think so?"
Homer Simpson,Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
Homer Simpson,Bye Lurleen.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"So long, Homer J. Simpson."
,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
Marge Simpson,Where were you all night?
Homer Simpson,I was just up at this bar in Spittle County.
Marge Simpson,You should have called. I was very worried.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'."
Marge Simpson,

Homer Simpson,I WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ I SWEAT AND BREAK MY BACK/

Lenny Leonard,Gheee... Homer's singing to his ball again.
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, and he's bowling a two-eighty."
Lenny Leonard,Oh yeah. THERE'S A KIND OF HUSH/ ALL OVER THE WORLD TONIGHT...
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?"
Moe Szyslak,Fudd? I thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, Homer."
,
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, if it isn't Homer J. Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town."""
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh, aren't you sweet."
Homer Simpson,Do you think I could get a copy of it?
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Sorry, darlin', all my songs are up here. ""I'm Bastin' a Turkey With My Tears"", ""Don't Look Up My Dress Unless You Mean It"", ""I'm Sick of Your Lyin' Lips and False Teeth""..."
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!"
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, I don't know."
Homer Simpson,Come with me!
Lurleen Lumpkin,Oh!
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"I SAID NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU, BUT I DOOO."
Music Store Owner,"Listen ma'am, my brother owns a radio station over in Weevilville, and with your permission, I'd like to take your CD to him."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Homer, it's your quarter, what do you say?"
Homer Simpson,I guess so.
,
D.J.,This is K-U-D-D five seventy A.M.
D.J.,"Hey, don't touch that dial -- you've got KUDD on it."
Moe Szyslak,"For the next half hour, beer's on the house."
Barney Gumble,"What'd you say, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,Nothin'.
Krusty the Clown,I thought I told you to stay away from my sister!
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, here's fifty bucks. Take her to the Copa."
Snake Jailbird,It's payback time!
Snake Jailbird,"Aww... puts this whole riot into perspective, doesn't it?"
,
Lisa Simpson,She's wonderful. I could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
Bart Simpson,Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJ's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's nice. But who is this woman?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
Marge Simpson,I don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife."
Marge Simpson,
,
,
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh Homer, everybody's been callin'! Mamma, Daddy, the triplets, Vonda Mae, Piney Jo... and I owe it all to you."
Homer Simpson,"Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Oh Homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin' somethin' in return."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Homer, you're just a big sack of sugar."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks. You did say sugar, right?"
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Uh-huh. Now, Homer, I want you to be my manager."
Homer Simpson,"Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures..."
Lurleen Lumpkin,That's okay.
Homer Simpson,I make a lot of stupid decisions...
Lurleen Lumpkin,Nobody's perfect.
Homer Simpson,I did bad in school.
Lurleen Lumpkin,I didn't even go.
Homer Simpson,My personal hygiene has been described as...
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Homer, Homer, you'll be a great manager. There's only one thing you need."
,
,
Salesman,Now this is made from a space-age fabric developed especially for Elvis. Sweat actually cleans this suit!
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at me."
Marge Simpson,I don't want to. I'm mad at you.
Marge Simpson,"I'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
Marge Simpson,Homer! Where did you get that suit?
Homer Simpson,A friend bought it for me.
Marge Simpson,Was it Lurleen?
Homer Simpson,No... I think it was Lenny.
Marge Simpson,Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?
Homer Simpson,No!
Marge Simpson,Have you kissed her?
Homer Simpson,No!
Marge Simpson,Has she kissed you?
Homer Simpson,A coupla times.
Marge Simpson,I want you to stop seeing her.
Homer Simpson,I can't. I'm her manager.
Marge Simpson,Her manager? That's ridiculous. I won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."
Marge Simpson,Your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. And you did it at the county fair last year. Remember?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there."
Marge Simpson,Fine. See if I care.
,
Mr. Boylan,"This studio has a lot of history. Buddy Holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, ""There is no way in hell that I'm gonna record in this dump""."
Homer Simpson,I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, how much did you just give that man?"
Homer Simpson,"Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Hey, Colonel Homer. And you must be..."
Marge Simpson,Mrs. Homer Simpson.
Lurleen Lumpkin,Charmed.
Marge Simpson,Hmmm. I thought you said she was overweight!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen."
Marge Simpson,What does that mean?
Lurleen Lumpkin,I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?
Homer Simpson,"I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!"
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, c'mon boys. Let's break some hearts."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY ON THE DIAMOND OF MY HEART/ WHEN THE COACH CALLED ME UP TO THE PLATE/ I'D BEEN SWINGIN' AND MISSIN' AND LOVIN' AND KISSIN'/ MY AVERAGE WAS POINT DOUBLE AUGHT EIGHT/ SO I SPIT ON MY HANDS/ KNOCKED THE DIRT FROM MY SPIKES/ AND POINTED RIGHT TOWARD CENTER FIELD/ THIS TIME I'M HITTIN' A HOME RUN/ THIS TIME LOVE IS FOR REAL/ I'LL SLIDE, I'LL STEAL,"
Bart Simpson,"Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?"
Homer Simpson,Stop it.
Lurleen Lumpkin,I'LL SACRIFICE/ A LOVING FLY FOR YOU/ I'VE BEEN SLUMPING ALL SEASON/ BUT NOW I'VE FOUND A REASON/ I STRUCK ON A LOVE THAT IS TRUE/ I USED TO PLAY THE FIELD/ I USED TO BE A ROAMER/ BUT THE SEASON'S TURNIN' 'ROUND FOR ME NOW/ I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER.
Lurleen Lumpkin,THAT'S RIGHT! I FINALLY BAGGED ME A HOMER.
Mr. Boylan,"Lurleen, we're gonna have to cut you off. We're getting some kind of grinding noise on the track."
Homer Simpson,"You, off the bench."
,
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV."
Lurleen Lumpkin,Oh Homer! You're as smart as you are handsome.
Homer Simpson,"Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Well, I have been working on something that could really heat things up."
Homer Simpson,Let's hear it.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"IN THIS TRAILER, I GET SO COLD AND LONELY/ LYIN' THERE AWAKE AT NIGHT/ MUTTERING IF ONLY YOU WEREN'T MARRIED/ SO I MIGHT ASK YOU TO BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ OH BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT/ I'M ASKIN' WILL YOU BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye."
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Uh, Homer, there's a hidden message to this song that you may have missed. Really listen. BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT..."
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh...
Lurleen Lumpkin,BUNK WITH ME TONIGHT...
Homer Simpson,Right...
Lurleen Lumpkin,That's right Homer J.
Homer Simpson,Uh... I gotta think about this.
Lurleen Lumpkin,
,
Marge Simpson,"All our money's tied up in this woman. If she fails, we're broke. If she succeeds, I have no husband. I don't know what to root for."
Patty Bouvier,You don't?
Marge Simpson,I gotta go. Homer...
Homer Simpson,"Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready."
Marge Simpson,"Just so you know, while you and Lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, Maggie cut her first tooth."
Homer Simpson,"That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?"
Marge Simpson,You're not even listening to me!
Homer Simpson,Sure they will.
Marge Simpson,"Kids, will you come in here?"
Marge Simpson,"You've got a wonderful family, Homer. Please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight."
Homer Simpson,Uh... I gotta go.
Bart Simpson,"As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit."
Announcer,Hold onto your pitch forks everybody! It's time again for...
Mule,Ya - hooooooo!
Announcer,"Starring, in alphabetical order... Yodelin' Zeke... Butterball Jackson... Freddy-boy and Yuma... Cloris Mozelle... Big Shirtless Ron... Orville and Hurley... Cathy May... Hip Diddler... Rooney!... ... The Ya-Hoo Recovering Alcoholic Jug Band... and tonight, in her syndicated TV debut... Lurleen!"
Lurleen Lumpkin,OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY...
Executive,"Excuse me, are you Colonel Homer Simpson?"
Homer Simpson,Yes I am.
Executive,"I'm from Rebel Yell Records, a division of Togasaki Corp. I'm interested in buying Lurleen's contract."
Homer Simpson,"Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy."
,
Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, they loved you."
Lurleen Lumpkin,Well thank you -- I'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
Homer Simpson,Is there anything you need?
Lisa Simpson,I'm sorry?
Lurleen Lumpkin,Well... you could make my evening complete.
Lurleen Lumpkin,What's wrong?
Homer Simpson,My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
Young Girl,Gross!
Girl,Thanks for dinner!
Pretty Girl,No!
Homer Simpson,At least could I have my dollar ba...
Marge Simpson,I'll love you for the rest of my life.
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family.
Homer Simpson,"Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
Lurleen Lumpkin,Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer."
Executive,I'll give you fifty bucks.
Homer Simpson,You son of a... Sold!
,
Orville,I caught my wife in bed with my best friend.
Hurley,You bitter?
Orville,Yeah. Bit him too.
M.C.,"And now, once again, Lurleen."
Marge Simpson,Homer?
Homer Simpson,Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
Marge Simpson,Always has been.
Lurleen Lumpkin,"Now I'd like to play a song I wrote just this minute. It's called ""Stand By Your Manager"". HIS NAME IS HOMER/ HE'S QUITE A MAN/ I TRIED TO KISS HIM/ BUT HOMER RAN."
Lurleen Lumpkin,SURE WISH I COULD SAY/ THAT I WAS HIS/ I HOPE THAT MARGE KNOWS/ JUST HOW LUCKY SHE IS.
Marge Simpson,I do.
Dinosaur Dad,Would you turn off that rock 'n' rock music!
Dinosaur Son,"Hey, don't have a Stegosaurus, man."
,
Lisa Simpson,These talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on TV.
Homer Simpson,"Look Maggie, they have a baby, too."
Bart Simpson,It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
Marge Simpson,"Now kids, I know you're all excited about meeting Aunt Selma's new boyfriend tonight."
Homer Simpson,Pfft.
Patty Bouvier,"But I think that before he gets here, I should tell you something about him. Something... disturbing."
Lisa Simpson,Ewww.
Homer Simpson,Ooooh.
Bart Simpson,Bleuh.
Patty Bouvier,"You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweetie's a jailbird."
Bart Simpson,"Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray."
Marge Simpson,"Now, now, he's an ex-convict. He's paid his debt to society."
Patty Bouvier,Then how come you're not using the good silverware?
Marge Simpson,I'm just not.
Marge Simpson,"That's them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity."
Selma Bouvier,"Everyone, I'd like you to meet --"
Lisa Simpson,Sideshow Bob!
Selma Bouvier,What the...?
Sideshow Bob,"Selma dear, I'm afraid the children's reaction is quite understandable."
Sideshow Bob,"You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison."
Bart Simpson,"That's right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery."
Homer Simpson,"Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
Homer Simpson,Lousy snitch.
Bart Simpson,
Sideshow Bob,"Ahh, Mr. Simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the Buddha."
Homer Simpson,I am not.
Sideshow Bob,"Yes, you are. One: existence is suffering. Two: the cause of suffering is desire. In this case, my desire to do high-quality children's programming."
,
Sideshow Bob,"When prison put an end to that dream, I became a seething cauldron of rage and recrimination..."
,
Bart Simpson,"Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum."
Selma Bouvier,Then call me Mrs. Scum!
Sideshow Bob,"When I was nominated for best supporting performer in a children's program at the Daytime Emmy Awards, my bitterness ruined what should have been the greatest night of my life."
,
Krusty the Clown,And the Emmy goes to... I don't believe this. Sideshow Bob.
,
Sideshow Bob,"This is one more Emmy than you'll ever win, you bantering jack-in-the-box!"
Krusty the Clown,"Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob."
Sideshow Bob,No-talent shill!
Krusty the Clown,Second banana!
Sideshow Bob,Panderer!
Krusty the Clown,Bore!
Sideshow Bob,"Stop it, stop... release me... ."
Krusty the Clown,"Now, for the highlight of the evening... Best film-to-video transfer..."
Sideshow Bob,"Do you know what prison is like for a life-long conservative Republican? In our over-crowded cell, we became little more than beasts."
Sideshow Bob,Who used my chapstick?
Cellmate #1,"Oh, I did. Here you go."
Sideshow Bob,I don't want it.
Sideshow Bob,My only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge against the boy who put me there...
,
Bart Simpson,Aye-Carumba!
Sideshow Bob,"Bart, if I wanted to kill you, I'd have choked you like a chicken as soon as I walked in that door."
FAMILY/EVERYONE,
Sideshow Bob,But then what kind of a guest would I have been?
Sideshow Bob,"Now where was I... Ah yes, my lowest ebb."
,
Sideshow Bob,You can't take my Emmy!
Guard,"Hey, you know the rules. Awards for excellence in entertainment are contraband. No Emmys, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe."
Sideshow Bob,But kismet can be kind as well as cruel. I received an answer to my letter from the prison pen pal program.
Selma Bouvier,White.
Bart Simpson,Knock it off.
Selma Bouvier,"Dear Number 24601, I need a man and I cannot find one among the law-abiding. I have a steady job, and a lucrative hobby filing nuisance law suits. I share an apartment with my twin sister. Enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike. I forget which one I am."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Dear Selma, your latest letter set off a riot in the maximum security wing of my heart."
Selma Bouvier,
,
Sideshow Bob,"Like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard, our love bloomed despite all obstacles."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, may I?"
Selma Bouvier,Uh-uh-uh. On the cheek.
Sideshow Bob,"Inspired by the love of a good woman, I resolved to be the best darned inmate Number 24601 I could be."
,
Sideshow Bob,I bade farewell to my cellmates and left with the woman I loved.
Sideshow Bob,"Cutter... Ice pick... Snake, I'm going to miss you most of all."
,
Lisa Simpson,"What a beautiful story, Sideshow Bob. You're living proof that our revolving door prison system works."
Marge Simpson,"Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl."
Selma Bouvier,
Patty Bouvier,"I've got to admit it, Selma. He's a once in a lifetime catch."
Sideshow Bob,"Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well."
Bart Simpson,I can't believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown.
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Sideshow Bob,"Indeed, I did. And I'd like to thank you for catching me, Bart. You seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of Selma."
Homer Simpson,Hear hear!.
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, would you mind if I did something bold and shocking in front of your family?"
Selma Bouvier,"All right, but no tongues."
Sideshow Bob,"Although kissing you would be like kissing some divine ashtray, that's not what I had in mind."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, will you marry me?"
Selma Bouvier,
Sideshow Bob,I suppose so.
Sideshow Bob,I KNOW I STAND IN LINE UNTIL I THINK YOU HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND AN EVENING WITH ME.
Selma Bouvier,AND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE TO DANCE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU WON'T BE LEAVIN' WITH ME.
Sideshow Bob,THEN AFTERWARDS WE DROP INTO A QUIET LITTLE PLACE AND HAVE A DRINK OR TWO.
Selma Bouvier,"AND THEN I GO AND SPOIL IT ALL BY SAYIN' SOMETHIN' STUPID LIKE ""I LOVE YOU""."
Selma Bouvier,Ahhh... ahhh... Hmmmm... Could you pumice my corns for me?
Sideshow Bob,Avec plaisir.
Kindly Old Gent,A... G... Q... Seven...
Selma Bouvier,Close enough. May you drive safely and find true love.
Announcer,We now return to the Twenty-seventh Annual Krusty the Clown Telethon for Motion Sickness.
Krusty the Clown,Tiffany! Woo hoo! I love you people! I love my kids! Poor little guys.
Krusty the Clown,"So tragic. So nauseous. You should see the bus they came to the studio in What's next? Oh yeah. And now, a man who needs no introduction -- the chairman of the company... you know who I'm talking about. Get out here, you goombah!"
Crooner,"Krusteleh, there's an old friend backstage who wants to say hello."
Krusty the Clown,Huh? Whuh?
Krusty the Clown,Come here you.
Sideshow Bob,"Oh... oh... oh, you old clown you."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, I missed ya."
Sideshow Bob,This guy is a national treasure.
Krusty the Clown,"That jerk I got to replace you, he isn't fit to hold your slide whistle."
,
Sideshow Mel,All I can be is myself.
,
Sideshow Bob,"Krusty, can you ever forgive me for framing you and putting you in jail?"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back in there."
Bart Simpson,That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Bart. If Krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him, surely you can too."
Sideshow Bob,"Oh Krusty, I can't tell you how much I missed this."
Marge Simpson,"Now, about your wedding dress. I'm not sure how to put this..."
Marge Simpson,White. And what would you like for appetizers?
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, appetizers."
Sideshow Bob,"Well Homer, you seem to be a trencherman. What should we serve?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!"
Sideshow Bob,"Well, Selma, he makes a good case."
Selma Bouvier,Get whatever you want. It all tastes like styrofoam to me.
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, dear -- I'm confused."
Selma Bouvier,"Well, when I was a kid we were playing with bottle rockets, and one shot straight up my nose. I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell."
Marge Simpson,"Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, this wedding is spinning out of control. Can we really afford it? I've already run through eight of the ten dollars they gave me when I left prison."
Selma Bouvier,"Hey relax, I told ya I got money. I bought stock in a mace company just before society crumbled."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, that's wonderful. I just hope people don't think I'm marrying you for your money, instead of your... less tangible qualities."
,
Sideshow Bob,Tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger. Isn't it grand?
Selma Bouvier,"Hey, Bob. Give some of that honey this way."
Selma Bouvier,"Holy frijoles! We've got ten minutes till MacGyver! Driver, here's a fin. Get me home and don't spare the whip."
Barney Gumble,"Whatever you say, mum."
,
Selma Bouvier,What did I miss?
Patty Bouvier,MacGyver was wearing a tank top.
Selma Bouvier,Dang.
Sideshow Bob,"Why Selma, I thought I was the only man in your life."
Selma Bouvier,Sit down and shut up.
Man,"Thank you, SeÃ±or MacGyver. You saved our village."
MacGyver,Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.
Selma Bouvier,That MacGyver's a genius.
Marge Simpson,"Ah, that's sweet."
Sideshow Bob,"First of all he's not a genius, he's an actor. And second, he's not much of an actor."
Selma Bouvier,You're lying! You're lying!
Sideshow Bob,"No Selma, this is lying: that was a well-plotted piece of non-claptrap that never made me want to retch."
,
Selma Bouvier,"He was so cruel... The things he said, they're just not true."
Marge Simpson,"There, there..."
Bart Simpson,"Oh well, I guess the wedding's off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrow's another day."
Marge Simpson,Bart! Stop that.
Selma Bouvier,"No, he's right. We're a package. Love me, love MacGyver. I guess the wedding's off."
Sideshow Bob,"Selma, I don't know what to say."
Selma Bouvier,Just tell me you like MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob,Very well. I... I... I can't do it! Even that car chase seemed tacked on.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?"
Homer Simpson,"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love."
Sideshow Bob,"Very well, Selma, whenever you watch MacGyver, I'll take a vigorous constitutional and return more in love with you than ever."
Selma Bouvier,Oh Bob.
Bart Simpson,Bart no like. Bad medicine.
,
Lisa Simpson,I could've been the flower girl. And I wouldn't keep falling down either.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, they chose Maggie, okay?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Do you Bob, take Selma, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part?"
Sideshow Bob,I do.
,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going?"
Patty Bouvier,I'm the only single girl left in the family.
Patty Bouvier,"Well, I guess it could be worse."
Seymour Skinner,SHUDDUP!
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, there's Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Dear friends, forty one years ago, God took one hundred and sixty-eight pounds of clay and he made me a woman. And for this, I thank Him."
Selma Bouvier,"I just wanted to say, on the advice of my new husband, I've decided to give up smoking."
Selma Bouvier,... Except for after meals and after MacGyver.
Sideshow Bob,"Why Selma dear, you'll bury us all."
Bart Simpson,"Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?"
Chief Wiggum,"Ahh, lighten up, son. If he was going to commit a crime, would he have invited the No. 1 cop in town? Now, where did I put my gun? Oh, yeah. I set it down when I got a piece of cake..."
Patty Bouvier,I don't know what to say.
Selma Bouvier,Just tell me what you know I want to hear.
Patty Bouvier,I'm dying of jealousy.
Selma Bouvier,Thank you.
,
Sideshow Bob,"That's right dear, enjoy your rest. The wedding was very tough on you, and the honeymoon is going to be... murder."
,
Selma Bouvier,Welcome to our video honeymoon. We're using the video camera Cousin Dot gave us and the video cassette Homer gave us.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
Selma Bouvier,There's Shelbyville Falls... Rolling Rock... And here's another breathtaking sight -- my brand new hubby.
Sideshow Bob,I wanted a room with a fireplace you brainless luggage monkey! Like the one in your brochure!
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, Selma dear, I was just chatting with my good friend, Dennis. Now, smile for the camera. That's a good lad."
Sideshow Bob,"Ah, fire: scourge of Prometheus, toaster of marshmallows, eradicator of deadwood... Oh Selma dear, you and your little camera. What do you say we shut it off for a while?"
Selma Bouvier,And make love?
Bart Simpson,Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
Marge Simpson,Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
Bart Simpson,Romantic? With Aunt Selma?
Marge Simpson,I guess you're just too young to understand.
,
Selma Bouvier,One of my fillings fell out.
Sideshow Bob,Even murder has its ugly side.
Selma Bouvier,"Bob, would you mind rubbing my feet?"
Sideshow Bob,"Darling, you make it sound like a chore."
Selma Bouvier,"Hmm, uh, good..."
Sideshow Bob,Soon I will kill you.
Selma Bouvier,Huh?
Sideshow Bob,"""Son pied sentis beau"". French, for ""Her foot smells lovely""."
Selma Bouvier,Ohhh.
Sideshow Bob,Prepare to be murdered.
Selma Bouvier,Huh?
Sideshow Bob,Be pah de be mudu. That's Sanskrit for your toes are like perfume. Voy a matar a usted.
Selma Bouvier,Whaa?
Sideshow Bob,"That's Spanish for, I'm going to kill you."
Selma Bouvier,Say what?
Sideshow Bob,"Why dear, I do believe it's time for your beloved MacGyver."
Selma Bouvier,"Oh, hey, you're right."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Well, time for my walk."
Selma Bouvier,
Sideshow Bob,Don't forget to die.
,
Patty Bouvier,Ding dong. I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma. Mind if I watch TV with you?
Marge Simpson,"Go ahead, Patty."
Announcer,Tonight on MacGyver...
Bart Simpson,Aunt Selma has one hour to live!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, down in front."
,
Sideshow Bob,Good bye.
Sideshow Bob,Front desk? There's been a terrible accident in my room.
Sideshow Bob,"Poor Selma, you were having such a lovely evening AND THEN I WENT AND SPOILED IT ALL BY DOING SOMETHING STUPID LIKE EXPLODE YOU."
Bart Simpson,"Sideshow Bob, I'm afraid the only victims here are the good people at Best Western Hotels."
Sideshow Bob,Bart!
Sideshow Bob,Selma!
Sideshow Bob,Ughhh.
Selma Bouvier,You tried to kill me. I want a separation.
Sideshow Bob,My best laid plans have gang aglay!
Bart Simpson,"Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?"
Chief Wiggum,"Well no, frankly, but that never stopped us before."
Sideshow Bob,"Bart, I must know. How did you untangle my web?"
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, Bart. Fill us in."
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'd hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job."
Chief Wiggum,"No, no, please. It's the only way I'll learn."
Bart Simpson,All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
Bart Simpson,Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma.
Selma Bouvier,I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.
Bart Simpson,"She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette..."
Selma Bouvier,"I decided to give up smoking... except for after meals, and after MacGyver."
,
Bart Simpson,Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!"
Homer Simpson,Come again?
Bart Simpson,"After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way."
Homer Simpson,To the Simpson mobile!
,
Bart Simpson,Noooo!
Sideshow Bob,"But wait! If you saved Selma, why did the room explode?"
Chief Wiggum,I'll field that one. Me and the boys were all celebrating a job well done when I threw my match in the vicinity of the crime scene.
,
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, right, the gas."
Sideshow Bob,"I'll be back! You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever! And when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies!"
Selma Bouvier,I feel like such a fool.
Marge Simpson,"Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Mom. Now. Let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate."

Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, let's book! I want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act."
Homer Simpson,"Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer."
Homer Simpson,Billy Beer!
Marge Simpson,My little guy's first rock concert. I hope the Spinal Taps don't play too loud.
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything."
Homer Simpson,I hear ya. Come on boy.
Selma Bouvier,There goes Davy Crocket in his bald skin cap.
Marge Simpson,
,
Bill,"In other Spinal Tap news, Mayor Quimby honored the aging super group in a ceremony at City Hall."
Marty,"I guess you could say he was trying to tap into the spines of the young voters, huh?"
Bill,... Yeah... Let's play the tape.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Milhouse, cool jacket!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"It cost me 50,000 Bazooka Joe Comics."
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, just meet me back here after the show."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Dad. Sure you're not gonna be bored?"
Homer Simpson,"Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Baby!"
T-shirt Guy,"Official ""Tour '92"" T-shirts, thirty-one dollars."
Promoter,"Uh, yeah, I don't wanna lie to you boys. Six days a week, the place is a hockey rink."
Comic Book Guy,"Check it out. Spinal Tap kicking Mo-mar Kadaffy in the butt. The timeless classic, now two for a dollar."
,
Marty,"Hey hey hey, Bill and Marty here."
Bill,And we're backstage rappin' with the Tap.
Marty,"Fellows, I'm gonna hit you with a phrase that has dogged you throughout your career: washed-up."
Bill,Yet here you are among the top one hundred and five concert acts today. What's your secret guys?
David,"Well, after the Berlin Wall fell, our records started selling on the dismal side of the Iron Curtain, and naturally that gave us a boost."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"We're very big in Bulgaria, and wassisname, the other garia."
David,Hungaria.
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Yeah, whoever."
DEREK,I can't think of anyone who's benefited more from the death of Communism than us.
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Oh, maybe the people who actually live in the Communist countries."
DEREK,"Oh yeah, hadn't thought of that. I bet you're right."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Yeah, on the other hand, each of us just bought out own soccer team. How many Hungarias can say that, eh?"
Roadie,Test... test...
Bart Simpson,"Gee, I'm sorry, man."
Stoned Guy,Huh?
Bart Simpson,About the frisbee.
Stoned Guy,Frisbee?
Bill,"Say guys, I wonder if you'd mind recording a couple of promos for us."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Well, like what?"
Marty,"Maybe you could say, ""Nobody rocks like Bill and Marty on KBBL."""
David,"Well, we don't know that, do we?"
Nigel Bakerbutcher,What if somebody rocks as good as you?
DEREK,"Or better. I mean, we don't want to look stupid."
Bill,"Okay, we can respect that."
Marty,"How about ""Rock-a-doodle-do, you're listening to Bill and Marty."""
David,"Yeah, sure."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,That's good... yeah.
,
Crowd,Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap! Tap!
David,"I just looked out, and there's puddles of water all over the freakin' stage!"
Bart Simpson,I said slag off!
David,"Yeah, well this is a rock concert, not the bleedin' ...Splish Splash show!"
,
Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Duff Beer, in association with Laramie Cigarettes, is proud to welcome... SPINAL TAP!"
David,WE ARE THE CHILDREN WHO GREW TOO FAST...
DAVID/NIGEL,WE ARE THE DUST OF THE FUTURE PAST...
DAVID/NIGEL/DEREK,WE RAISE OUR VOICES IN THE NIGHT/ CRYING TO HEAVEN...
David,AND WILL OUR VOICES BE HEARD/ OR WILL THEY BREAK LIKE THE WIND!
David,Medium setting!
,
,
Nigel Bakerbutcher,Thank you!
David,All riiiight! This morning we were driving down... Route 401...
Bart Simpson,That's only four miles from my house!
Nigel Bakerbutcher,And we thought they knew how to rock in Shelbyville...
DEREK,But nobody rocks like...Springfield!
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Well, it seems some silly twit did not get a big enough oxygen pump, but that's supposed to be a devil."
David,"Filled up with air, it's very evil and impressive."
DEREK,"We salute you, our half-inflated Dark Lord."
DEREK,"Y'know, people think there are only five members of Spinal Tap, but they're wrong."
David,"Could we turn up the house lights please? That was the cue to turn up the house lights, so we can tell the audience they're the sixth member of the freakin' group."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"We are trying to put a tiny thrill into their gray little lives. Oh, forget it, turn on the lasers."
Nigel Bakerbutcher,Aagh! My vision!
Nigel Bakerbutcher,That's it. Show's over.
David,"Goodnight, Springton. There will be no encores."
Milhouse Van Houten,They were only on for twenty minutes!
Bart Simpson,What a gyp!
Otto Mann,"Gnarly show, man."
Snake Jailbird,Wanna trash the stage?
Otto Mann,Okay.
,
Bart Simpson,Cool.
,
Bart Simpson,Knock it off.
Homer Simpson,THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...
,
,
Kent Brockman,"Tonight a city weeps as, for the first time ever, a hockey arena becomes a scene of violence --following a concert by Spinal Tap."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, I hope my poor little baby's okay."
Lisa Simpson,See for yourself.
Marge Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"Of course, it would be wrong to suggest that this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll. After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"". So what's the answer? Ban all music? In this reporter's opinion the answer, sadly, is yes."
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Mom."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, oh... thank God!"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I want to be a rock star."
Marge Simpson,We'll discuss it later. Is Milhouse okay?
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Help! Help!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I've been thinking about what Bart said. If he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should BUY him A GUITAR."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar."
Marge Simpson,I meant a real guitar.
Homer Simpson,This is real.
Bart Simpson,Wow!
Marge Simpson,And it came with a free instruction book.
Homer Simpson,"Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!"
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him."
Bart Simpson,"I'd like to play me latest chart-topper. It's called ""Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs."""
,
Bart Simpson,
Manager,"Bart, you've got to go on."
Bart Simpson,Slag off!
Milhouse Van Houten,"You've changed, man. You used to be about the music."
Lisa Simpson,I'se just jammin' with you.
,
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Simpson, what are you trying to play?"
Bart Simpson,Polly Wolly Doodle.
Nelson Muntz,"Oh yeah, well it sounds Polly Wolly Crappy. Haw haw! Burn."
Otto Mann,"Hey, cherry axe, Bart-dude."
Bart Simpson,I think it's broken.
Otto Mann,"Oh, really? Give it here."
Bart Simpson,"I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto-man!"
Otto Mann,"Hey, that's all I did in high school. My old man said I was wasting my time and I'd never amount to anything."
Otto Mann,Now I'd like to slow things down a little bit...
Otto Mann,IF I LEAVE HERE TOMORROW... WOULD YOU STILL REMEMBER ME?
,
Otto Mann,...CANNOT CHAEAEAEANGE... WAOWAOWAOWAOW...
Martin Prince,"Although I'm sure I will receive a severe wedgie from my bus mates, I must remind you we should have been at school ten minutes ago."
Martin Prince,Whoooa!
Otto Mann,"Uh oh. Better fasten your seatbelts, little dudes."
Lisa Simpson,We don't have seatbelts.
Otto Mann,"Huh... well then, just try to go limp."
Otto Mann,Better take a shortcut.
,
,
,
David,Good show last night.
Nigel Bakerbutcher,"Yeah, quite good."
,
,
Chief Wiggum,Good Lord! Did anyone get the license number?
,
,
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, it's a miracle no one was hurt."
Otto Mann,I stand on my record. Fifteen crashes and not a single fatality.
Lou,"Let's see your license, pal."
Otto Mann,"No can do. Never got one. But if you need proof of my identity, I wrote my name on my underwear."
Otto Mann,"Oh, wait, these aren't mine."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Well, that tears it. Until you get a license and wear your own underwear, mister, you are suspended without pay."
Otto Mann,Who's gonna drive the bus?
Seymour Skinner,I drove an all-terrain vehicle in Da Nang. I think I can handle it.
,
Bart Simpson,Where's Otto?
Seymour Skinner,Otto. That's one palindrome you won't be hearing for awhile.
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,Off we go!
Kids,"HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER / HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN."
Seymour Skinner,"HE DRINKS AND HE CUSSES / HE STINKS UP THE BUSSES/HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER MAN! HA HA!"
Seymour Skinner,Dum de dum... There's an opening. Too late!... Nope... Nope... That'd be cutting it a little close.
Lisa Simpson,"I think you have to be more aggressive, sir."
Seymour Skinner,Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in.
,
Patty Bouvier,
Selma Bouvier,What's so funny?
Patty Bouvier,I was just thinking about the time Homer got his nose caught in the toaster.
Selma Bouvier,"We'll watch the tape tonight. Oh look, you've got someone at your window."
Otto Mann,Dododo do do do.
Patty Bouvier,"My name's Patty. I'll be testing you. When you do good, I use the green pen. When you do bad, I use the red pen. Any questions?"
Otto Mann,"Yeah, one. Have you always been a chick? I mean, I don't want to offend you but you were born a man, weren't you? You can tell me, I'm open-minded."
Patty Bouvier,I won't be needing this.
,
Otto Mann,"All right! Yeah!... So, how'd I do?"
Patty Bouvier,"Well, you failed every segment and misspelled ""bus"" on your application."
Otto Mann,Drag.
,
Seymour Skinner,Let me in! Let me in!
Ralph Wiggum,"HE STEPS ON THE CLUTCH, AND THE TOILET GOES FLUSH / HAIL TO THE--"
Otto Mann,"Hey Landlord, some clown changed my locks, padlocked the door and put up an eviction notice."
Landlord,"Yeah, that was me."
Otto Mann,You! But... but why?
Landlord,Because you haven't paid your rent.
Otto Mann,"Well, can I at least get my stuff?"
Landlord,All I found in there was a jar of mustard and a couple of old cycle magazines.
Otto Mann,"Wow, I had mustard?"
,
Bart Simpson,"Rough day, Apu. Pump me a Squishee and don't spare the syrup."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Perhaps you'd like to try an experimental flavor of my own concoction. A delicious Chutney-Squishee.
Bart Simpson,Uh... okay.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,You can really taste the chutney.
Bart Simpson,Uggh...
Otto Mann,Ow!
Bart Simpson,Otto-man?
Bart Simpson,You're living in a dumpster?
Otto Mann,"Oh, man, I wish. ""Dumpster"" brand trash bins are top of the line. This is just a ""Trash-Co"" waste disposal unit."
Bart Simpson,"Otto, why don't you come home with me? You can stay in our garage."
Otto Mann,"A garage?! Oh, somebody up there likes me."
Otto Mann,
,
,
Otto Mann,"I FEEL LIKE ROCKIN' SO I THINK I WILL / I'LL ROCK IT, ROCK IT, ROCK IT 'TIL I GET MY FILL... YEAH!"
Otto Mann,Ooh! Hey.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, what's going on?"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it."
Marge Simpson,What conversation?
Bart Simpson,"Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? He sure can!"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what were you thinking?"
Marge Simpson,That's not my voice!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape."
,
Marge Simpson,I don't understand this. Why can't you stay with your parents?
Otto Mann,The admiral and I don't get along. Please let me stay here. I've got nowhere else to go.
Homer Simpson,Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, Otto's going through a real tough time. Can't he stay with us for awhile?"
Marge Simpson,"I know we didn't ask for this, Homer, but doesn't the Bible say, ""Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"""
Homer Simpson,"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
Bart Simpson,"Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can."
Homer Simpson,All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage.
Otto Mann,"Wow, what's the catch?"
,
Tv Host,A can of corn costs... fifty-seven cents!
Otto Mann,I could sure go for a can of corn.
Marge Simpson,"Otto, you can't just sit there watching TV all day."
Otto Mann,"You know, you're right. I should do a little reading. You got any of those ""Where's Waldo"" books?"
Marge Simpson,No.
Otto Mann,How about anything written from the Vampire's point of view?
Marge Simpson,No.
Otto Mann,"Well, how 'bout anything where guys send in naked pictures of their chicks?"
Marge Simpson,"Otto, I think you should get a job."
Otto Mann,"Look, the only thing I was ever good at was driving a bus and now ""the man"" says I need a piece of paper to do that."
Marge Simpson,So get that piece of paper!
Otto Mann,"I tried -- Oh, Lord, how I did try."
,
Homer Simpson,Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
Homer Simpson,"That's better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?"
Bart Simpson,"I'll tell you the truth, Dad. I wasn't good at it right away, so I quit. I hope you're not mad."
Bart Simpson,"You can do it, Otto. You're the coolest adult I ever met."
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson,"Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV."
Bart Simpson,What's on?
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter.
,
Homer Simpson,Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling.
Otto Mann,"Hey, Pop 'N'Fresh. You're supposed to giggle."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,That guy has gotta go.
Marge Simpson,"I know how you feel, but he is good with the kids."
Otto Mann,"... So the lady drove faster, but the strange car kept banging into her from behind."
Lisa Simpson,
Otto Mann,"So finally she swerves off the road into the woods and lost the other car. And that's when she realized the man in the other car wasn't trying to hurt her. No, he was trying to warn her... about the ax-wielding maniac hiding in her back seat!"
Lisa Simpson,Did the maniac kill her?
Otto Mann,Natch! And you know how I know?
Lisa Simpson,How?
Otto Mann,Because... I was that maniac!
Otto Mann,"Hey, hey, I was just kidding."
Homer Simpson,That's it. He's outta here.
Marge Simpson,"But Homer, we're the only family he's got..."
Homer Simpson,"I don't care. This is not ""Happy Days"" and he is not the Fonz."
Otto Mann,"Heyyy, Mr. S..."
Homer Simpson,"Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!"
Otto Mann,Heavy.
Bart Simpson,"What are you going to do, Otto?"
Otto Mann,"Oh, don't worry. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who knows how to fake his own death."
Marge Simpson,"Well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again."
,
Otto Mann,Wow! I've never been called an adult before. I've been tried as one but... I'll do it!
,
Otto Mann,"""Alcohol increases your ability to drive."" False? Oh, man."
,
Otto Mann,"I don't know about this Bart dude. Your dad is right, I am a bum."
Bart Simpson,"He didn't call you a bum, he called you a sponge."
Otto Mann,Sponge?!
Otto Mann,Does this look like something a sponge would do I'll show him who's a sponge.
Patty Bouvier,"Well, if it isn't Wee Willy Washout."
Otto Mann,I want to take the test again.
Patty Bouvier,Why?
Otto Mann,So I can staple my license to Homer Simpson's big bald head.
Patty Bouvier,"Really? Well, here's your written test."
Patty Bouvier,"I'll get you started. B, C, D, A, B."
,
Otto Mann,Homer had a piece of food on his face for three days.
Patty Bouvier,
Otto Mann,It wasn't little either. It was a chicken wing.
Patty Bouvier,Wing.
Otto Mann,What was that?
Patty Bouvier,It doesn't matter. Let's get some Margaritas. I'm buyin'!
,
Bart Simpson,Otto!
Otto Mann,That's what my driver's license says.
Kids,"HAIL TO THE BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER, BUS DRIVER..."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, hail to the bus driver... Bus Driver Man!"
,
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Homer Simpson,What the...
Bart Simpson,
,
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart, look at this. My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted."
Bart Simpson,Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future."
Bart Simpson,Will I pass my English test?
Bart Simpson,Outlook not so good. Wow! It does work!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Let me try. Will I get beat up today? ""All signs point to yes."""
Nelson Muntz,That ball knows everything.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I got a good one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till we're toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) ""Don't count on it."" Will Milhouse and I be friends when we're high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? ""It looks doubtful."" Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?"
Bart Simpson,What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
,
Seymour Skinner,Samantha I've always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do.
Samantha Stanky,"I'm a good student, Principal Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah sure, and they told me I'd get a big parade when I got back from 'Nam. Instead they spat on me. I can still feel it searing. So, now let's just see what the permanent record has to say, shall we?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... no detention... fairly good attendance record... Oh, I see you beat that bed wetting problem in the second grade."
Samantha Stanky,That's in there?
Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry. They'll forget. Just like they forgot about me in that tiger cage for eighteen agonizing months. Every night I'd wake up screaming. Well, let's meet your classmates."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, was this thing right about your test?"
Bart Simpson,"To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say ""Behold my ""F!"""
Seymour Skinner,"Attention class, I have a new student for you."
Edna Krabappel,"Great, another student. Just keep packing 'em in, Seymour."
Seymour Skinner,"I think we should discuss this later, Edna. Now, it's never easy to come to a new school, so let's make her feel right at home. Please say a big elementary school hello to Samantha Stinky."
Samantha Stanky,Stanky.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, right. How embarrassing for you. Well, goodbye."
Edna Krabappel,"I'm sure this is a little scary for you, dear."
Samantha Stanky,Uh-huh.
Edna Krabappel,So why don't you stand up in front of the class and tell us about yourself? I'll be grading you on grammar and poise.
Samantha Stanky,"We just moved here from Phoenix. My Dad owns a home security company. He came to Springfield because of its high crime rate and lackluster police force. All my friends are back in Phoenix, and this town has a weird smell that you're all probably used to -- but I'm not."
Edna Krabappel,"It'll take you about six weeks, dear."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Sure.
Milhouse Van Houten,Eew!
Bart Simpson,"Victim number four. Hey, Lewis, can I interest you in a wet willie?"
Lewis Clark,Sure!
Milhouse Van Houten,
Milhouse Van Houten,When I find out who hit me with that ball... I'm gonna tear 'em a new...
Milhouse Van Houten,Wuh.
Edna Krabappel,"Class, in order to explain why your hormones will soon make you an easy target for every smooth talking Lothario with his own car and tight jeans, I will now show a short sex education film."
Edna Krabappel,"Ezekiel and Ismail, in accordance with your parents' wishes, you may step out into the hall and pray for our souls."
,
Bart Simpson,Bo-ring!
Kids,Eew!
Edna Krabappel,She's faking it.
Edna Krabappel,Any questions?
Nelson Muntz,"Mrs. Krabappel, how come you don't live with Mr. Krabappel?"
Edna Krabappel,Because Mr. Krabappel chased something small and fluffy down a rabbit hole.
Samantha Stanky,How do we know when we fall in love?
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, don't you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone."
Bart Simpson,"How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?"
Edna Krabappel,"I'm sorry, that would be playing God."
Bart Simpson,"God shmod, I want my monkey-man."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Ah, that's a nice dress."
Samantha Stanky,My dad makes me wear it. I hate it.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I hate it too. Uh -- can I walk you home?"
Samantha Stanky,Okay.
,
Otto Mann,"Everybody on, but no shoving. Just kiddin', you can shove all you want."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait Otto-man, you can't leave. Milhouse isn't here yet."
Otto Mann,"Sorry Bart-dude, no time. My girlfriend's dancing topless at the airport bar from four fifteen to four twenty."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise."
Samantha Stanky,Hi.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, what's with the skirt?"
Milhouse Van Houten,I've brought friends to this treehouse before.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude?"
Samantha Stanky,Maybe I should go.
Homer Simpson,So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories.
,
Bart Simpson,"No, that's okay. You can stay. You can read comics with us. Let's see, something for the lady...ah, ""Radioactive Man Vs. the Swamp Hag."
Samantha Stanky,"Got any girl comics? Like ""Bonnie Craine, Girl Attorney,"" ""Punkin & Duncan, the Twinkle Twins,"" or ""L'il Kneesocks?"""
Bart Simpson,"No, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics."
Bart Simpson,you guys wanna see something gross?
Bart Simpson,
Announcer,"Tonight on Smartline -- ""I'm Okay, You're Too Fat"". Here's your host, Kent Brockman."
Kent Brockman,"Good evening. Did you know that thirty-four million American adults are obese? Taken together, that excess blubber could fill the Grand Canyon two-fifths of the way up. That may not sound impressive, but keep in mind it is a very big canyon."
,
Homer Simpson,This sucks. Where is that channel changer?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance."
Kent Brockman,"Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man. Dom DeLuise, Alfred Hitchcock, and of course, Santa Claus. But in real life, Santa would be suffering from gallstones, hypertension, impotence, and diabetes."
Marge Simpson,I wish they had never invented fried cheese!
Grave Digger,We've got to widen the hole.
Crane Operator,"Well, make it snappy. The chain's startin' to give!"
Female Announcer,"We take eighteen ounces of sizzling ground beef and soak it in rich creamery butter. Then we top it off with bacon, ham and a fried egg. We call it the ""Good Morning Burger!"""
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,I gotta help him.
,
Samantha Stanky,
Bart Simpson,"Okay, Milhouse... I'll trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel."
Bart Simpson,"Deal! Next on the trading block, your Mickey Mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of Homer on the couch."
Samantha Stanky,"Milhouse, I gotta go."
Samantha Stanky,My dad thinks I'm having my braces examined.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, you kinda-sorta are."
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, we're living in the age of cooties. I can't believe the risk you're running. Besides, what's so great about kissing?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, it's not just the kissing. A lot of it is waitin' to kiss. You know like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little bit for it to melt?"
Bart Simpson,But she doesn't melt.
Milhouse Van Houten,Oh yes she does!
Female Announcer,We start with pure milk chocolate...
Homer Simpson,Chocolate...
Female Announcer,Add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, sweet."
Female Announcer,Then we sprinkle on four kinds of sugar...
Female Announcer,And dip it in rich creamery butter.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, what if I told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?"
Homer Simpson,"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?"
Lisa Simpson,According to Eternity Magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. That's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
Lisa Simpson,"They'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. As you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less."
Homer Simpson,"Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, I love you just the way you are. Lisa, what's that number?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Operator, I'd like to place an order for my husband."
Operator,"Would he like to lose weight, stop smoking, learn the state capitals, master hostage negotiations..."
Marge Simpson,Hmmm... Hostage negotiations.
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?"
Marge Simpson,Better give me the weight loss tape.
,
Worker #1,"We're out of ""Subliminally Slim."""
Worker #2,"Eh, just send him the vocabulary builder."
Worker #1,"Here you go, fatso."
,
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"Hello, this is Doctor Marvin Monroe ""Let's build your vocabulary"" A: abattoir: slaughterhouse. ""The cow was slaughtered in the abattoir."""
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?"
Homer Simpson,"Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
Marge Simpson,Don't you usually play with Milhouse after school?
Bart Simpson,He has a girlfriend.
Marge Simpson,Milhouse?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, all they do is kiss."
,
Bart Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,How cute.
,
,
Bart Simpson,Hey Martin.
Martin Prince,Bart? This is the first time anyone has ever sat next to me since I successfully lobbied to have the school day extended by twenty minutes.
Bart Simpson,"Listen Martin, right now I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl."
Martin Prince,That's me. I'm just as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school?"
Martin Prince,"It's a date. Everyone, Bart and I would like to announce that we are friends!"
,
Martin Prince,"Now Bart, would you care to listen to me play the lute?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, sure."
Martin Prince,"""COME HOME MY BONNIE WARRIOR, / FOR NOW THE NETS ARE FULL OF FISH --"""
,
Marge Simpson,I don't know if that tape is working. You ate three desserts tonight.
Homer Simpson,Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
Marge Simpson,There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
Homer Simpson,"Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
Marge Simpson,What in God's name are you talking about?
Marge Simpson,Oh.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, guys."
Man,"Wow, that really took my mind off those awful transforming space mutants."
Woman,Good.
Man,"Man, I could sure go for a snack."
Woman,Me too.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go spit on the Principal's car?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Listen, Bart... there's such a thing as spendin' too much time together."
Bart Simpson,Oh. Fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, wait!"
Bart Simpson,Yeah?
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh... can we still use your tree house?
Bart Simpson,What? Get bent.
Milhouse Van Houten,If her father catches us -- he'll kill her.
Bart Simpson,"All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Thanks, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy!"
,
Homer Simpson,Now there's a Machiavellian countenance.
Homer Simpson,Ooh...a sextet of ale.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Stanky... I have some shocking news about your daughter Samantha... Who am I? Let's just say I'm a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands."
,
Samantha Stanky,I bet you had peanut butter for breakfast.
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah...
Mr. Stanky,Samantha!
Samantha Stanky,Dad!
Mr. Stanky,Nooooooooooo!
Mr. Stanky,"Samantha, you're my little girl and sometimes my imagination runs away with me. Just, just tell me what happened."
Samantha Stanky,"Well, Milhouse and I --"
Mr. Stanky,That's enough! I'm putting you in an all girls school. You're never going to see that boy again.
Samantha Stanky,Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten,Samantha!
Bart Simpson,"Well Milhouse, ""'Tis better to have loved and lost""... yada yada yada... let's go to the arcade."
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Milhouse Van Houten,"How could this happen? We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy."

Dr. Marvin Monroe,Haruspicy: Predicting the future through the study of animal entrails.
Lisa Simpson,Dad! Dad! Do you know what today is?
Homer Simpson,The vernal equinox?
Lisa Simpson,No. It's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. Let's get you on the scale.
Lisa Simpson,You've gained thirteen pounds.
Homer Simpson,Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!
,
Chuck,There stands a broken man.
Ralph Wiggum,It's recess everywhere but in his heart.

Lisa Simpson,"Hey Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger."
Bart Simpson,"Five fingers? Ew, freak show. Listen, Lis. I need some advice and mom's not here."
Lisa Simpson,Why didn't you go to dad?
Bart Simpson,"I did, but I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. Lisa, I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know I did it."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, according to ""Eternity"" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. Dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. So I guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to Milhouse."
,
Luann Van Houten,"Bart, I'm glad you're here. Milhouse could use a friend like you."
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
,
Bart Simpson,Milhouse?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, I didn't want you to see me cry."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, come on, I've seen you cry a million times. You cry when you scrape your knee. You cry when they're out of chocolate milk. You cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I didn't want you to see me cry this time."
,
Bart Simpson,"Listen, Milhouse. I've got a confession to make. I'm the one who narked on your kissing."
Milhouse Van Houten,What?!
Luann Van Houten,Milhouse is out of bed and full of beans.
Kirk Van Houten,"Whoa, it's a miracle!"
Bart Simpson,"Boy, I bet the 8-ball didn't see that one comin'."
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah.
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
Marge Simpson,You mean a spoon?
Homer Simpson,Yuh. Yuh. Yuh.
Homer Simpson,Yeah that's good.
,
Bart Simpson,Are you sure you want to do this?
Milhouse Van Houten,I can't stop thinking about her. Even these gates remind me of her braces.
Bart Simpson,How are we going to find her?
Milhouse Van Houten,She said she'd be wearing a plaid jumper.
Samantha Stanky,Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Samantha, I'm sorry about gettin' you thrown in the penguin house."
Samantha Stanky,"That's all right, Bart. I love Saint Sebastian's. It's run by a group of French Canadian nuns. They're very nice, except they never let me out."
Nun,"Dominique - nique - nique, etc."
NUN #2,"Samantha, ne pas de boys!"
Samantha Stanky,"I have to go now, Milhouse."
Samantha Stanky,I'd better not. It's fifty rosaries a kiss.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, okay."
Samantha Stanky,"Oh, what the heck."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, think I can ever find another one like her?"
Bart Simpson,"You're asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now let's go whip donuts at old people"
,
Homer Simpson,"Forgot there was a physical today, huh?"
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah. Hey, Homer, can I borrow your underwear?"
Doctor,This can't be right. This man has 104% body fat!
Doctor,"Hey, no eating in the tank!"
Homer Simpson,Go to hell.

Marge Simpson,"How was your day at work, dear?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, I'm afraid Homer Simpson is sterile."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who?
Waylon Smithers,One of your cabbage heads from Sector 7-G. Take a look at this sperm sample from his recent physical.
C. Montgomery Burns,Ewww.
Waylon Smithers,"Now, compare this with a normal sperm sample."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hm. Oh yes.
Waylon Smithers,I'm afraid radiation from the plant is the reason he's shooting blanks. He could sue us for millions.
C. Montgomery Burns,Mother of pearl. Call my lawyers!
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Before you begin, let me make one thing clear to you. I want your legal advice. I even pay for it. But to me you're all vipers. You live on personal injury. You live on divorces. You live on pain and misery...... but I'm rambling. Anybody want any coffee?"
Lawyer,I'll have some coffee.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue."
Lawyer,"If you offer Mr. Simpson a token sum -- say, a couple thou -- he'll be so dazzled, he'll sign anything you shove under his nose."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot."
Lawyer,Do you have any cream?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yes, of course. Where are my manners?"
,
Bum,"Yeah... I used to be rich. I owned ""Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors"". Then those Disney sleezeballs shut me down. I said, ""Look, I'll change the logo, put Mickey's pants back on"". Some guys you just can't reason with."
HERB,"Well, I used to own a successful car company. My strategy was givin' them Japanese names. You guys ever drive a Tempura Hatchback?"
HERB,"Yeah, life was sweet. Then I found out I had a long lost half- brother."
,
HERB,Homer!
Homer Simpson,Herb?
HERB,I let him design a car that would make or break my company.
,
Female Announcer,Presenting... The Homer!
HERB,I'm ruined!
HERB,"Forbes Magazine called it the ""Blunder of the Century."" A little overblown, don't you think? What about new Coke?"
WILLIAM POWEL LOOKALIKE,"Hey, I invented that."
HERB,"Yeah, but all that's in the past. Because this is America and in America you're never finished as long as you've got a brain in your head. Because all a man really needs is an idea."
Bum,"Well, I'm lit."
Bum #2,Me too.
,
Bart Simpson,"And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics."
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you two...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?"
Bart Simpson,"We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise."
Lisa Simpson,We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
Bart Simpson,"There, there. You're safe now, little sister."
Homer Simpson,"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories."

Homer Simpson,"Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house."
,
HERB,"Let's see, I need an idea... idea... idea... What's the matter with me? I used to have hundreds of ideas."
Mother,What do you want? I just changed your diaper. Are you hungry? Are you cold? Do you want to go home?
HERB,"Lady, you just gave me the idea of a lifetime. How do I thank you?"
Mother,Please don't hurt me.
HERB,Consider it done.
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey pal, I heard about the couch."
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, you gonna to be okay?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse."
Homer Simpson,That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse.
Waylon Smithers,Simpson! Report to Mr. Burns' office at once!
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Is this the one with the lazy sperm?
Waylon Smithers,Hmmm hmmm.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. How would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?"
Homer Simpson,Would I!
C. Montgomery Burns,All you have to do is sign this form.
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... Montgomery Burns... uh... Award for... a-a-a Outstanding Achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, Excellence!"
Homer Simpson,Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?

Men Singers,OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT IN -
Female Singers,THE FIELD OF --

Homer Simpson,Herb!
C. Montgomery Burns,Yess... that was Bonita De Wolf and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft Shoe Society.
Lisa Simpson,This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw.
Bart Simpson,What about the Emmys?
Lisa Simpson,I stand corrected.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And now to present the award, here's former heavyweight champion, Smokin' Joe Frazier."
,
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Webster's Dictionary defines excellence as ""the quality or condition of being excellent"". And now, the winner of the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence."
Homer Simpson,Please please please please please...
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you know you won."
Homer Simpson,Don't jinx it!
Smokin' Joe Frazier,The winner... Homer Simpson!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!"
,
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Keep those pickled eggs comin', Moe."
Moe Szyslak,You cleaned me out Smokin' Joe. What's the matter Homer? Cummerbund too tight?
Homer Simpson,I miss my couch.
Smokin' Joe Frazier,I know how you feel. You lost a couch. I lost a heavyweight championship.
Homer Simpson,Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind.
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Homer, I know things are tough now. But one day you'll be walking along and you'll see a piece of furniture that you can love just as much."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Frazier, shut up!"
Smokin' Joe Frazier,"Barney, you've been riding my back all night."
Barney Gumble,Oh yeah? Care to step outside?
Smokin' Joe Frazier,Let's do it.
Homer Simpson,I think I'm gonna take a walk.

Barney Gumble,All right! A peanut!

HERB,"I'm telling you, all a man needs is an idea. And I've got an idea."
Bum #2,Then how come you're still a bum?
HERB,"All right. A man needs two things, an idea and money to get it off the ground. Hello, what's this?"
HERB,"""Local man, Homer Simpson, receives award and $2,000 check."" Hmmm... Any of you guys know which freight goes to Springfield?"
HERB,Uh-uh. Nope. Nope. That's the one.
,
,
Homer Simpson,"I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless."
Homer Simpson,Wow. The Spine Melter 2000.
,
Homer Simpson,Give me full power.
Salesman,But sir...
Homer Simpson,"Dammit, I said full power!"
Lisa Simpson,Dad? Dad?
Homer Simpson,I'll take it.
Marge Simpson,"This chair is $2,000. We could buy a whole living room set for that."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer."
Marge Simpson,This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
Homer Simpson,"All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky."
,
Ned Flanders,Yes?
HERB,"Oh... uh... sorry, I must have the wrong house."
Ned Flanders,"Ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend."
Ned Flanders,Aren't we in luck? Today's our tithe day and we've got ourselves a transient. Come in my friend. Let us feed and bathe you.
HERB,Hey wait a minute...
Todd Flanders,"Dad, can I anoint the sores on his feet?"
Ned Flanders,"I think it's Mom's turn, son."
Todd Flanders,"Ah, no fair."
,
HERB,Thanks for the suit.
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you ever want to spend the night, Maude and I can sleep on card tables."
Todd Flanders,ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS...
Todd Flanders,"""MARCHING AS TO WAR, ETC..."""
,
Homer Simpson,They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf.
HERB,"What am I gonna say? This is the guy who ruined me. But on the other hand, he's family. So many conflicting emotions. How to express them..."
Lisa Simpson,Unky Herb!
HERB,Bart... Lisa. I'm so glad to see you.
Homer Simpson,You weren't so glad to see me.
HERB,"I'm sorry, Homer. But I'm still mad at you. Every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face."
Homer Simpson,"Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
HERB,"I'll try, but I'm not making any promises."
Marge Simpson,Herb! How have you been?
HERB,"I've been living in a cardboard box, sleeping on grates, eatin' out of dumpsters. You?"
Marge Simpson,Can't complain.
Homer Simpson,"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode."
Homer Simpson,On... off... on... off.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, he knows how to work a light switch."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does."
,
,
HERB,"This is really great, Marge."
Marge Simpson,I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
Homer Simpson,They do good work.
Bart Simpson,"Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?"
HERB,Discarded pizza boxes are an inexpensive source of cheese.
HERB,"Lisa, aren't you happy to see me?"
Lisa Simpson,"Why didn't you write, Unky Herb?"
HERB,"Hey if I wrote to you what was I supposed to say? ""Dear Lisa, last night I used a rat for a pillow thanks to your pop."
Lisa Simpson,I see your point.
HERB,WHETHER YOU'RE DRIVING NEAR OR FAR / POWELL MAKES A POW-POW-POWERFUL CAR!
HERB,"Maggie, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You're gonna make me rich again. Yes-oo are! Yes-oo are!"
HERB,"One, two, three... Ventnor Avenue."
Lisa Simpson,"And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
HERB,Get to the point.
Lisa Simpson,Eleven hundred and fifty bones.
HERB,That's all I got.
Homer Simpson,"Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Maybe we should play another game.
Bart Simpson,Why are we playin' games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I think we should invest in a set of the great books of Western Civilization. Look at this ad from ""New Republic for Kids."" Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""Paradise Regained,"" ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" or Herman Melville's twin classics ""Omoo"" and ""Typee""."
Homer Simpson,"Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
Marge Simpson,That was your idea.
Bart Simpson,"I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
HERB,How would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, wait. Herb, what're you talking about?"
HERB,Up-up-up-up. Not here. Come into the dining room. I want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
Homer Simpson,Twenty minutes?!
HERB,"Okay. Now, before I tell you about my idea, I'd like to show you this."
Homer Simpson,It's drinking the water!
HERB,"Take it easy, Homer. Now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed..."
Homer Simpson,This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
HERB,"No, Homer. That invention is out already. I'm just using it as an example."
Homer Simpson,It's going back for more!
Homer Simpson,
HERB,"Homer, this is my invention."
HERB,"Now, of course, with these blueprints you'll have to use your imagination."
Lisa Simpson,Maggie! Maggie!
HERB,"It's a baby translator. It measures the pitch, the frequency, and the urgency of a baby's cries. Then it tells whoever's around -- in plain English -- exactly what the baby is trying to say. Everything from ""Change me"" to ""turn off that damn Raffi record."""
Marge Simpson,That's a very clever idea!
HERB,All I need is a couple thousand dollars to build a prototype. You'll have your money back in thirty days. I swear.
Lisa Simpson,I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother."
Homer Simpson,"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
HERB,Nope.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird."
HERB,"Now, let's see... What could you be trying to say? Nothing downstairs... You just took a nap..."
HERB,I want to suck your nose.
HERB,Ooga booga! Ooga booga!
HERB,I'm scared.
HERB,"Hmm... the amplitude of the sine wave is insufficient for ""Burp Me"", and this saw-tooth formation is something I've never..."
HERB,Eureka.
HERB,"Now, I bet you're all wondering what lies under this sheet."
Bart Simpson,Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john.
HERB,"Oh. Well, here it is again. My ""Baby Translator!"""
Marge Simpson,Whoooa!!
HERB,"Marge, you don't have to humor me."
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's pretty ingrained."
HERB,"What do you think, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
HERB,"Homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!"
Homer Simpson,"I try, but I can't."
Herb Powell,Lavish attention on me and entertain me.
Marge Simpson,"Maggie, you talked!"
HERB,You see! It tells you exactly what's on the baby's mind.
Homer Simpson,Never mind.
Herb Powell,Where did you go?
Lisa Simpson,Peek-a-boo!
Herb Powell,"Oh, there you are. Very amusing."
HERB,"Well, Homer, now what do you think?"
Homer Simpson,"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these."
Herb Powell,I have soiled myself. How embarrassing.
Homer Simpson,I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. He is your brother."
Homer Simpson,"Well, when is he gonna act like it?"

Professor Jonathan Frink,"This radio controlled plane gives your baby the chance to fly, just like my son here. He can execute the barrel roll... loop-de-loop... then bring it in for the perfect landing."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Whoop, oh dear. My wife is going to kill me."
,
Herb Powell,I only want to eat candy!
Mom,Then that's all you'll get.
Herb Powell,This leash demeans us both.
Woman,I'll take two.
Man,I'll take a dozen!
Man #2,"I represent the ""Precious Baby Discount Stores"". I'll take 50,000."
HERB,I'm rich again! USA! USA! USA!
,
HERB,"Homer, here's a check for two-thousand dollars. But I also wanted to give you each a little something for believing in me. Lisa, this is the first volume of The Great Books of Western Civilization. You'll receive a new one every month. From ""Beowulf"" to ""Less Than Zero."""
Lisa Simpson,"Finally, a copy of ""Ethan Frome"" to call my own."
HERB,"Now Bart, I know you're too young for the machine gun you wanted. But I'm gonna give you something that'll make sure when you're old enough you can still buy one. A membership in the National Rifle Association."
Bart Simpson,"Wow! The NRA. Can I be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets, too?"
HERB,"It's in the Constitution, son."
HERB,"Maggie, who brought me my fortune I'll give you anything you want in this world."
Herb Powell,I want what the dog's eating.
Homer Simpson,
HERB,I'll get you somethin' nice. Now Marge...
Marge Simpson,"Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but I don't need any gift from you."
HERB,"You're too late, Marge. I got you a new washer and dryer. And I sold the old ones for fifty bucks."
,
Barney Gumble,Come on washer!
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, you stupid dryer!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
HERB,"Homer, walk me to my car."
Homer Simpson,"What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it."
HERB,"This is what you get, Homer. I forgive you. You can call me brother and I can do the same."
Homer Simpson,That's it?
HERB,That's it.
Homer Simpson,"I see your point, brother."
HERB,"Gimme a hug, brother."
Homer Simpson,All right... but I never really hugged a man before.
HERB,"Homer, I bought you the damn chair."
HERB,That's enough already. Get outta here!

Edna Krabappel,"Well, children, it's the last day of school."
Edna Krabappel,Here are your grades.
Bart Simpson,"Oh no, Mrs. Krabappel. If I don't get a C average, my Dad won't let me go to Kamp Krusty."
Edna Krabappel,"Well, it isn't fair to the other children, but, all right."
Bart Simpson,"Much obliged, doll."

Homer Simpson,Well it is.
Bart Simpson,"Oh how do I know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?"
Bart Simpson,"You know, a pinch is more traditional."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, you do remember your promise to the children?"
Homer Simpson,"Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door."
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, you're looking at one happy camper."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes: D,B,A,C."
Homer Simpson,"Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty."
Bart Simpson,But Dad...

Lisa Simpson,"Oh Miss Hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. You gave me a B+ in conduct."
Miss Hoover,"Now Lisa, everyone needs a blotch on their permanent record."
Lisa Simpson,Perhaps I'm not making myself clear. I think you should reconsider.

Bart Simpson,You mean I can go?
Homer Simpson,Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, Dad. You're the best father a boy could ever have!"
Homer Simpson,"Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
Bart Simpson,"Ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty."

Kids,"Burn, Krusty, burn. Burn, Krusty, burn."
Kent Brockman,A group of school-age Spartacuses has taken this camp by force. Three counselors are missing and presumed scared. What's that? I'm being told I can have an exclusive interview with the ring leader.
,
HOMER'S THOUGHT,Don't be the boy. Don't be the boy.

Bart Simpson,"I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. Can I say ""crappy"" on TV?"
Kent Brockman,"Yes, on this network you can."

Kent Brockman,Are you and Princess Di just friends?

Krusty the Clown,"I don't know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year."
Bart Simpson,I smell bacon. Let's see if he's wearing a wire.
Lisa Simpson,"It is the real Krusty. Look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, at least you're not as bad as customs."
Bart Simpson,"How could you, Krusty? I'd never lend my name to an inferior product."
Krusty the Clown,They drove a dump truck full of money up to my house. I'm not made of stone!
Bart Simpson,"Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
Krusty the Clown,Oh my God.
Bart Simpson,"Well actually, the bear just ate his hat."
Krusty the Clown,Was it a nice hat?
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah.

Chief Wiggum,I would.
Llewellyn Sinclair,"Stanley, you're, you're pulsing with animal lust. You take Blanche and fling her roughly to the bed."
Ned Flanders,Roger-dodger.

Homer Simpson,"Marge, your ride's here."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!"
Ned Flanders,You're a dame and I'm a fella.
Marge Simpson,"Stanley stop, or I'll tell Stella."

Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?"
Llewellyn Sinclair,Oh here!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's quarters in here!"
Marge Simpson,I just don't see what's so bad about Stanley.

Homer Simpson,"Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
Marge Simpson,What kooky projects?
Homer Simpson,"You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing."
Marge Simpson,Why didn't you tell me you felt this way?

Homer Simpson,"Ah, my beloved family. How was church?"
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church!"
Marge Simpson,"That's a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
Homer Simpson,"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again."
Marge Simpson,Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith?
Homer Simpson,"No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes."
,
Marge Simpson,"I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?"
Bart Simpson,"Amen, brother."
Homer Simpson,And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
Bart Simpson,"Tell it, daddy!"
Homer Simpson,And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
Bart Simpson,Testify!
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. Please show him the error of his ways."

Homer Simpson,It's good for what ails ya...
Homer Simpson,I can wait all --
Homer Simpson,God?
God,THOU HAST FORSAKEN MY CHURCH!
Homer Simpson,Well... kind of... but...
God,BUT WHAT?
Homer Simpson,And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17.
Homer Simpson,I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?
God,"Hmm, you've got a point there."
God,"You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football. Does St. Louis still have a team?"
Homer Simpson,No. They moved to Phoenix.
God,Oh yeah.
Homer Simpson,You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
God,I couldn't agree more. That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me. I think I'll give him a canker sore.
Homer Simpson,Give him one for me.
God,I will.
Homer Simpson,"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
God,"Homer, it's a deal. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear on a tortilla in Mexico."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
Homer Simpson,"Sure, honey."
Lisa Simpson,Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed."
Homer Simpson,"Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you."
Homer Simpson,"Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?"
Marge Simpson,"Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,What?!
Marge Simpson,"No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, really?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge."
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"So, Homer, you saw the Big Cheese? What'd he look like?"
Homer Simpson,Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you're crazy. Tell him this is all crazy."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Homer, I'd like you to remember Matthew 7:26 -- ""The foolish man, who built his house on sand."""
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"""And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there""?"
Homer Simpson,Yeah... think about it.

Marge Simpson,"Let's go, kids."
Bart Simpson,How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons?
Marge Simpson,"I have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked."
Homer Simpson,"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"
Marge Simpson,"Kids, could you wait outside for us?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. Don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win."
Homer Simpson,There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...
Marge Simpson,I'm only going to ask you one last time. Are you sure you won't come with us to church?
Announcer,"Coming up next, ""Make Your Own Ladder."""
Homer Simpson,Very sure.

Homer Simpson,"Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Please do not offer my god a peanut.
Homer Simpson,"No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Mr. Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and come again."

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Pride goeth before destruction!

Homer Simpson,"Boy, everyone is stupid except me."

Ned Flanders,"Homer, God didn't set your house on fire."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No, but he was working in the hearts of your friends and neighbors when they went to your aid, be they Christian... Jew... or Miscellaneous..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Hindu. There are 700 million of us.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, that's super."
Homer Simpson,"I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad to hear you say that."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, would you give church another try?"
Homer Simpson,"I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!"

Lisa Simpson,I'm tired of being a corporate shill.
Lisa Simpson,From now I will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Before I sing the National Anthem, I'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts."
Football Player,Let's get outta here!
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Gentlemen, we need to get Lisa Simpson out, and Amber Dempsy back in. But this glorified-crossing-guard-of-a-Police Chief won't get off his big fat can."
Chief Wiggum,Is it okay if I open these potato chips?
Jack Larson,"Gentlemen, our prayers have been answered. Take a look at our Little Miss Springfield's pageant application."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Roxy, bring in a bottle of champagne."
Chief Wiggum,And some dip for these chips... somethin'.
Kent Brockman,Lisa Simpson is no longer Little Miss Springfield. She was stripped of her crown in a ceremony earlier today.
Kent Brockman,"Well, that's obviously the wrong footage. Uh, but it does seem the father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson, filled out the pageant application incorrectly. In the area under ""Do not write in the space"" he wrote ""okay."""
,
Homer Simpson,If it wasn't for me you'd still be queen. You must hate me.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know. Was I drunk?
Lisa Simpson,"Possibly. But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. And I do."
Homer Simpson,Really?
Lisa Simpson,Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson,Will you remember this the next
Homer Simpson,time I wreck your life?
Lisa Simpson,It's a deal.
Kent Brockman,"And now, my exclusive interview with his Holiness, Pope John Paul II."

Grampa Simpson,"Happy birthday, Bart."
,
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Grampa."
Marge Simpson,Where'd you get all the money?
Grampa Simpson,"The government. I didn't earn it. I don't need it. But if they miss one payment, I'll raise hell."
Bart Simpson,Hey Homer - where's your present?
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? With what?
Homer Simpson,"I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave..."
Grampa Simpson,Hey!
Homer Simpson,I will get you one now!
,
,
Homer Simpson,Do you sell toys?
Shopkeeper,We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. We also sell frozen yogurt... which I call frogurt!
Homer Simpson,"Well, I need something for my son's birthday."
Shopkeeper,Perhaps this will please the gentleman.
Shopkeeper,"Take this object. But beware, it carries a terrible curse."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's bad."
Shopkeeper,But it comes with a free frogurt.
Homer Simpson,That's good.
Shopkeeper,The frogurt is also cursed.
Homer Simpson,That's bad.
Shopkeeper,But you get your choice of topping.
Homer Simpson,That's good.
Shopkeeper,The toppings contain potassium benzoate.
Shopkeeper,That's bad.
Homer Simpson,Can I go now?
,
Homer Simpson,"Happy birthday, son!"
Bart Simpson,Great Caesar's Ghost! A talking Krusty doll!
Krusty Doll,I'm Krusty the Clown and I love you very much.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I've ever had."
Grampa Simpson,"That doll is evil, I tells ya. Evil! EEEVIL!"
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, you said that about all the presents."
Grampa Simpson,I just want attention.
Kent Brockman,"...And in environmental news, scientist have announced that Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Krusty Doll,I'm Krusty the Clown and I don't like you.
Homer Simpson,
Krusty Doll,I'm Krusty the Clown and I'm going to kill you!
Homer Simpson,Didn't even pull the string that time.
Krusty Doll,"I said I'm going to kill you. You, Homer Simpson."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what's wrong?"
Homer Simpson,That doll tried to kill me!
Bart Simpson,"I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure?"
Homer Simpson,Don't leave me alone with him.
Homer Simpson,MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT'S H-O-M-E-R.
Homer Simpson,
Patty Bouvier,There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality.
Krusty Doll,"Hey, baby. Get comfortable. Relax. It's a little hot for that cheerleader outfit, don't you think?"
Krusty Doll,You think your dirty socks can stop me? Well... they are making me dizzy...

Gangster,"Arrivederci, Vito."

Krusty Doll,Here ya' go buddy.
Homer Simpson,Did you walk the dog?
Krusty Doll,"Yeah, he buried me a couple a times."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk."
Krusty Doll,"Yeah, you stupid idiot."

Krusty Doll,"Oh, what a day. Homer made me give him a sponge bath. But coming home to you makes it all worth while."
Krusty Doll,"Here, let me get that for ya."
,
Homer Simpson,"... So then, his wife comes through the door!!!"
Bart Simpson,So?
Homer Simpson,Did I mention she was dead?
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club!"
Bart Simpson,And?
Homer Simpson,Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
Lisa Simpson,You said he went bowling!
Homer Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,"Homer, I've coughed up scarier stuff than that."

Carl Carlson,Apes. But they're not so big.
Otto Mann,"Hey, who's this Homer Dude?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"He's either a fifty foot prehistoric ape, or a tourist trap concocted by the ape island jaycees. Either way, we're going ashore."
Marge Simpson,Am I going too?
Grampa Simpson,Garsh darn it.

Marge Simpson,"Thank you, dear. Now be good for Grampa while we're at the parent/ teacher meeting. We'll bring back dinner."
Lisa Simpson,What are we going to have?
Homer Simpson,Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.

Bart Simpson,Poison pizza.
Homer Simpson,Oh no. I'm not making two stops.

Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!
Marge Simpson,We're talking about Bart.
Homer Simpson,Oh. That guy.
Edna Krabappel,I think the problem here is discipline. If Bart does something wrong you should punish him.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
Homer Simpson,He's the boy you love to hate.
Edna Krabappel,"Well, you've got to start being firm with him. I believe with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming... oh... say Chief Justice of the Supreme Court."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right. Like you're gonna let me go hungry. I'll be eatin' that pizza in five minutes."
Homer Simpson,Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger.

Marge Simpson,"Well, we brought some pizza."
Grampa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,If you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.
Grampa Simpson,You already put me in a home.
Homer Simpson,"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""
Grampa Simpson,I'll be good.
Grampa Simpson,Look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!
Homer Simpson,"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
Marge Simpson,Now this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about. Our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present."
Marge Simpson,"Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?"
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, this is gonna be sweet."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, no."
Grampa Simpson,Oh.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
Marge Simpson,Bart! Stop being confident.
Bart Simpson,There must be something to eat around here.
Bart Simpson,"Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess I'd better straighten up and fly..."

Bart Simpson,Indeed I did.
Homer Simpson,"Hey you goats, get outta here!"
Homer Simpson,"Boy, you're going to have to be punished for this."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you could punish me. But that means you'd have to think of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it..."
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms.
Bumblebee Man,"Ayy, el estomago!"
Homer Simpson,"Run along, ya little scamp."
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Jin-gle Bells, Jin-gle Bells..."
Homer Simpson,Bart! Why are you doing that?
Bart Simpson,I'unno.

Homer Simpson,"No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute..."
Homer Simpson,Ice cream truck!
Homer Simpson,"Me, me. I was here first!"
Homer Simpson,"Now, what were we talking about, boy?"
Bart Simpson,Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
Marge Simpson,We're home.
Lisa Simpson,We got beets!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, are you pulling up the carpet?"
Bart Simpson,Yuh - huh.
Marge Simpson,Why are you letting him do this?
Homer Simpson,I'unno.
Marge Simpson,Well punish him!
Homer Simpson,"All right. All right. Bart, go to your room."
Bart Simpson,See ya in the funny pages.
Marge Simpson,How could you let this happen?
Homer Simpson,How could you let this happen?
Marge Simpson,I wasn't here!
Homer Simpson,Oh. How convenient.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, do you want your son to become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper?"
Homer Simpson,Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?
Marge Simpson,Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.
Homer Simpson,Now who's being naive.
Marge Simpson,"Look, you have to help discipline your son."
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick."
Kent Brockman,"Tonight on Eye On Springfield, we meet a man who's been hiccuping for forty-five years."
Man,Kill me... Kill me...
Kent Brockman,But first we'll examine the growing Itchy & Scratchy mania with their new movie premiering today!
Bart Simpson,I got my ticket.
Kent Brockman,"I'm here live in Korea to give you a first hand look at how American cartoons are made. But first, let's take a look back at the year 1928. A year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole."
Kent Brockman,"It was also the year of the very first Scratchy cartoon, entitled ""That Happy Cat""."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, but the punishment stands."
Kent Brockman,"The film did very poorly. But the following year Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy. And cartoon history was made. Here's their first cartoon together: ""Steamboat Itchy."""
Itchy,"Oh me, oh my!"
Kent Brockman,During the war Itchy & Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe.
Kent Brockman,We'll be back with a real life Itchy & Scratchy. A rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?"
Bart Simpson,Sounds like something you'd say.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, where is she?"
,
,
Marge Simpson,Oh my Lord!
,
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, isn't that cute. A baby driving a car."
Chief Wiggum,"And look, there's a dog driving a bus."
Driver,Hey!
Snake Jailbird,All rrright. Time for a crime spree.
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!"
Bart Simpson,"Come on, Homer. This isn't funny."
Homer Simpson,"Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!"
Bart Simpson,
Snake Jailbird,"Oh, nnnooo. Beta."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you gotta let me see that movie. Can't you just give me a spanking?"
Bart Simpson,"Come on, go nuts."
Homer Simpson,Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
Homer Simpson,Hmm...
,
,
Homer Simpson,"YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU..."
Homer Simpson,"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING..."
Guy,I regret nothing!
Homer Simpson,"Someday you'll thank me for this, son."
Bart Simpson,Not bloody likely.
Homer Simpson,"No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, what's the point of this story?"
Homer Simpson,I like stories.
Bart Simpson,"Look, can I please go to the movie?"
Homer Simpson,"I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV."
Bart Simpson,TV sucks.
Homer Simpson,"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that."
,
Announcer,The master craftsman can make three mailboxes an hour.
Bart Simpson,"I'm not licked yet. I can entertain myself. No matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,How was it?
Lisa Simpson,It wasn't that great.
Bart Simpson,Be honest.
Lisa Simpson,"It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. And you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos. Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson... of course they didn't use their real names, but you could tell it was them."
Bart Simpson,Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,Sorry Bart.
,
Bart Simpson,It's just not the same.
Milhouse Van Houten,I've seen the Itchy & Scratchy Movie 13 times.
Nelson Muntz,I've seen it 17 times.
Bart Simpson,You guys must be gettin' pretty tired of that movie by now.
Milhouse Van Houten,No one who saw the movie would say that!
Nelson Muntz,Let's get him!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we'd like to talk to you."
Homer Simpson,But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you've got to let Bart see that movie. I've never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine."
Homer Simpson,Don't you think I know that?
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's been two months. You laid down the law and I'm proud of you. But I think we've gotten through to him."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen."
,
Bart Simpson,"One for ""Itchy and Scratchy""."
Booth Attendant,We promised your dad we wouldn't.
,
,
Kent Brockman,"I'm here at the Springfield Aztec Theater where, after eight months and nine Academy Awards, the Itchy and Scratchy movie is showing for the last time. Tomorrow, a new movie, starring Liza Minnelli and Mickey Rourke will open. Will it be as successful? Only time will tell."
Bart Simpson,"Well, Dad, I guess you won."
Homer Simpson,"No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special."
,
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'll be. The Itchy and Scratchy Movie."
Bart Simpson,Come on. What d'ya say?
Homer Simpson,All right. I think you've learned your lesson.
Bart Simpson,One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Homer Simpson,I'll get it son.
Booth Attendant,That'll be six hundred and fifty dollars.
Homer Simpson,
,
Customer,One Soylent Green. Hold the butter.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Soylent Green.
Homer Simpson,Which one's the mouse?
Bart Simpson,Itchy.
Homer Simpson,Itchy's a jerk.
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
,
Marge Simpson,"Resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of ""Lemon Time""..."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, give it here."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's dish washing liquid!"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
Marge Simpson,Oooh! They're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
Homer Simpson,I wish I could retire.
Homer Simpson,"Boy, that'd be sweet."
Ned Flanders,"Howdy-do, neighbor! Good pipe weather. Thought I'd fire up the briar."
Homer Simpson,Can't talk -- busy.
Ned Flanders,Okely-dokely-do.
Marge Simpson,Did you notice how slanted he looked?
Homer Simpson,All part of God's great plan.
Marge Simpson,I think one side of our house is sinking.
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Homer Simpson,The half-assed approach to foundation repair.
MCCLURE,"Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such instructional videos as ""Mothballing Your Battleship"" and ""Dig Your Own Grave - and Save!"" Now over the next six hours I'll be taking you through the do's and do not do's of foundation repair. Ready?"
Homer Simpson,Ready!
MCCLURE,"First, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel..."
Homer Simpson,"Hand me my patching trowel, boy."
Homer Simpson,Hmm.
MCCLURE,"Now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation?"
Homer Simpson,No.
MCCLURE,Good. Assemble the aluminum J-channel using self-furring screws. Install.
Homer Simpson,Wha-do I do...
MCCLURE,After applying brushable coating to the panels...
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...
MCCLURE,....you'll need some corrosion-resistant metal stucco lath.
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...
MCCLURE,If you can't find metal stucco lath....
Homer Simpson,Uh huh?
MCCLURE,Use carbon-fiber stucco lath.
Homer Simpson,
MCCLURE,"Now, parge the lath..."
Homer Simpson,Did you see the bubble?
Waylon Smithers,A CERTAIN MAN...
Girls,A CERTAIN MAN...
Contractor,"I'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking. I figure it's gonna cost you... oh, eighty-five hundred."
Homer Simpson,Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!
Homer Simpson,"Let's see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are..."
Kent Brockman,"... Leaving the Vice President in charge. And now, Leaning Tower of Pisa eat your heart out and move over! This is one story that's not on the level!"
Bart Simpson,"Behold the horrors of the Slanty Shanty. See the twisted creatures that dwell within. Meet ""Cue Ball,"" the man with no hair!"
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Woman,He's hideous!
Marge Simpson,We have to do something...
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
Marge Simpson,I could get a job.
Homer Simpson,Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
Homer Simpson,"March 15... I wish I'd brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV."
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, I think you have to keep your job too."
Homer Simpson,

C. Montgomery Burns,Burns!
Marley,Do you mind if I say a few words?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, me, me, me ""I need all the attention just because it's my party, eh!"""
Marley,"Please don't make me retire! My job is the only thing that keeps me alive! I never married, and my dog is dead!"
Marley,I'm not finished.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes you are."
C. Montgomery Burns,"With the departure of Mr. Marley, there will now be an entry-level position open in Sector 7G. Now get out. The bar is closed."
Crowd,
,
Marge Simpson,Maybe I should apply for that job.
,
Marge Simpson,"Where does the Bible say ""racket?""...."
Homer Simpson,"It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad."
Marge Simpson,"Well, Lisa, I finished my resume."
Lisa Simpson,Uh... I think it needs a little padding.
Marge Simpson,What are you putting in there?...
Lisa Simpson,Up-up-up. When I'm done.
Marge Simpson,Chauffeur... seamstress...
Marge Simpson,curator of large mammals?
Homer Simpson,Marge have you seen my lunch box?

Lisa Simpson,"Mom, they expect you to lie a little."
Marge Simpson,Worked for the Carter administration?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, you voted for him... twice!"
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, sh! Someone may be listening."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Oh, I thought Muddy Waters wrote that song."
Waylon Smithers,This resume is very impressive. Let me be the first to say: Kadibu [kadeeboo] Kazini [kazeenee].
Marge Simpson,What?
Waylon Smithers,Welcome aboard. I guess my Swahili's not as good as yours.
Marge Simpson,Yeah...
Waylon Smithers,"Sorry, the position has been filled."
Marley,Oh dear.
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home..."
Homer Simpson,"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now."
Marge Simpson,"We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, lemonade is good."
Lisa Simpson,I think it's wonderful. Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant. You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
Homer Simpson,Wha dey do?
Lisa Simpson,They discovered radium. Then they both died of radiation poisoning.
Bart Simpson,Hmmm!
Man,It's the Curies. We must flee!
Bart Simpson,Cool!
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt ."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Maggie, your baby-sitter's here."
Grampa Simpson,What's that mean?
Grampa Simpson,"Whoa, you must be sick."

Waylon Smithers,"And this is your office. That idiot Tibor lost the key, but you can jimmy it open with a credit card."
Waylon Smithers,"Well, have fun."
Marge Simpson,But... what do I do?
Waylon Smithers,"Marge, please. According to your resume, you invented this machine."

Edna Krabappel,"Put away your books, children. It's time for your English test."
Bart Simpson,Sick... on test day... Why? Whyyy?
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, have you ever read ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf""?"
Bart Simpson,"I'm halfway through it, I swear!"
Edna Krabappel,
,
Homer Simpson,Marge what're you doing? It's lunch time.
Marge Simpson,I'll just be a minute. I have to finish this paperwork.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under ""R"" for arrivederci."
Marge Simpson,"But, where does it go?"
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Good news, boy. I found a pharmacy that carries leeches! Well, it wasn't exactly a pharmacy... more of a bait shop."
Bart Simpson,"Look, Grampa, I'm fine! I really don't need any more home remedies."
Grampa Simpson,"Oral thermometer, my eye! Think warm thoughts, boy, 'cause this is mighty cold."
Bart Simpson,Aaaagh!

C. Montgomery Burns,Jackanapes... lolligaggers... noodle heads... enchantress!

Marge Simpson,Ow!
C. Montgomery Burns,Too close.
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello!
Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns,No need for alarm. I just came to give you the orchids and fragrant bath oils I lavish upon all my employees.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, aren't you nice. Gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low."
Man #2,I am the angel of death. The time of purification is at hand.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, who cares. Marge, what can we do?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You mean like ""Child labor Day""?"
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, actually, I was thinking of ""Funny Hat Day."""
C. Montgomery Burns,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, and how about piping in some Tom Jones music? That always cheers me up."
C. Montgomery Burns,It's working! It's working! And the healthy snacks are on their way.
Homer Simpson,You can't take our donuts!
Donut Man,"All right, anyone else want to be a hero?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Marge, I'm giving you a raise and a new office... right next to mine."
Waylon Smithers,"But, sir, that's my office!"

Grampa Simpson,"Bart, is that light green?"
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Grampa Simpson,It better be!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, what's wrong?"
Homer Simpson,I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.
Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.
Marge Simpson,Oh really? I came to see you three times today. Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?"
Waylon Smithers,"You've been reading my Wish Book, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, Smithers, I want you to arrange a party for two at my estate. Marge, me, and do you think you could dig up Al Jolson?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, you remember we did that once before?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's right, he's dead. And rather pungent. The rest of that night is something I'd like to forget. All right, then. Bring me that crooner she likes so much... Tom Jones."
Carl Carlson,These spurs are killin' me.
Lenny Leonard,Ayyy -- sit on it.
Carl Carlson,"Lenny, 50's Day is next Wednesday."
Lenny Leonard,I gotta go home and change!

Marge Simpson,Here's your money.
Contractor,You know the problem here was water leakage. If you just buy a fifty cent washer --
Homer Simpson,I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
Contractor,"Look, I've got some washers in my truck. I'll give you one."
,
Waylon Smithers,Tom Jones?
Tom Jones,Yes?
Waylon Smithers,I was wondering if you'd be interested in performing at a private party.
Tom Jones,"Sorry, Mate, I don't do private parties."
Waylon Smithers,"Then, perhaps you should look in this suitcase."
Tom Jones,"All right, but I don't see..."
Tom Jones,
Waylon Smithers,"Pleasant dreams, Mr. Jones."
,
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, to avoid this test you've had smallpox, the bends and that unfortunate bout of rabbies."
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'm not sure I'm over it. Shove it, witch."
Edna Krabappel,No more excuses!
Bart Simpson,

Krusty the Clown,Her claws are really digging into my skull.
Animal Handler,She can crush clams with them.
Krusty the Clown,"Get it off, get it off!"
Animal Handler,Here we have an Alaskan Timber Wolf. He weighs 240 pounds and his jaws can bite through a parking meter. He does get spooked by loud noises.
Krusty the Clown,Loud? That's our secret word for the day!
Animal Handler,Oh my God!
Krusty the Clown,
Animal Handler,She must think you're after her eggs.
Krusty the Clown,I only ate one!

Edna Krabappel,You're wasting valuable test time.
,
Marge Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you want to see me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, I was wondering if you were free for a little get-together tonight. Dinner, dancing and ... Mr. Tom Jones."
Tom Jones,"Hello, Marge."

Marge Simpson,Oh my goodness!
Tom Jones,
Marge Simpson,My husband will be so excited.
C. Montgomery Burns,"You... have a husband? Yes, I can picture him now... rugged good looks... sweater knotted about his shoulders... curly locks shining in the sun like spun gold..."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Mr. Burns gave me another raise today."
Homer,The senile old fool.
C. Montgomery Burns,You're fired!
Marge Simpson,You can't fire me just because I'm married. I'm going to sue the pants off you.
C. Montgomery Burns,You don't have to sue me to get my pants off.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Hey, Wolfie, put down that hors d'oeuvre... It's time for the main course!"
Groundskeeper Willie,"Back to class, lad, nothin' to see here."
,
Bart Simpson,Here's my test.
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, I'm not even going to grade this until you tell me the truth about what happened out there."
Bart Simpson,"The truth is, there was no wolf. I faked the whole thing. I'm just going to lie on the floor now. Please don't let me swallow my tongue."
Edna Krabappel,"There, doesn't it feel better to tell the truth?"
Edna Krabappel,Oh dear.
,
Grampa Simpson,"All right, now boy, we've got to rub some garlic on you before the next full moon."
Groundskeeper Willie,Don't feel bad for losing. I was wrestlin' wolves back when you were at your mother's teat.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, Marge, look at all those flies buzzing around your head -- you're a mess, woman ."
,
Marge Simpson,"So, do you think I have a case?"
Lionel Hutz,"Mrs. Simpson, you're in luck. Your sexual harassment suit is just the thing I need to rebuild my shattered practice. Care to join me in a belt of scotch?"
Marge Simpson,It's 9:30 in the morning.
Lionel Hutz,"Yeah, but I haven't slept in days..."
Lionel Hutz,Last chance...
Lionel Hutz,"Oh, yeah."
,
Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Burns we've got witnesses, precedent and a paper trail a mile long."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, I have ten high-priced lawyers."
Lionel Hutz,
Homer Simpson,He left his briefcase. Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess that's it. People like us can't afford justice. Come on Homie, let's go before he fires you too."
Homer Simpson,"No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You love her, too."
Homer Simpson,Damn right!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life."

Sylvia Winfield,"Mr. Simpson, my husband and I have decided to move..."
Homer Simpson,"Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?"

Homer Simpson,Mmm... no.
Sylvia Winfield,"Second, could you please take in your jack-o-lanterns from past Halloweens."
Homer Simpson,Mmm... no.
Sylvia Winfield,And please cover your garbage. It's attracting wildlife.
Homer Simpson,"Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin' to you! Get off my lawn! Now!"
Homer Simpson,

Homer Simpson,"Homer, you're not listening!"
Marge Simpson,That medicine's not for you.
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
Marge Simpson,Gimme that.
Captain,"Ahoy, maties. Had your fill of tacos? Would ye sooner eat a bilge rat than another burger? Then come for all-you-can-eat seafood at the ""FRYIN' DUTCHMAN."""
Homer Simpson,
Captain,Is it more iced tea ye be needing?
Wife,Okay.
Captain,"Set sail for ""The Fryin' Dutchman."""
Homer Simpson,"Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant."
Marge Simpson,"But I think I'm allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions."
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, shrimp."
,
Woman,"Now, I don't know much about haggling or bargaining, so why don't we just agree to pay whatever the Winfields want?"

Man,What was that?
Price,Sigh.

Homer Simpson,"There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?"
Woman,Goodbye.
Price,
,
,
Lisa Simpson,I don't think we should be down here.
Bart Simpson,"Nervous, Lis? I don't blame you. This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son."
Lisa Simpson,Bart! The Winfields didn't have a son.
Bart Simpson,See that sock over there? It was his only friend.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Lisa. Here in the dark you won't need those eyes. Let me have them."

Marge Simpson,That's sweet.
Marge Simpson,"... and finally, Moe's Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""Welcome to Springfield."""
Mrs. Powers,"Thank you, this is all so nice. I actually had some doubts about moving to Springfield. Especially after that Time cover story, ""America's Worst City."""
Marge Simpson,You could see our house in that photo.
Mrs. Powers,Oh.
Marge Simpson,And this is for the man of the house... which I guess... is you.
Mrs. Powers,"I guess I should explain. Laura's father and I divorced two years ago. Oh, they're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career, career, career."
Homer Simpson,My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,I bet you don't know this one. How'd you like a Hertz Donut?
Bart Simpson,Oh.
Laura Powers,"Hurts, don't it?"
Homer Simpson,"...All you can eat, ha!"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, right. Do you know what a Wet Willie is?"
Laura Powers,Is it this?

Bart Simpson,I'll never wash this hand again.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, make Bart wash his hand."

Bart Simpson,Silence!
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Maybe it's time I wash my hand.

Mrs. Powers,I'll send Laura over to baby-sit as soon as she gets home.
Homer Simpson,"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around..."
Mrs. Powers,My divorce.
Homer Simpson,"That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing."
Lisa Simpson,Homer.
Mrs. Powers,"Well I know what you're thinking and the answer is yes, I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites."
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
Mrs. Powers,I'm not.
Homer Simpson,"Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?"
Mrs. Powers,Right.
Homer Simpson,I hear you loud and clear.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, are you taking a bath?"
Bart Simpson,Yes I am. And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
Lisa Simpson,"This wouldn't have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest."
Bart Simpson,"Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise."
Laura Powers,Cute. What do you guys want for dinner?

Guy #1,Sometimes I think you want to fail.
Guy #2,Shut up. Just shut up.

Waiter,Excellent choice... and for the gentleman?
Homer Simpson,All you can eat. All you can eat.
Waiter,"All right. When you're ready, take this plate over..."
Chef,"Please don't take the steam tray, sir."

Marge Simpson,Don Quixote?
Homer Simpson,"No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha."
Marge Simpson,Don Quixote.
Homer Simpson,No!
Marge Simpson,I really think that was the character's name... Don Quixote!
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll look it up.
Marge Simpson,"Well, who was it?"

Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film ""The Neverending Story."""
Homer Simpson,So you think I have a case?
Lionel Hutz,"Homer, I don't use the word ""hero"" very often. But you are the greatest hero in American history."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
Bart Simpson,I'm here to see my Grampa.
Old Man,"Here I am, sonny."
Bart Simpson,You're not my Grampa.
Old Man,"Ah, c'mon, give me a chance. Hey, can your grandfather do this?"
Grampa Simpson,"Bart! Ah, you remembered my birthday."
Bart Simpson,Huh? Oh. I sure did!... Here's a bus schedule.
Grampa Simpson,Wow! Fits right in my pocket!
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, I need some advice. Did you ever have a crush on an older woman?"
Grampa Simpson,"I had a crush on the oldest woman. One hundred and twenty years old, she was. Here's a picture of her delivering Eubie Blake."
Bart Simpson,What happened?
Grampa Simpson,"She fell in with that Guinness Book of Records crowd. Suddenly, she didn't have any time for me. I wore a 15 pound beard of bees for that woman, but it just wasn't enough."
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I have some questions about women."
Homer Simpson,Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
Homer Simpson,"..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Bart's at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did."
Marge Simpson,Are you sure...?
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?"
Homer Simpson,"Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!"
Homer Simpson,"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch..."
Bart Simpson,How can I get her to notice me?
Laura Powers,"Meet me at the treehouse, Bart. And come alone."

Laura Powers,Thanks for coming.
Bart Simpson,I please to aim.
Laura Powers,"I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone. I have a boyfriend."

Seymour Skinner,"Uh, you've been flushing for twenty minutes. Is there a problem?"
Jimbo Jones,"Uh no, Principal Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,"Very well, I'll continue to wait."
Bart Simpson,How can you like that guy?
Laura Powers,I don't know. Maybe 'cause he's an outlaw. You know that dead body they found behind the mayor's house?
Bart Simpson,Jimbo killed him?
Laura Powers,"No, but he poked him with a stick."
Jimbo Jones,"Hey Laura, Dr. Tongue has arrived."
Laura Powers,"That's him, Bart."
Jimbo Jones,Who's the dork?
Laura Powers,"Leave him alone, he's just a kid."
Bart Simpson,I'll show them who's just a kid.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, it's your bedtime. I laid out your jammy-jams."
Bart Simpson,

Homer Simpson,I married her!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please I just had eggs."
Lisa Simpson,"Good luck in your trumped-up law suit, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, that means a lot to me."
Laura Powers,"All right you guys, I want you in bed before Jimbo gets here."
Bart Simpson,What do you like about him? He's just a good-lookin' rebel who plays by his own rules.

Lionel Hutz,"Mrs. Simpson, what did you and your husband do after you were ejected from the restaurant?"
Marge Simpson,We pretty much went straight home.
Lionel Hutz,"Mrs. Simpson, you're under oath."
Marge Simpson,"We drove around until 3 a.m. looking for another ""All You Can Eat"" fish restaurant."
Lionel Hutz,And when you couldn't find one?
Marge Simpson,We went fishing.
Lionel Hutz,"Do these sound like the actions of a man who had... ""all he could eat?"""
Fat Foreman,That could've been me!
Captain,"I've a proposition for ye, fair and true."

Moe Szyslak,"Hey, just a sec, I'll check. Amanda Huggenkiss! Hey, I'm looking for Amanda Huggenkiss! Why can't I find Amanda Huggenkiss!"
Barney Gumble,Maybe your standards are too high.
Moe Szyslak,"You little S.O.B., if I ever find out who you are I'm gonna shove a sausage down your throat and stick starving dogs in your butt!"

Bart Simpson,My name is Jimbo Jones and I live at 1094 Evergreen Terrace.

Jimbo Jones,I don't believe it. Now my pants are chafin' me.
Moe Szyslak,"All right, who's Jimbo Jones?"
Jimbo Jones,I am.

Jimbo Jones,"Please, dude, don't hurt me. Oh man... ."

Moe Szyslak,Ow! Stupid wishing well.

Laura Powers,"Jimbo, I don't think we should see each other any more. You're just not the guy I thought you were."
Jimbo Jones,Can I have my shirt back?
Laura Powers,"Well, Bart, you were right about him."
Bart Simpson,As usual. A knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way.
Laura Powers,"You know, if you were only old enough to grow a bad teenage mustache, I'd go out with you in a second."
Bart Simpson,Wow...

Customer,Gimme some jerky.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Would you like some vodka with that?
Customer,"Oh, what the Hell, sure."
,
Nurse,"Doctor, what's wrong? Don't you know where to make the incision?"
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Alright Nick, don't panic. Think back to Med school."
,
Young Riviera,"Seriously baby, I can prescribe anything I want."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"I know I'm supposed to cut something, but what? And where?"
Lisa Simpson,Hey! The incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage. Below!
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Thanks, little girl."
Dr. Nick Riviera,THE KNEE BONE'S CONNECTED TO THE... SOMETHING. / THE SOMETHING'S CONNECTED TO THE... RED THING. / THE RED THING'S CONNECTED TO MY... WRISTWATCH... UH-OH.
,
Dr. Nick Riviera,Good news! The operation was a complete success.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's wonderful!"
Angry Man,Dr. Nick Riviera. Remember me?
Dr. Nick Riviera,Well if it isn't my old friend Mr. McGreg -- with a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg.
,
Lisa Simpson,"All right, Dad!"
Bart Simpson,You rule intensive care!
,
Homer Simpson,Yabba dabba doo!
Homer Simpson,"SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE"
,
Lenny Leonard,What do they do with these things after we seal 'em?
Carl Carlson,I hear they dump them in an abandoned chalk mine and cover 'em with cement.
Lenny Leonard,I hear they're sending 'em to one of those southern states where the governor's a crook.
Carl Carlson,Either way I'm sleepin' good tonight!
Waylon Smithers,"Well, sir, where shall we dump this batch -- the playground?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, all those bald children are arousing suspicion -- to the park!"
,
Waylon Smithers,"I think it's full, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's ridiculous, the last tree held nine drums."
Agent,"Agent Malone, Environmental Protection Agency. Some Boy Scouts stumbled on your little game of ""hide the ooze."""
,
Judge Snyder,"Mr. Burns, in light of your unbelievable contempt for human life, this court fines you three million dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, my wallet's in my right front pocket."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and uh, I'll take that statue of Justice too."
Judge Snyder,Sold!
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Andy Capp, you wife-beating drunk."
Marge Simpson,"Ohh, there's going to be a town meeting to decide how to spend Mr. Burns' money."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools."
,
Miss Hoover,"Children, it's time for your history lesson. Put on your virtual reality helmets."
Warrior,"Hm excellent. Hello, Lisa. I'm Genghis Khan. You'll go where I go. Defile what I defile. Eat who I eat. Hmm?"
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, Lis. We both know how this money should, nay, must be spent."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, we'll do anything you want. Just call off your giant mechanical ants!"
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of."
Homer Simpson,"Like a giant billboard that says, ""No fat chicks""?"
Marge Simpson,No.
,
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, it looks like everyone in Springfield showed up for this."
,
Snake Jailbird,Could this town be any stupider?
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,Ordah! Please rise for the a Pledge of Allegiance.
Homer Simpson,Get to the money!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"In a moment. First, let's review the minutes from our last meeting..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Get to the money!
Mayor Joe Quimby,Very well. We will now hear suggestions for the-a disbursement of the-a two million dollars.
Lisa Simpson,Don't you mean three million dollars?
Mayor Joe Quimby,Of course. How silly of me.
Maude Flanders,"Excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town."
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello. My name is Mr. Snrub, and I come from... eh, someplace far away. Yes, that will do. Anyway, I-I say we invest that money back in the nuclear plant."
Waylon Smithers,I like the way Snrub thinks.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Pardon me, but I would like to see this money spent on more police officers. I have been shot eight times this year, and as a result I almost missed work."
Chief Wiggum,Crybaby.
Marge Simpson,My name is Marge Simpson and I have an idea. It may sound a little boring at first...
Mayor Joe Quimby,Chat away. I'll just amuse myself with some pornographic playing cards.
Marge Simpson,Well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition Main Street is in.
Marge Simpson,Many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!"
Marge Simpson,And those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
Grampa Simpson,"Now hold on just one minute. Sure, we could fix up Main Street. We could put all our eggs in one basket..."
Grampa Simpson,"Shut up! I wasn't done yet. I'm just saying we could blow all our money on a stupid little street, but.."
Grampa Simpson,"I ain't fer it, I'm agin' it."
Crowd,Main Street! Main Street! Main Street!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"All those in favor of Grampa Simpsons' plan for re-building Main Street, please..."
LANLEY,"You know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!"
Homer Simpson,Heh-heh... mule.
LANLEY,"The name's Lanley. Lyle Lanley. And I come before you good people tonight with an idea. Probably the greatest... Ah, it's not for you. It's more of a ""Shelbyville"" idea."
Mayor Joe Quimby,Now wait just a minute. We're twice as smart as the people of Shelbyville. Just tell us your idea and we'll vote for it.
LANLEY,All right. I tell you what I'll do. I'll show you my idea.
LANLEY,I give you the Springfield Monorail!
LANLEY,"I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook and, by gum, it put them on the map!"
LANLEY,"Well, sir, there's nothing on earth like a genuine, bona-fide, electrified, six-car monorail. What'd I say?"
Ned Flanders,Monorail.
LANLEY,What's it called?
Selma Bouvier,Monorail!
LANLEY,"That's right, monorail!"
Miss Hoover,I hear those things are awfully loud.
LANLEY,It glides as softly as a cloud.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Is there a chance the track could bend?
LANLEY,"Not on your life, my Hindu friend."
Barney Gumble,What about us brain-dead slobs?
LANLEY,You'll be given cushy jobs.
Grampa Simpson,Were you sent here by the devil?
LANLEY,"No, good sir, I'm on the level."
Chief Wiggum,The ring came off my pudding can!
LANLEY,"Take my pen knife, my good man."
LANLEY,"I swear it's Springfield's only choice, throw up your hands and raise your voice."
Crowd,Monorail!
LANLEY,What's it called?
Crowd,Monorail!
LANLEY,Once again!
Crowd,Monorail!
Marge Simpson,But Main Street's still all cracked and broken.
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Mom, the mob has spoken."
Crowd,MONORAIL / MONORAIL / MONORAIL!
Homer Simpson,Mono...
,
Bart Simpson,Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!
Marge Simpson,I still think we should have spent the money to fix Main Street.
Homer Simpson,"Well, you should have written a song like that guy."
Marge Simpson,
,
Miss Hoover,"Thank you for coming, Mr. Lanley. I'm Miss Hoover."
LANLEY,Miss Hoover? That is hard to believe.
Miss Hoover,"Oh, you."
LANLEY,"Now, I'm here to answer any questions you children may have about the monorail."
Ralph Wiggum,Can it outrun The Flash?
LANLEY,You bet.
Chuck,Can Superman outrun The Flash?
LANLEY,"Eh, sure, why not? Hello, little girl, wondering if your dolly can ride the monorail for free?"
Lisa Simpson,Hardly. I'd like you to explain why we should build a mass transit system in a small town with a centralized population.
LANLEY,"Ha, ha. Young lady, that's the most intelligent question I've ever been asked."
Lisa Simpson,Really?
Bart Simpson,"Wow, Dad. You really know your monorails."
LANLEY,"Oh, I could give you an answer, but the only ones who'd understand it would be you and me... And that includes your teacher."
Lisa Simpson,
LANLEY,"Next question -- You there, eating the paste."
,
Announcer,"Coming soon, it's ""Truckosaurus, the Movie"" starring Marlon Brando as the voice of John Truckosaurus."
Truckosaurus,You crazy car. I don't know whether to eat you or kiss you.
Announcer,Celebrity voice impersonated.
LANLEY,Are you stuck in a dead-end job?
Homer Simpson,Maybe.
LANLEY,Are you squandering the precious gift of life in front of the idiot box?
Homer Simpson,What's it to ya?
LANLEY,Are you on your third beer of the evening?
Homer Simpson,Does whiskey count as beer?
LANLEY,"Well, maybe it's time you joined the exciting field of Monorail Conducting by enrolling at the Lanley Institute."
Announcer,Actual institute may not match photo.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want to be a monorail conductor."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, no..."
Homer Simpson,It's my life-long dream.
Marge Simpson,"Your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
,
LANLEY,"Good evening. Before we begin, is anyone here an investigative reporter?"
Reporter,"I am, and.. she is."
LANLEY,"Well, I'd like you to please leave."
Reporter,Should we take our hidden camera?
LANLEY,Would you?
Reporter,"Let's go, Phil."
,
Bart Simpson,True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail?
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe it's true."
Bart Simpson,"No, you were right, it's ""false."" Wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!"
Homer Simpson,"That's right, boy."
,
Bart Simpson,"You know, I used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job."
Homer Simpson,Heh-heh. Kids.
Bart Simpson,"But now, I want to follow in your footsteps."
Homer Simpson,Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju!
Bart Simpson,I'll get back to you.
,
Barney Gumble,"Come on... keep it comin'... over... over... mmm hmm... mmm hmm... Hi, Homer!"
Barney Gumble,I hate that sound.
,
Marge Simpson,"According to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. What if something goes wrong?"
Homer Simpson,"""What if?"" What if I'm taking a shower and I slip on a bar of soap? Oh, my God, I'd be killed!"
Marge Simpson,It frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
Homer Simpson,We monorail conductors are a crazy breed. Half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... Am I turning you on?
Marge Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,What if I undo this button?
Marge Simpson,"Goodnight, Homer."
Homer Simpson,What if I talk like this?
Homer Simpson,What if I SING TO YOU? I GAVE MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE/ Mmmm chicken.
,
LANLEY,"...so then, ""mono"" means ""one"" and ""rail"" means ""rail."" And that concludes our intensive three-week course."
Otto Mann,"Hey, wait, man. Who gets to be conductor?"
LANLEY,"Oh, right, that. Well, I've been monitoring your progress closely..."
LANLEY,But this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.
Homer Simpson,"Who, me?"
LANLEY,"Yeah, sure."
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!
Kent Brockman,"After an exhaustive search, Springfield has found its monorail conductor -- Homer Simpson."
,
Homer Simpson,"And this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake."
Homer Simpson,THE WICKED WITCH.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, there's a family of opossums in here!"
Homer Simpson,I call the big one Bitey.
Marge Simpson,I'm going to see Mr. Lanley.
,
Marge Simpson,Mr. Lanley? Mr. Lanley?
,
LANLEY,How much did you see?
Marge Simpson,Nothing incriminating.
LANLEY,Good.
Marge Simpson,"Well, bye."
LANLEY,I don't know why I leave this lying around.
,
LANLEY,"I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Is there a chance the track could bend?
Homer Simpson,I call the big one Bitey.
LANLEY,"I've sold momorails to Brockway, Odgenville and North Haverbrook."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Is there a chance the track could bend.
Homer Simpson,I call the big one Bitey.
,
Waitress,Go away! There ain't no monorail and there never was!
Sebastian Kobb,"Excuse me, Miss, you asked about the monorail?"
Marge Simpson,Who are you?
Sebastian Kobb,My name is Sebastian Kobb. Lanley hired me to build his monorail. He cut corners everywhere... bad wiring... faulty brakes... and the celebrity on the maiden voyage was Gallagher.
Sebastian Kobb,This is all that's left of one of the crappiest trains ever built.
Marge Simpson,"Mr. Kobb, what can we do?"
Sebastian Kobb,You just better have a damn good conductor.
,
Homer Simpson,I locked my keys in there. Get a rock.
,
Kent Brockman,"Ladies and gentlemen, nothing brings out the stars like the maiden voyage of a monorail. Everyone's here, from recently outed leading man, Dash Calhoun... to Krusty the Clown!"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, Hey."
Woman With Baby,"Krusty, why won't you answer my calls? You've never even seen our son!"
Baby,
Marge Simpson,Homer.
Kent Brockman,"Here's one of those loveable high-schoolers from TV's Springfield Heights, 90210. He's cool, he's sexy, he's thirty-four years old, let's hear it for Kyle Darren!"
Kent Brockman,"And here's country singing sensation, Lurleen Lumpkin, fresh from her latest stay at the Betty Ford clinic!"
Kent Brockman,What ya been up to Lurleen?
Lurleen Lumpkin,I spent last night in a ditch.
Kent Brockman,"How about that, folks?"
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Now, I'd like to turn things over to our Grand Marshal, Mr. Leonard Nimoy."
NIMOY,
NIMOY,I'd say this vessel could do at least warp five.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"And let me say, ""May the force be with you."""
NIMOY,Do you even know who I am?
Mayor Joe Quimby,I think I do. Weren't you one of the Little Rascals?
,
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Lanley! Aren't you gonna ride the monorail?
LANLEY,"Little lady, I'd love to. But I have to catch a plane."
Lisa Simpson,But the ride only takes a minute.
LANLEY,"Yeah, well my plane leaves in less than one minute."
LANLEY,His car SCREECHES off.
,
,
Homer Simpson,All aboard!
,
,
Marge Simpson,We're too late!
Sebastian Kobb,I shouldn't have stopped for that haircut. Sorry.
,
NIMOY,"Actually, you see the doors on Star Trek were not mechanical. We had a stagehand on either side who would pull the door open when he saw you approach."
Man,Uh-huh.
,
Homer Simpson,"Stick your head out the window, boy. It's the greatest!"
Bart Simpson,Yee-hawww!
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Can't you stop it, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,I'm trying my best.
Woman,The lever you have pulled -- brakes -- is not in service. Please make a note of it.
,
Marge Simpson,How fast are they going?
Homer Simpson,
Sebastian Kobb,"Well, judging by your husband's cowardly scream, 180 miles an hour."
Homer Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,Ahhh. It's making me dizzy. I'm gonna take a nap.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"All right, I'm in charge here."
Chief Wiggum,"Ah, run along, Quimby. I think they're dedicating a phone booth somewhere."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Watch it, you talking tub of donut batter."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, I got pictures of you, Quimby!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"You don't scare me. That could be anyone's ass. Now, beat it. I'm calling the shots."
Chief Wiggum,"I think that sash is cutting off the air to your brain. The town charter says in an emergency, I run the show."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well, we'll just see about that. Let's go to town hall."
Chief Wiggum,"Fine. Should we take one car, or should I follow you?"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, according to the charter, as Chief Constable I'm supposed to get a pig every month ""... and two comely lasses of virtue true."""
Mayor Joe Quimby,Keep the pig. How many broads do I get?
Chief Wiggum,"Hey. Hey, hey, let go! You're rippin' it."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"No, you are."
Chief Wiggum,"No, you are."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Let go, that's the charter."

Engineer #1,"Wait a minute, we can just shut off the power!"
Engineer #2,"No such luck, it's solar powered."
Engineer #1,Solar power. When will people learn?
,
,
NIMOY,A solar eclipse. The cosmic ballet goes on.
Man,Does anyone wanna switch seats?
Homer Simpson,I did it!
,
,
Homer Simpson,
Captain,"Folks, this is your captain speaking. Our nonstop flight to Tahiti will be making a brief layover in North Haverbrook."
LANLEY,"North Haverbrook? Where have I heard that name before? Oh, no. Oh, no!"
,
Haverbrook Man,There he is! Seat 3-F.
,
,
Krusty the Clown,Krusty wants out!
NIMOY,No. The world needs laughter.
,
Homer Simpson,"Are we gonna die, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but at least we'll take a lot of innocent people with us."
Marge Simpson,Homer? Homer?
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
Homer Simpson,Batman?
Marge Simpson,"No, he's a scientist."
Homer Simpson,Batman's a scientist.
Marge Simpson,It's not Batman!
Sebastian Kobb,I think I have a way to stop the train. You need to find an anchor of some sort.
,
Bart Anchor,"Think harder, Homer."
,
Homer Simpson,I'll take that.
,
Bart Simpson,Uh... Dad?
,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Now separating Siamese Twins is a long and costly procedure.
,
Captain Horatio McCallister,Arr. Ye call that an anchor?
,
,
Homer Simpson,Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you're a hero!"
Homer Simpson,"Yes, son. I'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was."
,
NIMOY,"Well, my work is done here."
Barney Gumble,"Whadaya mean, your work is done? You didn't do anything."
NIMOY,Didn't I?
,
Marge Simpson,And that was the only folly the people of Springfield ever embarked upon -- except for the Popsicle stick skyscraper... and the fifty foot magnifying glass... and that escalator to nowhere.

Homer Simpson,"Bart, warm up the car. We're going to Duff Gardens."
Lisa Simpson,Yayyy!
Homer Simpson,"Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?"
Lisa Simpson,We're under six!
Homer Simpson,"And I'm a college student! Heh, heh."
Marge Simpson,"Kids, I have some bad news. Your Great Aunt Gladys has... passed on."
Bart Simpson,"Gladys, Gladys... `bout yay high, blue hair, big dent in her forehead?"
Marge Simpson,"No honey, Gladys looked more like your Aunt Patty."
Bart Simpson,"Oh yeah, there she is."
Marge Simpson,The funeral's in Little Neck Falls. Looks like we'll have to go to Duff Gardens another time.
Lisa Simpson,We understand.
Bart Simpson,No use complaining about something you can't change.
Homer Simpson,But I wanna go to Duff Gardens. Right now!
Marge Simpson,"Oh Homer, quit pouting."

,
Bart Simpson,ON TOP OF SPAGHETTI... ALL COVERED WITH CHEESE... I LOST MY POOR MEATBALL...
Marge Simpson,If you don't mind! We're on our way to a funeral.
Homer Simpson,"Ding-dong, the witch is dead."
Bart Simpson,WHICH OLD WITCH?
Homer Simpson,Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.
Selma Bouvier,He's hugging us. What do we do?
Patty Bouvier,Just close your eyes and think of MacGyver.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, this luggage is crushing me."
Homer Simpson,Hey you don't hear Lisa complaining.
,
,
Selma Bouvier,I can't believe Auntie Gladys is really gone.
Patty Bouvier,Her legend will live forever.
Homer's Thought Bubble,"Yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!"
Homer Simpson,"Legend of the dog-faced woman! Oh, that's good."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's very rude of you."
Homer Simpson,What?
Selma Bouvier,Could we please stop somewhere? My butt's asleep.
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm almost there."
Waitress,"Another placemat, sir?"
Homer Simpson,Please.
Marge Simpson,"While we're waiting for our pie, let's take a minute to remember Great Aunt Gladys."
Marge Simpson,"Wait a minute. That was ""Prince of Tides."""
,
Lisa Simpson,Five... six... seven... eight...
Marge Simpson,What are you kids playing?
Bart Simpson,Counting game.
Marge Simpson,That's nice.
Lisa Simpson,... Nine... ten...
,
Reverend,He was a good man. He was a kind man. He gave to his community and asked little in return. He never...
Reverend,"That's a woman? Dear Lord. Well, I guess most of what I said can be salvaged."
Patty Bouvier,"Take a seat, bozo. And that ""eulogy"" better not show up on the bill."
Patty Bouvier,I'll keep this short. Gladys lived alone. Died alone. I guess you could say she was a role model for Selma and me. She wasn't a rich woman... but she was rich in spirit.
Man,Forgot my hat.
,
Selma Bouvier,"Patty, I want a baby."
Homer Simpson,"Don't hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers."
Bart Simpson,Eh.
Homer Simpson,"It's just not fair, dammit!"

Aunt Gladys's Corpse,Don't worry about it.
Lisa Simpson,

Lionel Hutz,"I'm Lionel Hutz, executor of Ms. Bouvier's estate. She left a video will, so I earn my fee simply by pressing this ""Play"" button. Pretty sweet, eh?"
Aunt Gladys,"I would like to start by reading a passage from Robert Frost. ""Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and..."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,All in favor of skipping the poem?
Homer Simpson,Thank you.
Aunt Gladys,"And that has made all the difference... Now, let's get down to business."
HUTZ' VOICE,"To my executor, Lionel Hutz, I leave fifty thousand dollars."
Marge Simpson,Mr. Hutz!
MR. HUTZ,You'd be surprised how often that works. You really would!
Aunt Gladys,"To Marge, I leave my collection of potato chips that resemble celebrities. They're all here. Otto Von Bismarck. Maurice Chevalier. Right up to Jay Leno."
Aunt Gladys,"These chips were my children, Marjorie. Take special care of them."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, oh."
Aunt Gladys,"To my sister Jackie, I leave my pet iguana, Jubjub."
Jacqueline Bouvier,Why didn't she just leave me the bowel obstruction that killed her?
Aunt Gladys,"To my dear, childless nieces, Patty and Selma, I leave my grandfather clock and these words: Don't die lonely, like me. Raise a family. And do it now. Now. Now! Now! NOW!"
Patty Bouvier,"Hey, a grandfather clock, not bad."

Princess Opal,

Bag Boy,Paper or plastic?
Selma Bouvier,You decide.
Selma Bouvier,"So, wearing a belt, are ya?"
Bag Boy,Yep.

Selma Bouvier,Orange is really your color.
Bag Boy,They make us wear this.
Selma Bouvier,Shall we continue this conversation over dinner?
Bag Boy,Uh... I'm not allowed to date customers... it's store policy.
Cashier,No it isn't.
Cashier,Ow.
Bag Boy,"Shut up, Arnold."
Cashier,"No, go for it, man."

Marge Simpson,Selma! Your date's over already?
Selma Bouvier,Yeah. I was so depressed I ate a jar of expired olives. I guess I'll never have a baby.
Lisa Simpson,"Aunt Selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?"
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot."
Homer Simpson,I knew that.

Selma Bouvier,How do I know I'm getting quality?

Marge Simpson,Oh. Are you sure you wanna have a baby this way?
Patty Bouvier,"Yeah, you've had some pretty bad experiences ordering out of catalogs. Remember that mail order husband?"
,
Selma Bouvier,Ooh! You look just like your picture.
Selma Bouvier,Sorry. My mind's made up. I wanna have a kid and this is the only way I can do it.
Patty Bouvier,Why do you wanna have a baby so bad?
Selma Bouvier,I gotta lot of love to give. And right now my only outlet is my ham radio.

Homer Simpson,Sand... wich...
Carl Carlson,"Geez, we hardly made a dent in that ten-foot hoagie."
Homer Simpson,I'll give it a good home.
Marge Simpson,You've been eating that thing for a week. I think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
Homer Simpson,Two more feet and I can fit it in the fridge.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I found this behind the radiator. I really think you should throw it away."
Homer Simpson,Suggestion noted.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment."
Marge Simpson,Are you going to eat it?

Homer Simpson,"And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the dental plan?"
Gummy Joe,"I wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure."
Homer Simpson,You know what I think of this contract?
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who is that firebrand, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"That's Homer Simpson, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh?... New man?"
Waylon Smithers,"Actually sir, he thwarted your campaign for governor... you ran over his son... he saved the plant from meltdown and his wife painted your portrait--"
C. Montgomery Burns,Doesn't ring a bell.
,
Workers,Homer! Homer! Homer!
Carl Carlson,I move that Homer Simpson be our new union president. All in favor...
Crowd,Aye!
Carl Carlson,All opposed?
Man,Nay.
Carl Carlson,"Congratulations, Homer!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what does this job pay?"
Carl Carlson,Nothin'.
Homer Simpson,
Carl Carlson,... Unless you're crooked.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
Marge Simpson,"President of the union! I'm so proud of you, Homie."
Lisa Simpson,This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
Homer Simpson,And make life-long connections to the world of Organized Crime. Hmmm... organized crime.
Donut Vendor,"Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just for you."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Gratzi.
Woman,"Don Homer, my son, he has trouble with the..."
Homer Simpson,Eh-Eh-Eh.
Homer Simpson,Molto bene.
Homer Simpson,That's-a-nice-a-donut.
Lisa Simpson,Do you think you can get the dental plan back?
Homer Simpson,"Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish."
Homer Simpson,"Done and done! Heh, heh, heh."
,
Dr. Wolfe,"Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless, and periodically release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein's Obsession for teeth."
Lisa Simpson,Mmmm.
Marge Simpson,"Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. So we'll need something a little more... affordable."
Dr. Wolfe,These pre-date stainless steel so you can't get them wet.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, he's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?"
Lenny Leonard,"Okay, but it's the last time."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract."
C. Montgomery Burns,"And, if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows."
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no."
,
Dr. Wolfe,"Lisa, so you won't be scared, I'll show you some of the tools I'll be using."
Dr. Wolfe,This is the scraper. This is the poker. And this happy little fellow is the gouger.
Lisa Simpson,Uh huh.
Dr. Wolfe,"Now, the first thing I'll be doing is chiseling some teeth out of your jaw- bone. Hold still while I gas you."
Mop Top #1,Look fellas! It's Lisa in the sky.
Mop Top #2,"No diamonds, though."
Mop Top #3,Look out for that campy drawing of Queen Victoria!
Mop Tops,"For the love of God, help us!"
Lisa Simpson,The mirror. The mirror!
,
Marge Simpson,"Honey, you look fine."
Homer Simpson,Who is it?
Goon,Goons.
Homer Simpson,Who?
Goon,Hired goons.
Homer Simpson,Hired goons?
,
Bird,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you."
Homer Simpson,"You know, you could have just called me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons."
Homer Simpson,Hired goons?
C. Montgomery Burns,This is the largest TV in the free world.
Bumblebee Man,Aiiee! Un gato malodoro!
C. Montgomery Burns,
C. Montgomery Burns,This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see. ""It was the best of times. It was the blurst of times?"" You stupid monkey!"
Monkey,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ohh, shut up."
C. Montgomery Burns,And this is my basement.
Homer Simpson,"Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, let's get down to business."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking and I want to take the pressure off."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon."
Homer Simpson,Which way to the bathroom?
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh. It's the twenty-third door on the left.
Homer Simpson,Nope. Nope. Nope.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, he wouldn't even hear me out."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Find the bathroom alright?
Homer Simpson,Uh... yeah.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, you've won this round Simpson, but I'll grind you into the earth like a bug!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A bug, I tell you! A bug!"
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna resign. I don't know why they made me Union President in the first place.
Marge Simpson,Because they love you down at the plant.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh..."
Marge Simpson,That doesn't sound like they like you at all.
Homer Simpson,"Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head."

Seymour Skinner,"Batten down those cowlicks... straighten that part... uncross those eyes, Mister."
Quigley,But I can't.

Photographer,I bet you've got a beautiful smile. Why don't you share it with the world?
Photographer,"We can always stick in a ""Photo Not Available"" card."

Homer Simpson,"Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I've had enough."
Workers,Strike! Strike! Strike!
Carl Carlson,All in favor of a strike...
Workers,Aye!

Man,It was him.
Man,"Let's get him, fellows."

Chief Wiggum,Ahhh. This is the life.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, get me some strike breakers like the kind they had in the 30's."
,
Grampa Simpson,"We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways."
Grampa Simpson,"One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere... Like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... now to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. ""Give me five bees for a quarter"" you'd say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Full power, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,

Lisa Simpson,SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT / BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER / THEY HAVE THE PLANT / BUT WE HAVE THE POWER.

DR. JOYCE,I brought my own mike!
Kent Brockman,"Yes, well, Homer, organized labor has been called a lumbering dinosaur."
Homer Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"Yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Kent Brockman,"Uh, Mr. Burns, you mentioned you wanted an opening tirade?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. No one will be spared. No one!"
Kent Brockman,"A chilling vision of things to come. Homer, any thoughts?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh for God's sake.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Goodbye, Springfield. From hell's heart I stab at thee!"

Lisa Simpson,SO WE'LL MARCH DAY AND NIGHT /

C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing. They're not sad at all, they're actually singing! They sing without juicers! They sing without blenders! They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! Tell Simpson I'm ready to deal"
C. Montgomery Burns,All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was."
Homer Simpson,"Woop, woop, woop! Woop, woop, woop!"
,
Homer Simpson,We're going back to work!
,

Marge Simpson,"Oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces."
Lisa Simpson,And that's the tooth!
Dr. Wolfe,Oops. I left the gas on.

Bart Simpson,"Oh no, I can't see! I'm blind! Blind!"
Homer Simpson,Haw haw. April Fool's.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Haw, haw. April Fool's! I've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker!"
Bart Simpson,"You're goin' down, Homer! I'm gonna fool you!"
Homer Simpson,You talk better than you fool.
Bart Simpson,I'll fool you up real nice!
Homer Simpson,You couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.
Marge Simpson,P.U.
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, what noble visionary thought up April Fool's Day?"
Lisa Simpson,"Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual."
Homer Simpson,God bless those pagans.
Lisa Simpson,April first used to be the Pagan New Year.
,
Pagan Simpsons,Blood for Baal! Blood for Baal!
Lisa Simpson,The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
Homer Simpson,Happy New Year!
Ned Flanders,"Hi-ho pagans! New Years was three months ago, but here's a present anyhoo!"
Todd Flanders,It's ram's blood for your Godless ceremony!
Ned Flanders,April Fool's!
Flanders Family,
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Now who's laughing? Now who's laughing?
,
Homer Simpson,And that's the story of April Fool's Day.
Lisa Simpson,Dad! I was telling the story.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right."
,
Captain Horatio McCallister,Thar she blows! The catch of the day!
Waiters/cooks,"Arrrr, harrrr, harrrrrr!"
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Why, ye mutinous dogs. From this day, I be requirin' hair nets!"
Waiters/cooks,Arrrr... arrrrrr.... arrrrrr....
,
Bart Simpson,I've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? He must have a weakness.
Homer Simpson,"Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will."
Bart Simpson,Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it...
Homer Simpson,"Whew! It's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or I'd have looked quite the fool. An April Fool, as it were."
Bart Simpson,
,
Teenage Clerk,Hey kid. That's for customers only.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, did you know there's a guy outside handing out free Stridex pads?"
Teenage Clerk,"Wow, I'm in pizza-face paradise."
Bart Simpson,Moron.
,
Bumblebee Man,"Ay, no es bueno."
Homer Simpson,So thirsty... Eh. What're you gonna do?
Announcer,"The following is a public service announcement. Excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum."
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... beer.
Bart Simpson,April F...
,
Lou,That sounded like an explosion at the old Simpson place.
Chief Wiggum,Forget it. That's two blocks away.
Lou,It looks like there's beer coming out of the chimney.
Chief Wiggum,I'm proceeding on foot. Call in a Code eight.
Lou,We need pretzels! Repeat! Pretzels!

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Mrs. Simpson, I'm afraid your husband is dead."

Dr. Julius Hibbert,April Fool's! He's very much alive... although I'm afraid he may never walk again.

Homer Simpson,"ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT, GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM..."

Specialist,"Homer has many, many horrible problems. These shadows are brain lesions resulting from numerous blows to the head... And his brain waves are disturbingly erratic."
,
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"...You are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--"
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!
Bart Simpson,Just testing.
Lisa Simpson,Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson,"Bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
Bart Simpson,My finger slipped.
Bart Simpson,Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson,So did mine.
Marge Simpson,Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
Lisa Simpson,Arrrgh!
Homer Simpson,Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson,Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson,Arrrgh!
Bart Simpson,Arrrgh!
Dr. Marvin Monroe,"No, no. No! No, wait a minute! Wait! Wait! Folks! Folks, if I could... Not yet! This is not the way to get healthy!"
,
,
Specialist,"Mrs. Simpson, can you think of anything to account for all this?"
Marge Simpson,I have no idea. Unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff.
,
Bart Simpson,"I won't jump anymore, I promise."
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."
Bart Simpson,"I love you, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"I love you too, son. You know, boy, I don't think I've ever felt as close to you as I do right --"
Homer Simpson,I'm going to make it! I'm going to make it! This is the greatest thrill of my life! I'm king of the world! Woo hoo! Woo hoo!! I--
Specialist,Hmm. That still wouldn't explain what I'm seeing here.
Marge Simpson,You look familiar. Have we met before?
,
,
Vet,Clear! Ugh... Clear!
Nurse,Doctor... he's gone.
Vet,This is the part of the job I hate.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,You're a veterinarian?
Specialist,That's right. And for an extra twenty dollars I'll give Homer a tick bath and then spay him.
Bart Simpson,"Here ya go, Doc."
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,Shop around. You can't beat that price.
,
Homer Simpson,You guys must have been pretty worried about me.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, we know you're tough, Dad. Remember that time you got lost in the forest?"
,
Homer Simpson,"This is a trap. It's going to catch us our dinner. Come on, boy."
Homer Simpson,Shhhh! Just watch.
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, ahh. Ha! Got him!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
Bart Simpson,"Right, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
Marge Simpson,It's true. You have good coping skills.
,
Homer Simpson,"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly."
Bart Simpson,And there's one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I don't think we'll ever forget.
Marge Simpson,Why'd you bring that up?
Bart Simpson,It was an amusing episode... of our lives.
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for coming to visit me, Moe."
Moe Szyslak,I brought you a little present.
Homer Simpson,No! No! Beer bring pain!
Barney Gumble,I can't stand to see him like this!
Moe Szyslak,He really needs a girlfriend.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, what if I wind up as some vegetable, watching TV on the couch? My important work will never be completed."
Marge Simpson,"Society's loss, I suppose. But our marriage has been through hard times and we always pull through."
,
Homer Simpson,Marge!
,
Homer Simpson,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
Marge Simpson,Of course.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey! Way to go, Homer. Way to go."
Another Worker,"Hey, what'll I tell the boss?"
Homer Simpson,Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman I love. And I won't be back for ten minutes.
,
Intern,"You can do it, Homer. Stand up."
Homer Simpson,I can't.
Intern,He just won't budge. I've tried everything. Nothing can reach him.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... chocolate.
,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, chocolate."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Can't breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...Mmm, nuts."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
,
Grampa Simpson,Poor Homer. This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
Grampa Simpson,Ahhh! Kill it! Kill it!
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, please. He's in a coma."
Grampa Simpson,"Coma? Why, I go in and out of comas all the... French toast, please."
Lisa Simpson,Is a coma painful?
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, heck, no! You relive long lost-summers, kiss girls from high school -- it's like one of those TV shows where they show a buncha clips from old episodes."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what he's thinking now."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,This man is costing my health plan five thousand dollars a day. I demand that he die with dignity.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now look, I'm the doctor here!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I demand a second opinion."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hi, everybody!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hi, Dr. Nick!"
Homer Simpson,Oof.
Bart Simpson,And sometimes I got into trouble...
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Oh, dear. I see no signs of life. Just to be safe, we better pull the plug."
C. Montgomery Burns,Yoink.
Marge Simpson,"Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"You have no idea, woman, what that man's put me through."
,
Homer Simpson,Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Please, do go on..."
Homer Simpson,I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, please, continue..."
Homer Simpson,I thought maybe you...
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"I have an unorthodox solution: a ""fantastic voyage"", if you will. Three scientists... One a beautiful woman... will be shrunk to microscopic size. They will then rendezvous in Mr. Simpson's lower colon --"
Lisa Simpson,Eww.
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Well, we have had a little trouble finding volunteers..."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I wish I'd gotten to know you better, Dad. But there were times when we really connected."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
Homer Simpson,No. Let me hear you play.
Lisa Simpson,Why?
Homer Simpson,"Does a father have to explain? Let's just share your gift, okay?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE..."
Homer Simpson,"OVER THERE."""
Lisa Simpson,"I wrote this for you, Dad."
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been a perfect kid..."

Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Homer Simpson,What the...
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,I know that I got you mad once in a while...
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you can't go on like this."
Bart Simpson,I know.
Bart Simpson,...but you always looked out for me.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?"
Homer Simpson,They're fine.
Bart Simpson,"And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me."
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
,
Homer Simpson,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
Homer Simpson,Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's all my fault! I shook up that can of beer!"
Bart Simpson,It was just an April Fool's joke.
Homer Simpson,"Why, you little --"
Marge Simpson,Homie! You're all right!
Lisa Simpson,We're a family again!
,
Homer Simpson,This calls for a celebration. We're all going to Hawaii!
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes!
Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's May 16th."
Lisa Simpson,You were in that coma for seven weeks.
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,You lost five percent of your brain.
Homer Simpson,Me lose brain? Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson,Why'd I laugh?
,
Krusty the Clown,Mmm. Delicious.
Chef,"Now, Krusty, I hear it's your birthday, so I got your mother's recipe for matzoh brei."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, I don't do the Jewish stuff on the air."
Chef,"But Herschel, bubbeleh --"
Krusty the Clown,Ix-nay on the Ew-Jay! Roll the cartoon.
,
Lisa Simpson,It's so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it happened again!"
Bart Simpson,What are you gonna change your name to when you grow up?
Lisa Simpson,Lois Sanborn.
Bart Simpson,Steve Bennett.
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Lisa Simpson,This is a rather lifeless outing.
Bart Simpson,Don't worry. They're building to something.
Scratchy,Ow.
Itchy,"He, he, he."
Scratchy,"Kids, say no to drugs."
,
Krusty the Clown,"I could pull a better cartoon out of my A... Hey, whoa! Wasn't that great, kids?"
,
Lisa Simpson,That's as bad as the tasteless Itchy and Sambo cartoons of the late 30s. The writers should be ashamed of themselves.
Bart Simpson,Cartoons have writers?
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, sort of."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah, well you and I could write a better cartoon than that."
Lisa Simpson,"Write a cartoon ourselves? Bart, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Bart Simpson,Probably not.
Bart Simpson,Lie in the snow and count to sixty.
Bart Simpson,"Giddiyup! Merry Christmas, suckers."
Marge Simpson,"""Third Notice,"" ""Final Notice,"" ""Some Guys are Coming.""... Ooh, what's this?"
Marge Simpson,An invitation to our High School Reunion.
Marge Simpson,"Gee, that's odd. They didn't send one to you."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom."
Marge Simpson,Oh my God.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I never graduated from high school."
Marge Simpson,"Well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. Wait, maybe it does."
Homer Simpson,"I never passed remedial science one ""A""."
Marge Simpson,And you're a nuclear technician?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay."
Marge Simpson,What did you way?
Homer Simpson,"I don't know. I flunked Latin, too."
Lisa Simpson,"According to this book, the first thing we need is a setting."
Bart Simpson,Okay... setting... setting... setting... setting...
Bart Simpson,How about a barber shop?
Lisa Simpson,Great.
,
Lisa Simpson,Scratchy is getting a haircut. Then Itchy -- the barber -- chops Scratchy's head off with a razor!
Bart Simpson,"Eh, too predictable. The way I see it, instead of shampoo Itchy covers Scratchy's hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself."
Elvis,"Eh, this show ain't no good."
Lisa Simpson,Finished. Now all we have to do is put our names on it.
Bart Simpson,Fine. Put my name first.
Lisa Simpson,No way.
Bart Simpson,"All right, then to decide it, I propose a race around the world. Meet me at Luster Square at noon tomorrow. The queen herself shall drop the checkered flag."
Lisa Simpson,"Look there's only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors."
Bart Simpson,Rock.
Lisa Simpson,Paper.
Bart Simpson,

Bart's Thoughts,Good ol' rock. Nothing beats that.
Lisa's Thoughts,Poor predictable Bart. Always takes rock.
Writer,Fair Harvard I
Writer,"You, sir, have the boorish manners of a Yalie."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, they rejected our script."
Bart Simpson,I guess we're just not cut out to be writers.
Lisa Simpson,Maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids. Let's put a grownup's name on it.
Bart Simpson,"Well, how about Grampa? He's pretty out of it. He let those guys use his check book for a whole year."
,
,
Grampa Simpson,"... when I read your magazine I don't see one wrinkled face or a single toothless grin. For shame! To the sickos at ""Modern Bride"" magazine."
Bart Simpson,"Hey Grampa, we need to know your first name."
Grampa Simpson,You're making my tombstone!
Lisa Simpson,"No, we're just curious."
Grampa Simpson,"All right, let's see. First name... first name... well, whenever I'm confused, I just check my underwear. It holds the answer to all the important questions."
Grampa Simpson,Call me... Abraham Simpson!
Lisa Simpson,"Grampa, how'd you take off your underwear without taking off your pants?"
Grampa Simpson,I don't know.
,
Writer,"Sir, you locked my office, and I wanted to get my Harvard mug."
,
Orderly,"Phone call, Simpson."
Grampa Simpson,Beh?
Roxie,"Is this the Abraham Simpson who wrote the ""Itchy and Scratchy"" episode?"
Roxie,"I'm sorry, but we have a substantial check here for a Mr. Abraham Simpson."
Grampa Simpson,"That's right, I did the Iggy."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, my high school yearbook..."
Homer Simpson,You handsome devil.
Homer Simpson,I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
Homer Simpson,"""Activities, none. Sports, none. Honors, none."" So many memories."
Marge Simpson,Time to go to the reunion.
Homer Simpson,"It'll be great to see the old gang again... Potsy, Ralph Malph, ""The Fonz""..."
Marge Simpson,"That was ""Happy Days."""
Homer Simpson,"No, they weren't all happy Days. Like the time Pinky Tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks, and my Dad, Tom Bosley, had to get it back."
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Principal Dondelinger."
Principal Dondelinger,"Marge Bouvier, it's so good to see you."
Principal Dondelinger,"Sorry, sir. We're not letting vagrants sleep in the gym tonight. But we will be putting some scraps by the back door."
Homer Simpson,
Principal Dondelinger,"Oh, it's you Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Look, there's Bobby Mindich, the class clown."
Bobby Mindich,I am not a crook.
Homer Simpson,Richard Nixon.
Marge Simpson,I know.
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh my God, it's my old boyfriend, Artie Ziff."
ARTIE,"Hello, Marge. Have you heard? I'm stinking rich."
ARTIE,Jealous?
Homer Simpson,I'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
ARTIE,I would.
Homer Simpson,Hmmm.
Marge Simpson,Homer!
,
Bobby Mindich,"Hey, man. It's Dave. Open up man. Dave's not here, man."
Homer Simpson,
Bobby Mindich,"Okay now, let's move on..."
Bart Simpson,Grampa? Grampa?
Homer Simpson,"The guy's so high, he doesn't even know that's Dave."
Bobby Mindich,Homer? Homer?
Homer Simpson,"Homer's not here, man."
Bobby Mindich,"Okay, very good. Now, let's get on with our rilly big shew..."
Homer Simpson,Ed Sullivan.
Marge Simpson,Shhhh.
Bobby Mindich,"... First, the award for the alumnus who's gained the most weight..."
Bobby Mindich,Homer Simpson!
Homer Simpson,Oh my God!
Bobby Mindich,"How'd you do it, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,I discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.

Bart Simpson,Since when could you write a song?
Homer Simpson,"There are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. Now off to bed."

Homer Simpson,It's probably the person you least suspect!
Lisa Simpson,"That's good, Dad."

Sideshow Bob,"Hello, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Mom! Dad!
Sideshow Bob,Your family can't help you now.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no! Dad's been drugged!"
Marge Simpson,"No, he hasn't."
,
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
Sideshow Bob,"Well, Bart. Any last requests?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, there is one, but..."
Bart Simpson,Nah.
Sideshow Bob,"No, go on."
Bart Simpson,"Well, you have such a beautiful voice..."
Sideshow Bob,Guilty as charged.
Bart Simpson,"Uh-huh. Anyway... I was wondering if you could sing the entire score of ""The HMS Pinafore""?"
Sideshow Bob,"Very well, Bart. I shall send you to heaven before I send you to hell. And a two and a three and..."
Sideshow Bob,WE SAIL THE OCEAN BLUE / AND OUR SAUCY SHIP'S A BEAUTY / WE ARE SOBER MEN AND TRUE / AND ATTENTIVE TO OUR DUTY...
Sideshow Bob,I'M CALLED LITTLE BUTTERCUP / POOR LITTLE BUTTERCUP / THOUGH I COULD NEVER TELL WHY...
Sideshow Bob,WHAT NEVER? / NO NEVER / WHAT NEVER?...
Bart Simpson,HARDLY EVER! HE'S HARDLY EVER SICK AT SEA!
Sideshow Bob,FOR HE HIMSELF HAS SAID IT / AND IT'S CLEARLY TO HIS CREDIT / THAT HE IS AN ENGLISHMAN / HE REMAINS AN E-E-E-E-NGLISHMAN!
Sideshow Bob,"And now, the final curtain."
Chief Wiggum,"Hold it right there, Sideshow Bob. You're under arrest."
Sideshow Bob,By Lucifer's Beard!
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, yeah. It's a good thing you drifted by this brothel."
,
Bart Simpson,"I knew I had to buy some time. So, I asked him to sing the score from ""The HMS Pinafore."""
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies."
Bart Simpson,"Take him away, boys."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, no fair."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, I'm the Chief here. Bake him away, toys."
Lou,"What'd you say, Chief?"
Chief Wiggum,Do what the kid says.
,
Marge Simpson,It's so good to be home again.
Grampa Simpson,Look what happened without my pills.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, run upstairs and get Grampa's medicine!"
Jasper Beardly,Not so fast. I wanna court this fair young maiden.
Grampa Simpson,There's something you should know about me.
Jasper Beardly,I've got Steve and Edie tickets.
Grampa Simpson,I'm all yours.

Woman's Voice,Core meltdown in ten seconds... nine... eight.
Woman's Voice,Meltdown averted. Good boy.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Huh? What? How dare you disturb me during nap time!
Nrc Woman,We're from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This is a surprise test of worker competence.
C. Montgomery Burns,"There must be some mistake. We, uh, we make cookies here. Mr. Burns' old fashioned, good time, extra chewy..."
Nrc Man,Get the axe.
C. Montgomery Burns,The watchdog of public safety. Is there any lower form of life?
Waylon Smithers,"Don't worry, sir. I rounded up our less gifted employees and led them into the basement."
,
Dumb Employee #1,"Duh, Homer, why are we down here?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee."
Dumb Employee #2,But why?
Homer Simpson,You guys are pathetic. No wonder Smithers made me Head Bee Guy.
Dumb Employee #1,"Duh, it's gettin' away..."
Dumb Employee #2,Oh! We did bad!
Homer Simpson,
,
Nrc Man,Is there a Homer Simpson present?
Waylon Smithers,I'm afraid he couldn't bee here.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, he's in Geneva, chairing a conference on Nuclear Fission. Yes, that should stick."
Homer Simpson,The bee bit my bottom. Now my bottom's big! Oh!
,
Nrc Man,"Homer, this is an exact replica of your workstation. Now, we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight."
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you talking about?
Homer Simpson,What do I do!? What do I do!? In the name of God you've got to tell me!
Nrc Man,"Relax, it's just a simulator. Nothing can go wrong."
Homer Simpson,Just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.
Nrc Man,"No, this can't be happening!"
Waylon Smithers,"For the love of god, sir, there are two seats..."
C. Montgomery Burns,I like to put my feet up.
Homer Simpson,"Must destroy mankind! Ohh, lunch time."
,
Nrc Man,We're still not sure how he caused the meltdown. There wasn't any nuclear material in the truck.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe. Now you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely Smithers is standing..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Or you can trade it all in for what's in this box.
Nrc Man,The box! The box!
Nrc Woman,"Look, Burns, this is a big problem. You can't just throw money at it and make it go away."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Gentlemen, I've decided there will be no investigation. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go away."
Nrc Man,"You're in big trouble, Burns. Homer Simpson's job requires college training in Nuclear Physics. Now you get your man up to speed or we'll be forced to take legal action."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Is that so? Well I have the feeling you'll be ""dropping"" the charges..."
Waylon Smithers,"The painters moved your desk, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes."
,
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, Simpson. My lawyers and I were in the neighborhood and thought we'd stop by."
Scholar,"Uh... excuse me, what are you doing?"
Marge Simpson,Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares?
Lawyer,Yes. He would.
Homer Simpson,So you want me to go to college?
Bart Simpson,College? Barber or clown?
Homer Simpson,Bart!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and one more thing. You must find the jade monkey before the next full moon."
Waylon Smithers,"Actually, sir, we found the jade monkey. It was in your glove compartment."
C. Montgomery Burns,And the road maps and ice scraper?
Waylon Smithers,"They were in there too, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent. It's all falling into place.
Marge Simpson,I think this is a great opportunity. You could learn so much.
Homer Simpson,"Maybe you're right. I did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way."
,
Counselor,"Homer, sign this application and you're a shoe-in."
Homer Simpson,That dog has somebody's ham! This I gotta see!
Homer Simpson,"C'mon! Gimme the hand, you stupid dog! C'mon! Gimme' that!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, don't let these application essays throw you. Let's see... ""List your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."""
Homer Simpson,"Is ""TV Guide"" a book?"
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Son of Sniglets??
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"Katharine Hepburn's ""Me""?"
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,I suck.
Homer Simpson,... it was the most I ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.
Bart Simpson,"You the man, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch..."
Bart Simpson,"I dunno, Dad. Don't you have a better picture?"
Homer Simpson,"Relax, a photo can't make any difference."
,
Admissions Man,He looks crazy.
,
Admissions Woman,Agreed. Reading his essay would only waste valuable seconds.
,
Announcer,"Finally, the great taste of Worchestershire sauce... in a soft drink!"
Hillbilly Man,Ah... steakey.
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that I really should watch."
Announcer,"We now return to ""School of Hard Knockers"" starring Corey Masterson."
President,"Dean Bitterman, I hope nothing unsavory happens during my visit. As you know, I am the President of the United States."
Angry Dean,"Oh, don't worry, I've expelled those rowdy members of Chug-a-lug House."
Homer Simpson,I hate that lousy dean!
Corey,"Your bra-bomb better work, Nerdlinger."
Nerdlinger,
Nerdlinger,"Corey! Don't worry, Mr. President, I... Mr. President!?"
President,"Lighten up, Bitterman. That youngster will make a perfect addition to my cabinet... Secretary of Partying Down!"
Angry Dean,G-rrrrr!
Homer Simpson,"Yes! Take that, Bitterman!"
Marge Simpson,"Homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! A flyer for a hardware store!
Bart Simpson,"Well, Pop, what are you gonna do?"
Homer Simpson,Something I should have done a long time ago...
Marge Simpson,"You don't know, do you?"
Homer Simpson,"No, ma'am."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Don't worry, Simpson, it just so happens I have a chair at Springfield University..."
,
Scholar,"I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but I must object. This ""Simpson"" is not qualified."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. Well, you know, fellas, I look at the admissions board a lot like a baseball team. You all like baseball, don't you?"
Overseers,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, to have a successful baseball club, you need teamwork. Not some hot dog admissions officer playing by his own rules."
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm giving you the beating of your life!
Scholar,"Look, if - stop that. If you wanted him in that badly, why didn't you just say so?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, dismember the corpse and send his widow a corsage."
,
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo, I'm a college man! I won't need my high school diploma anymore."
Homer Simpson,I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART/ I AM SO SMART. S-M-R-T...I MEAN S-M-A-R-T.
,
Homer Simpson,My first day of college. I wish my father was alive to see this.
Grampa Simpson,Hey!
Homer Simpson,How long have you been back there?
Grampa Simpson,Three days.
Homer Simpson,Nerd!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that isn't very nice."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
Homer Simpson,"Hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?"
Jock,Pardon me?
,
Homer Simpson,I'll be a campus hero...
Skinny Student,Attention everyone! The punch has been spiked!
Crowd,
Skinny Student,"Don't worry, your parents have been called and will be here to pick you up shortly."
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. And unless movies and TV have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!"
Dean Bobby Peterson,"Hi there, hello, I'm Dean Peterson, but you can call me Bobby. I just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from studying or whatever, I'm always up for some Hackey Sack. Or hey, if you just want to come by and jam, I used to be the bass player for ""The Pretenders."""
Homer Simpson,"Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
Professor,"Good morning and welcome to Nuclear Physics 101. I see a lot of new faces, but you know the old saying, ""Out with the old, in with the nucleus!"""
Homer Simpson,Hold me.
Professor,"Now, we'll begin by - oops..."
Homer Simpson,"You see that, sir. Drops his notes."
Professor,"Now, if anyone would like to stay, I'm going to hold a comprehensive review session after every class."
Homer Simpson,Do we have to?
Professor,No.
Homer Simpson,Then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. Besides, it isn't costing us - I swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site."
,
Foreman,"Sir, six cinderblocks are missing."
Architect,There'll be no hospital then. I'll tell the children.
,
Professor,"This proton accelerator de-stabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it..."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, excuse me ""Professor Brainiac,"" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works."
Professor,"Well please, come down and show us."
Homer Simpson,"All right, I will."
Homer Simpson,"In there, guys."
Men,"Thanks, Homer."
Dean,"Homer, no one blames you for the accident. We simply feel you might benefit with a little outside tutoring. I researched these names myself..."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you've won this round, Dean. But the war isn't over."
Dean,Hello?
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head."
Dean,"Homer, is that you?"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hiya, gang!"
Doug,Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!
Gary,Stop the Humanoid!
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm supposed to get a physics tutor..."
Doug,"Well, you've come to the right place then. If there's one thing we know, it is science..."
Gary,And math...
C. Montgomery Burns,Do as I say!
Benjamin,And the words to every Monty Python routine...
Benjamin,We are the Knights who say Nee! Nee! Nee! Nee!
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh. ""Nee."""
,
Homer Simpson,We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf.
Bart Simpson,"Listen to yourself, man. You're hangin' with nerds."
Homer Simpson,You take that back...
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. These boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds."
Homer Simpson,Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, not Souter... Oh, no."
,
Doug,"Come on, Mr. Simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't know the periodic table."
Homer Simpson,I'll write it on my hand...
Doug,Ho. Including all known Lanthanides and Actinides? Good luck!
Homer Simpson,"C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
Homer Simpson,We're gonna go out and par-ty!
Gary,"Wait a minute, I'll put on my snow pants."
Doug,Me too.
Benjamin,Me too.
,
Homer Simpson,"Aah, the college road trip. What better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem?"
Marge Simpson,If you're going for a ride I'd like you to take Bart and Lisa.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good..."
Doug,Mr. Simpson? Gary spilled his ear medicine.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, those baby ducks were so cute. I can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them."
Gary,I need to go to the bathroom.
Lisa Simpson,We stopped five minutes ago.
Gary,"Yeah, but someone knocked on the door and I couldn't go."
,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, a big crazy prank is just what the doctor ordered. The Dean'll go nuts!"
Homer Simpson,"I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge."
Bart Simpson,"So it's a prank you're lookin' for, is it? I'll give you your prank..."
Bart Simpson,"The only other college in fifty miles is Springfield A&M, so they're our best target."
Homer Simpson,Those bastards...
Bart Simpson,"Meet Sir Oinks-A-lot, the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M. Here he is presiding over last year's homecoming. Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon. And here he is rolling in his own filth. Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinks-A-lot..."
Homer Simpson,And then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
Homer Simpson,What?
,
Homer Simpson,"Look! You pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight..."
Pig,
Doug,"Mr. Simpson, I don't think he likes that."
Homer Simpson,"Of course he does. He's a cute little piggy. Curly, straight, curly, straight, curly..."
Homer Simpson,Ow! Why you little...
,
Doug,"Hey, the pig's acting kinda funny."
Gary,He and Mr. Simpson split a case of malt liquor.
Benjamin,"Guys, he's really sick."
Dean Bobby Peterson,"Hello, that sounds like a pig fainting."
Pig,
Dean Bobby Peterson,"I'm sorry, boys, I've never expelled anyone before, but that pig had some powerful friends."
Richard Nixon,"Oh, you'll pay. Don't think you won't pay."
,
Homer Simpson,"Guys, believe me, I didn't mean to get you expelled..."
Benjamin,"Oh, don't worry Mr. Simpson. We can take care of ourselves."
Snake Jailbird,"Uh, wallet inspector."
Doug,Here you go. I believe that's all in order.
Snake Jailbird,"Huh, I can't believe that worked."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's not the wallet inspector."
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, they don't have anywhere to stay, and they're geniuses. They'll solve all our problems. They'll elevate us to the status of kings on Earth."
Benjamin,"Mr. Simpson, we all have nose bleeds."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, for the love of..."
Marge Simpson,What's wrong with this phone? It's making crazy noises.
Gary,"Those ""crazy noises"" are computer signals."
Benjamin,"Yeah, some guys at M.I.T. are sending us reasons why Captain Picard is better than Captain Kirk."
Doug,They're out of their minds!
Marge Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,I heard about this. This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy.
Bart Simpson,Wow!
Bart Simpson,My purpose in life is to witness this moment.
Lisa Simpson,
Gary,We need the outlet for our rock tumbler.
Lisa Simpson,Plug it in! Plug it in!
Gary,What? The rock tumbler or the TV?
Lisa Simpson,The TV! The TV!
Krusty the Clown,Wow! They'll never let us show that again. Not in a million years!
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, start diggin' some nerd holes."
Lisa Simpson,It's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- Can't we do something?
Homer Simpson,"Look, I'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. Right, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,No. I want those geeks out of my house.
Doug,You really think you can get us back into college?
Homer Simpson,Absolutely. Now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
Doug,Why does it have to be zany?
Homer Simpson,I got it! We're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
,
Homer Simpson,Perfect.
,
Gary,Okay. We push him out of the way in exactly three seconds.
Doug,Should we correct for wind resistance?
Benjamin,Hmm. Possibly... What do you think?
Doug,Oh my.
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, dean, I'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank."
Dean Bobby Peterson,Prank?
Homer Simpson,And all those other pranks were my idea too. I'm the one who should be expelled.
Dean Bobby Peterson,"Well, I'm touched by your honesty. And who knows, perhaps I've been a bit of an ogre myself."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, you have."
Dean Bobby Peterson,"How's this, I'll re-admit your friends and we'll forget this whole silly incident ever occurred."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Oh, Dean, this is what your new hip is going to look like."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,You're gonna have to go easy on it.
,
Benjamin,"Oh, it's good to be back after all these weeks."
Doug,"Better check our answering machine, huh?"
Automated Voice,Number of messages received zero.
Gary,"We really want to thank you, Mr. Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"No problem, guys. The important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
Professor,"So, in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam."
Homer Simpson,"Exam?!? Oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams."
Homer Simpson,
Gary,What are you gonna do Mr. Simpson?
Homer Simpson,"Actually, I've been working on a plan. During the exam, I'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out."
Gary,"Or, with our help you could cram like you've never crammed before."
Homer Simpson,Whatever. Either way is good...
Gary,"Aw, man, I can't believe you failed."
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.
Gary,"Mr. Simpson, there is a way. We could... well, use a computer to change your grade."
Homer Simpson,Computers can do that?
Gary,Oh yes. The only problem is the moral dilemma it raises... which requires...
Homer Simpson,Mora wuza?
,
Marge Simpson,"An ""A plus""! How did you do it?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, let's just say I had help from a ""little magic box..."""
Marge Simpson,You changed your grade with a computer?
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Way to go, dad!"
Homer Simpson,"Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
Gary,No we didn't.
Homer Simpson,Oh. Then I learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
Lisa Simpson,"No you didn't. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong."
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, true."
Marge Simpson,"And I learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. You're worse than that crusty old dean."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess it's back to college for me. And that means it's time to... What did I teach you guys?"
Gary,Par-ty down?
Homer Simpson,Yes.
,
Guards,O-wee-o. We-Oooo. O-wee-o. We-Oooo.
Waylon Smithers,Shhh.
Guards,O-wee-o. We-Oooo. O-wee-o. We-Oooo.
,
7-YEAR OLD BURNS,Tra-la-la-la-la-la! Tra-la-la-la-la. I am the happiest boy there is! Aren't I Bobo?
Burns' Mother,"Happy! Come here, Happy!"
7-YEAR OLD BURNS,"Yes, Momsie?"
Burns's Father,"Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural parents? Or would you rather live with this twisted loveless billionaire?"
7-YEAR OLD BURNS,Let's roll.
Burns's Father,Wait! You forgot your bear! A symbol of your lost youth and innocence!
Burns's Father,Oh well. At least we still have his little brother George.
Charlie,Hm... I wonder what makes it turn?
George Burns,"Ba-ba-ba-ba. Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home. Ba-ba-ba-ba trust me, it'll be funny when I'm an old man."
C. Montgomery Burns,I want my teddy!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bobo! Bo-Bo! Oh, it's you. The bedpan's under my pillow."
Waylon Smithers,"Who's Bobo, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Bobo? I meant Lobo. Sheriff Lobo. They never should have canceled that show.
Waylon Smithers,"I see. On another topic, the preparations for your birthday have begun."
C. Montgomery Burns,I won't get what I really want
Waylon Smithers,No one does.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers."
,
Homer Simpson,Lobo! Lobo! Bring back Sheriff Lobo! Lobo! Lobo!
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,What? Homie!
Homer Simpson,Oh no! Burns' Birthday!
Marge Simpson,What's wrong?
Homer Simpson,Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.
C. Montgomery Burns,Where is that dreaded piÃ±ata?
Homer Simpson,Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow!
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Not funny. And the one in my pants really hurt.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers. Who is he?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, sir. One of the carbon blobs from Sector 7G. But I don't think..."
C. Montgomery Burns,I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.
Waylon Smithers,"Fine, sir. I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esq material."
,
Homer Simpson,Hee hee! I'm so funny! This is gonna be great.
Marge Simpson,What are you doin'?
Homer Simpson,I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?
Bart Simpson,
Carl Carlson,Who cares?
Marge Simpson,I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
Lisa Simpson,"Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. I paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants."
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...
Bart Simpson,Incontinent... Too rich.
Lisa Simpson,Does either of you know what incontinent means?
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't spoil our fun!"
Marge Simpson,Come on dear. It's time to go.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, stupid!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer! You've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. Hey Flanders, you smell like Manure!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh-oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose-news, neighbor."
,
Goon,"Hey, no one-termers."
Jimmy Carter,"You too, huh? Hey, I know a good yogurt place."
George H.W. Bush,"Get away from me, loser."
Waylon Smithers,Ladies and gentlemen: I give you Montgomery Burns: the life.
C. Montgomery Burns,Bobo!
Waylon Smithers,"Here are several fine young men, who I'm sure are gonna go far. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Ramones."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahh, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves."
RAMONE #1,I'd just like to say this gig sucks.
RAMONE #2,"Hey, up Yours, Springfield."
RAMONE #3,One-two-three-four!
RAMONE #4,"Go to hell, you old bastard."
Drummer,"Hey, I think they liked us."
C. Montgomery Burns,Have the Rolling Stones killed.
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, those aren't..."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,This stinks... piffle... dust buster? Eych.
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, I've arranged for the people of Australia to join hands tonight and spell out your name with candles. There's a satellite hookup on that monitor if you'll just turn your head slightly."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Eh, no time. Next!"
,
Waylon Smithers,"I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie was just run over in the parking lot."
Waylon Smithers,And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!
Homer Simpson,Are you ready to laugh?
Man,Oh... That poor dog.
Homer Simpson,I said are you ready to laugh?!
Woman,"Quiet, you awful man!"
Homer Simpson,"You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap..."
C. Montgomery Burns,What!
Homer Simpson,I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...
C. Montgomery Burns,How dare you!
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky."
Homer Simpson,"I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah."
Homer Simpson,"I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah."
C. Montgomery Burns,Destroy him.
Homer Simpson,"Blah, bla..."
Homer Simpson,Unghhhh!
C. Montgomery Burns,This party is over.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again."
Lisa Simpson,I'd like to believe that this time. I really would.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father."
Bart Simpson,"Yes'm. Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, boy. He'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday."
Lisa Simpson,I knew it.
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay."
Waylon Smithers,"Look at all the wonderful things you have, Mr. Burns. King Arthur's Excalibur. The only existing nude photo of Mark Twain, and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word ""suckers"" in it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, yes. So what?"
Waylon Smithers,"You want your bear, Bobo, don't you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! Resistance is futile. Oh God, how I only want my bear. But he's gone. Gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him."
Mechanic,"Put some grease in your garter, Lindy! You're late."
Hitler,This is all your fault!
Explorer,You've got to start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Oooh! A head bag! Those are chock full of... heady goodness.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, it's a Teddy bear!"
Bart Simpson,"Ew! Gross! It's probably diseased or something. Here, Maggie."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Here's something that should cheer you up, sir."
Waylon Smithers,It's me sir. Bobo. Hug me. Squeeze me. Tug at my fur.
C. Montgomery Burns,Enough. Stop this grotesque charade. Now find my Teddy.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and uh... leave the costume."
,
,
Kent Brockman,"The Burns Bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house. You could be looking at it right now."
Kent Brockman,"It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one."
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down."
Homer Simpson,Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!
,
Homer Simpson,Right. That makes sense.
Homer Simpson,No! Lemme go!
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Well, it's not your original bear, of course. But it Is programmed to be just as cuddly. Oh dog gone it..."
Professor Jonathan Frink,It's supposed to be doing a little dance.
C. Montgomery Burns,Get this bear off...
Professor Jonathan Frink,I'm trying to turn it off.
Bear,"No, bear want to live."

Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,How long have we had these fish? Wait! The bear! Burns' bear!
Lisa Simpson,Bobo. It's Mr. Burns' bear all right.
Homer Simpson,"Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio."
Homer Simpson,"Two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun..."
Voice,"Homer, you're drooling on the mic again."
Lisa Simpson,I think we should just give him the bear that he cherishes so much.
Marge Simpson,"Hmm, better sew that eye back on."
Bart Simpson,No. Let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
Homer Simpson,Yes. We'll send the eye.
Marge Simpson,I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. And then we'll make him double it.
Marge Simpson,Well why can't I be greedy once in awhile?
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Bobo! My beautiful Bobo! I promise I'll never leave you behind again.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, yes. Naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because... I'm strapped for cash."
C. Montgomery Burns,"As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But I'm sure we can come to an understanding."
Homer Simpson,Yes sir. Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
C. Montgomery Burns,May I offer you a drink?
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Burns. No deal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Don't worry, Smithers, he's playing hard ball now. But it won't take him long to crack."
,
Homer Simpson,I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink!
Hooded Man,Nope.
Homer Simpson,I knew you'd come crawling back.
C. Montgomery Burns,How much do you want?
Homer Simpson,"A million dollars and three Hawaiian Islands. Good ones, not the leper ones."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Done. Now, give me that bear."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya. Here you go.
Homer Simpson,It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie!
Maggie Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Give me the bear!
Waylon Smithers,The bear! The bear!
Waylon Smithers,
Maggie Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, Maggie."
Homer Simpson,"The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You've made a mistake, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, big deal. Who needs his money? We're gettin' by okay."
Grampa Simpson,"Son! You've gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don't have any insurance. So, hows 'bout you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent shot, Smithers. I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time."
Ned Flanders,Howdy gents. What can I diddily do you for?
Ned Flanders,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Remember, Smithers. In and out in eighteen seconds."
Marge Simpson,"More cocoa, Mr. Burns?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes.
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. Sixty-four slices of American cheese.
Homer Simpson,Sixty four... sixty three...
Marge Simpson,Have you been up all night eating cheese?
Homer Simpson,I think I'm blind.
C. Montgomery Burns,Good day to you.

Workman,Excuse me wanted to see the guy who valued the happiness of his children over money.
Homer Simpson,Right here.
Workman #2,"Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball."
Homer Simpson,My life can't get any worse.
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties."
Homer Simpson,After lunch can I whip you?
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, I know you like the bear... but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... this box!"
Homer Simpson,See Maggie? See the fun box! Do do do do doo do...
Homer Simpson,Do do do do doo...
Homer Simpson,No! My box! My box!
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,I think we need a new hairdryer.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money."
Marge Simpson,"I don't hate you, I'm proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most."
Homer Simpson,"Aw thanks, Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul."
Homer Simpson,Box...
Marge Simpson,Gimme that.
Homer Simpson,
Dinosaur,TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR.... / TWO PLUS TWO IS FOUR....

C. Montgomery Burns,"Give me my bear, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,
Host,It's the Soulll Mass Transit System.
C. Montgomery Burns,Give it to me.
Bumblebee Man,Es yo-yo is grande.
Bumblebee Man,Aye Chihuahua.
C. Montgomery Burns,"As you can see, Simpson, I've taken over all seventy-eight channels. And you won't see any of your favorite shows again until you give in."
Otto Mann,"Whoa, that bites."
Patty Bouvier,Holy crap.
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,What's that you say? You can live without television as long as you have beer?
Homer Simpson,That's right.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer swilling tube jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson."
Barney Gumble,"Homer, give him what he wants."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Barney, leave me alone."
Barney Gumble,Oops!
Barney Gumble,Uh-oh.
,
,
Nelson Muntz,My old man can't get a beer because his old man won't give a bear to another old man. Let's get him.
Jimbo Jones,"Wait, why are we gettin' him?"
Martin Prince,"Look, fellas. The first snapdragon of the season."
Nelson Muntz,Never mind. Let's just get him.
Jimbo Jones,Yeah!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm home!"
Waylon Smithers,"What, already?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes.
Lisa Simpson,Is it my imagination or is TV getting worse?
Homer Simpson,"Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out, Smithers!"
Homer Simpson,I love this show
Homer Simpson,"Well well, look whose come to apologize."
Moe Szyslak,C'mon. Let's go in there and get the bear!
Moe Szyslak,I got it!
Mob,
Moe Szyslak,"Aw jeez, will you look at that?"
Jasper Beardly,What have we become?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,We've given the word mob a bad name!
Mob,"She's gonna break a lot of hearts, Homer. I love what you've done with the house, Marge, etc..."
Moe Szyslak,What should we do now?
Seymour Skinner,"Hey, everybody. Let's go sing at the hospital! FOR WE'VE GOT..."
Mob,HI-GH HOPES / WE'VE GOT HI-GH HOPES.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, look what you've reduced me to."
Waylon Smithers,Please... please.
Homer Simpson,"But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's."
C. Montgomery Burns,
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, good sand today, hm."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I don't usually... well, just this once."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ugh.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damn you, paparazzo!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement."
C. Montgomery Burns,Beaten by an infant. What could be more humiliating?
Carl Carlson,"Well, there were a few left but we chucked them at an old man for kicks."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang on to that bear. Don't make the same mistake I made."
C. Montgomery Burns,"For me? Bobo? Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened. I'm actually happy. Take a note. From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone."
Waylon Smithers,"Sorry, sir, I don't have a pencil."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Eh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it."
Homer Simpson,"Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?"
Marge Simpson,"It's an ending, that's enough."
,
Waylon Smithers,There you go.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Bobo reunited at last. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you. Ah, yes. Wonder..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bobo I know I say this every century, but I'll never leave you behind again."
Waylon Smithers,"Wait for me, sir."
,
Bart Simpson,"Paintings. Lifeless images rendered in colorful goop. But at night, they take on a life of their own."
Bart Simpson,They become portals to hell so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
Marge Simpson,"Bart! You should warn people this episode is very frightening and maybe they'd rather listen to that old War of the Worlds broadcast on NPR, Hmmm?"
Bart Simpson,"Yes, mother."
Marge Simpson,"Good, now you hold Maggie. I'm going to buy some earrings at the gift shop."
Bart Simpson,"The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil, vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth. Of course, I refer to..."
Bart Simpson,Buh Dmfl! The Devil!

Homer Simpson,
Lenny Leonard,"Sorry Homer. While you were daydreaming, we ate all the donuts."
,
Grampa Simpson,Damn buzzards! I ain't dead yet.
,
Homer Simpson,All right. Stay calm. Remember your training.
Homer Simpson,"Dear Homer, I.O.U. one emergency donut. Signed, Homer. Bastard. He's always one step ahead. Oh, I'd sell my soul for a donut!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, that can be arranged."
Homer Simpson,Flanders! You're the devil?
Devil,It's always the one you least suspect! Now many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting upon the grave ramifica...
Homer Simpson,Do you have a donut or not?
Devil,"Comin' up, just sign here. Careful, hot pen."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmm... Who's that goat-legged fellow? I like the cut of his jib.
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, the Prince of Darkness, sir. He's your eleven o'clock."
Devil,"Now remember: the instant you finish it, I own your soul for --"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?"
Devil,"Technically no, but --"
Homer Simpson,I'm smarter than the de-vil! I'm smarter than the dev-
Devil,"You are not smarter than me! I'll see you in Hell yet, Homer Simpson!"
Homer Simpson,"Not likely. Heh, heh."
,
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... forbidden donut.
Devil,"Well, well. Finishing something?"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Homer?! Did you eat that donut?
Homer Simpson,No.
Devil,Your wide behind won't save you this time.
Devil,"Hey, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Hey.
Lisa Simpson,Wait! Doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
Devil,"Oh you Americans with your due process and fair trials. This is always so much easier in Mexico. All right. Very well. We'll have the trial tomorrow at the stroke of midnight. 'Til then, you're going to spend the day in hell."
Homer Simpson,"Eh, that wasn't so bad."
Pieces Of Homer,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Demon Technician,"So, you like donuts, eh?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, huh."
Demon Technician,Well! Have all the donuts in the world!!
Homer Simpson,More. Mmmm.
Demon Technician,I don't understand it. James Coco went mad in 15 minutes.
,
Marge Simpson,Homer! Are you all right?
Homer Simpson,No.
Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Simpson, don't you worry. I watched Matlock in a bar last night. The sound wasn't on, but I think I got the gist of it."
Skeleton Judge,"Hear ye, hear ye! The Court of Infernal Affairs is now in session."
Lionel Hutz,"Very well. But first, some ground rules. Number one: We get bathroom breaks every half-hour."
Devil,Agreed. Number two: The jury will be chosen by me.
Lionel Hutz,"Agreed. No, wait..."
Devil,Silence! I give you... the jury of the damned.
Devil,Benedict Arnold. Lizzie Borden. Richard Nixon...
Richard Nixon,"But I'm not dead yet. In fact, I just wrote an article for Redbook."
Devil,"Hey listen, I did a favor for you."
Richard Nixon,"Yes, Master."
Devil,"John Wilkes Booth. Blackbeard the pirate. John Dillinger. And, the starting line of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers."
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard, we're low on chairs and this is the last one."
Blackbeard,"Arrr. This chair be high, says I."
Devil,"Ahem! I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson, pledging me his soul for a donut. Which I delivered! And it was scrum-diddly-umptious!"
Devil,I simply ask for what is mine.
Lionel Hutz,"That was a right pretty speech, sir. But I ask you, what is a contract? Webster's defines it as an agreement under the law which is unbreakable. Which is unbreakable. Excuse me, I must use the restroom."
,
Marge Simpson,Uh... Mr. Hutz?
Skeleton Judge,"Homer Simpson, I have no choice but to sentence you to an eternity --"
Marge Simpson,"Wait! Before you send him to hell, there's something you should see."
Marge Simpson,That's a photo of Homer and me at our wedding.
Richard Nixon,Wait a minute. You got married in an emergency room?
Marge Simpson,Well... Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding.
Marge Simpson,"Read the back, the back."
Blackbeard,Arrr... 'Tis some kind of treasure map.
Benedict Arnold,"You idiot, you can't read."
Blackbeard,"Aye, 'tis true. My debauchery was my way of compensatin'."
Benedict Arnold,"Dear Marge, you have given me your hand in marriage. All I can give you in return is my soul, which I pledge to you forever."
Lizzie Borden,"We've heard enough. Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil."
Devil,No.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Ow!
Devil,All right Simpson. You get your soul back. But let that ill-gotten donut be forever on your head.

Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,"Hello, Simpson. I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it."
Lisa Simpson,"Excuse me, Bart's a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him?"
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, where's your diaper, baby?"
Martin Prince,Thank goodness he's drawn attention away from my shirt.
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse. Milhouse, wake up. Quick, look out the window."
Milhouse Van Houten,"No way, Bart. If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies, Wet Willies, or even the dreaded Rear Admiral."
Bart Simpson,"Otto, you gotta do something! There's a gremlin on the side of the bus!"
Otto Mann,"Hey, no problem-o, Bart-dude. I'll get rid of it."
Hans Moleman,"No. Oh, no. I just made my last payment."
Bart Simpson,Eyahh! Everybody! There's a monster on the side of the bus!
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, there's no monster!"

Seymour Skinner,Gad Zooks!
Bart Simpson,"Look at the bus! I was right, I tell ya! I was right!"
Seymour Skinner,"Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive, young man. Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse will teach you some manners."
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!

Bart Simpson,At least now I can get some rest.
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad.
Homer Simpson,They're dogs! And they're playing poker!
Bart Simpson,"We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. So we just threw something together with vampires. Enjoy!"
,
Kent Brockman,"Another local peasant has been found dead, drained of his blood, with two teeth marks on his throat. This black cape was found on the scene: police are baffled."
Chief Wiggum,"We think we're dealing with a supernatural being, most likely a mummy. As a precaution, I've ordered the Egyptian wing of the Springfield Museum destroyed."
Chief Wiggum,"That's nice work, Ed."
Lisa Simpson,"No, no, they're wrong! The creature they seek is the walking undead. Nosferatu! Das Wampyre!"
Lisa Simpson,A vampire!
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh-HEH. Lisa, vampires are make-believe. Just like elves, gremlins and Eskimos."
Kent Brockman,"In a completely unrelated story, Montgomery Burns has just closed a deal to buy the Springfield Blood Bank."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I'm very excited about this deal... Oh..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Precious blood.
Homer Simpson,Hmmm... business deal.
,
,
Homer Simpson,It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... Pennsylvania.
Lisa Simpson,"Ah, there's something fishy about this whole setup."
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, stop being so suspicious. Did everyone wash their necks like Mr. Burns asked?"
Homer Simpson,Sure did.

Homer Simpson,Correction. Free blood.
Homer Simpson,Ahhh.
Lisa Simpson,Whoops. Bart and I have to go wash up.
Bart Simpson,"But, you didn't get any on m..."
Bart Simpson,Uhhh.
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, Burns isn't a vampire. And even if he was, we're not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place."
Lisa Simpson,You're probably right. Let's just go back...
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,Satisfied?
Bart Simpson,Big deal. It's no different from the basement in Grampa's rest home.
Lisa Simpson,Look!
Lisa Simpson,Oh my God!
Bart Simpson,Be be be be be.
Lisa Simpson,"Please, Bart, I've seen your stupid Shemp."
Bart Simpson,"Nyung, nyung, nyung nyung."

C. Montgomery Burns,Why Bart is right here.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. I missed you during my uneventful absence."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. Now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and TV... is."
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Come join us, Lisa. It's so cool! You get to stay up all night drinking blood!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"And if you say you're a vampire, you get a free small soda at the movies."
Lisa Simpson,No! No!
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here."
Homer Simpson,Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sist... Wait a minute! You are a vampire.
Grampa Simpson,Quick! We have to kill the boy!
Marge Simpson,How'd you know he's a vampire?
Grampa Simpson,He's a vampire?!
Bart Bat,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we gotta do something! Today he's drinking people's blood, tomorrow he could be smoking!"
Lisa Simpson,"The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns."
Homer Simpson,Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?
,
Marge Simpson,This is dangerous. I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie.
Homer Simpson,Super Fun Happy Slide!
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad."
Homer Simpson,I guess killing will be fun enough.
Lisa Simpson,You must drive this stake right through his heart.
Homer Simpson,"Take that, vile fiend!"
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, Dad, that's his crotch."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sorry."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,You're fired!
Homer Simpson,

Humorist,"Well sir, it has been an uneventful week in Badger Falls, where the women are robust, the men are pink-cheeked and the children are pink-cheeked and robust."
,
Homer Simpson,What the hell's so funny?
Humorist,"At the Apple Biscuit Cafe, where the smiles are free, don't ya know, Sven Ingqvist studied the menu. And finally, he ordered the same thing he has every day."
Bart Simpson,Maybe it's the TV.
Homer Simpson,Stupid TV. Be more funny.
Humorist,"Well sir, I think it's time to turn this pledge drive over to Troy McClure. I can't keep up this pace forever."
Troy McClure,"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such telethons as: ""Out With Gout '88!"" and ""Let's Save Tony Orlando's House!"" Folks, do you realize without your support, public television can't afford to bring you such award-winning shows as ""Edward the Penitent?"""
Edward,"I'm really, really, really sorry."
The Pope,I'm afraid sorry doesn't cut it with this Pope.
Edward,Gllllll.
Troy McClure,"What the hell...? Oooh, we got a call."

Troy McClure,Hello! What's your name?
Marge Simpson,Marge Simpson.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"I'd like to pledge thirty dollars. Oh, thank you!"

Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Ruth?"
RUTH,"Hi, Marge. I was wondering if you had a power sander I could borrow?"
Marge Simpson,That's one right there.
Homer Simpson,"All right, but remember it's mine."
Homer Simpson,That's what ballet is?
Marge Simpson,You promised. You can't back out like when you volunteered for that Army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
Scientist,"Mr. Simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum."
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh. It was worth it."
Homer Simpson,

Carl Carlson,"Hey, Homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home?"

Homer Simpson,Mmmm... invisible cola.
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. Time to stick it to the man."
Carl Carlson,"Hey careful there, Homer. I heard somebody lost an arm in there once."

Marge Simpson,"Sure, Homer. Trapped in vending machines. Okay."
Marge Simpson,Would you two like to go to the ballet?

Marge Simpson,Hey wait!

RUTH,Vyachepov's loins oughtta be outlawed.
Marge Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Far too much dancing, not nearly enough prancing."
Waylon Smithers,And a little mincing would be nice.
Marge Simpson,"Well, thank you for a lovely time."
RUTH,"You're not going home already, are you?"
Marge Simpson,It's almost nine-thirty!
RUTH,"Yeah right, we'd better turn in. Oh, you were serious."
,
Homer Simpson,I'm going to have these things on my arms forever!
Homer Simpson,Candy and sodas for all!
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... convenient.
Technician #1,"Homer, this is never easy to say. I'm gonna have to saw your arms off."
Homer Simpson,"They'll grow back, right?"
Technician #1,"Oh, yeah."
Homer Simpson,
Technician #2,"Homer, are you just holding onto the can?"
Homer Simpson,Your point being?
,
,
RUTH,I envy you and Homer.
Marge Simpson,Thank you. Why?
RUTH,"If you ever met my ex-husband, you'd understand. All he ever did was eat, sleep and drink beer."
Marge Simpson,Your point being?
RUTH,"And to top it off, he's been stiffing me on child support for the last four months."
Marge Simpson,"Well, you were unlucky, but there are a lot of good men out there."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, can I throw up in your bathroom? I'll buy somethin'."

Homer Simpson,"Marge, I know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. That's why I had the fireman write me a note."
Tough Guy,"Hey, baby, feel like getting lucky?"
Marge Simpson,"""Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."""
Homer Simpson,Lumber has a million uses.
Marge Simpson,"I'm disappointed in you, but it turns out I had a wonderful time with Ruth Powers. In fact, we're going out again tomorrow night."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's twice. I think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. You know it's hard for me to make friends."
Lady,"Heh, heh. Oh Marge, we should do this every Thursday."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I got sprayed by this skunk! Oh look, it's doing it again!"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you can't go out on Saturday. That's our special night."
Marge Simpson,What's so special about it?
Homer Simpson,"What the... Oh, I don't know... a little show called ""Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman""?!"
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Where you going?
Marge Simpson,I don't know.
Homer Simpson,When will you be home?
Marge Simpson,I'm not sure.
Homer Simpson,Where you going?
Marge Simpson,You already asked me that.
Homer Simpson,Will you bring me back something?
Marge Simpson,Don't wait up.
Homer Simpson,"How can you do this, Marge? How can you desert your children?"
Lisa Simpson,"Have a blast, Mom!"
Bart Simpson,Rock the Casbah!
Homer Simpson,"Man's best friend, indeed."
,
Marge Simpson,You look... nice.
RUTH,Tonight has nothin' to do with nice. Tonight's all about...
Tape Player,"Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows..."
RUTH,"Oh, sorry, Marge, wrong tape."
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry. You'll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover, Homina..."
Marge Simpson,"I am lucky. I have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that would be delightf... Quiet, boy! There's nothing to feel ashamed of here. Women have a right to a night out. Right, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,Sure Dad.
Homer Simpson,That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
,
Lenny Leonard,"Oh no can do Homer, I'm watchin' the game."
Lenny's Wife,"Shave up, not down, you idiot."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Ooh sounds delish. Let me just toss some jeans on and... Wait a minute! Who is this?!
,
Ned Flanders,Well howdilly dodilly-do!
Ned Flanders,Hello? Hello? Hellodilly-odilly?
,
Homer Simpson,Fine! I can have a great time all by myself!
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Dad, I think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter."
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, haven't you seen ""Home Alone?"" If some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation."
Bart Simpson,"You're absolutely right, Homer. We don't need a baby-sitter."
Homer Simpson,Wait a second...
Homer Simpson,You kids do need a baby-sitter.
Bart Simpson,Blast that infernal card! Don't give that card to me.
Homer Simpson,Here you g... Nnnnnno.
Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Simpson. I was just going through your garbage and I couldn't help overhearing that you need a baby-sitter. Of course being a highly skilled attorney, my fee is one hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour."
Homer Simpson,We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.
Lionel Hutz,Three.
Homer Simpson,Two.
Lionel Hutz,"Okay, two. And I get to keep this old bird cage."
Homer Simpson,Done.
Lionel Hutz,Still got it.
,
Marge Simpson,Oh... I've heard a lot about Shot Kickers.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,Ach. How come no one else's chair is doing this?
Tough Guy,"Listen, baby, I always get what I want."
Marge Simpson,"I said, no."
Tough Guy,"Oh, did you? Oh I completely misunderstood. Please accept our apologies."
,
Homer Simpson,Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
,
Homer Simpson,Hi guys!
Homer Simpson,"Moe, get the darts. I want to play."
Moe Szyslak,No. We're phasing out the games. People drink less when they're havin' fun.
Homer Simpson,
,
Lionel Hutz,Oh sure! Like lawyers work in big skyscrapers and have secretaries. Ha! Look at him! He's wearing a belt! That's Hollywood for you.
,
Marge Simpson,"Ooh, I've never been to an underground club."
,
Mohawk Girl,Don't you think your hair is a bit much?
Otto Mann,"Hey, Mrs. Simpson! You could try one of these smart drinks."
Otto Mann,"Oh, wow... I've wasted my life."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Would you, ahh, care to dance?"
Marge Simpson,Mayor Quimby! What are you doing here?
Mayor Joe Quimby,I'm here with my nephews.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's nice."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooooh, ""Jet!"""
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! It's Garret Morris' birthday.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,This is not a library!
,
Librarian,This is not a Kwik-E-Mart!
,
Marge Simpson,What was it you wanted to show me?
RUTH,This.
Marge Simpson,"You're not going to hunt me for sport, are you?"
RUTH,"Oh relax, Marge. I'd never turn a gun on a human being. My husband, on the other hand..."
RUTH,"Come on, you try it."
Marge Simpson,No. I couldn't.
RUTH,"Yeah, just breathe slowly and squeeze the --"
Marge Simpson,I hit it! I hit it!
Farmer,"My cans! My precious antique cans! Aw, look what ya done to 'em!"
,
RUTH,"Oh, it's getting late. Maybe we should call it a night."
Marge Simpson,"Phht, it's only midnight. Come on, I know a place."
,
RUTH,
Marge Simpson,"Beautiful, huh? Homer and I used to come up here on dates."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, stop that! It's just a weather station."
Homer Simpson,Come on Marge. It's fun to smash things. I smashed it good!
Homer Simpson,You got real purdy hair.
RUTH,"You know Marge, of all the places we've been tonight, I think I like this one the best."
Marge Simpson,Me too.
RUTH,"Look, you can see our houses."
Marge Simpson,There's an awful lot of black smoke coming from my chimney.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers?"
Lionel Hutz,"As of this moment, Lionel Hutz no longer exists. Say hello to Miguel Sanchez."
,
Marge Simpson,Maybe we should call it a night.
RUTH,Okay. I should get home to my daughter before that naked talk show comes on.
,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, young love."
,
Homer Simpson,The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I'll bash it good!
Homer Simpson,It's just no fun without Marge.
Chief Wiggum,Ahhh. There's nothing like moonshine from your own still.
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, Simpson!"
Chief Wiggum,What are you doing here?
Homer Simpson,My wife's having a girls' night out.
Chief Wiggum,"Eh, just get one of those inflatable women. But make sure it's a woman... 'Cause one time I... Eh come on, I'll uh... I'll give you a ride home."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"I miss you, Marge."
Chief Wiggum,There are ghost cars all over these highways ya know.
Chief Wiggum,"Huh, their left taillight's a little smaller than their right one. I better pull 'em over."
Marge Simpson,I think they want us to stop.
RUTH,Fat chance.
RUTH,This car is stolen.
Marge Simpson,Stolen?!
,
Chief Wiggum,Looks like we got ourselves an old fashioned car chase.
Tape Player,"SUNSHINE, LOLLIPOPS AND RAINBOWS AND EVERYTHING / THAT'S WONDERFUL IS WHAT I FEEL WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER / BRIGHTER THAN A LUCKY PENNY WHEN YOU'RE NEAR THE RAIN CLOUDS DISAPPEAR AND..."
,
Marge Simpson,"Ruth, is there something you want to tell me?"
RUTH,Remember when I said my ex-husband was behind on his child support?
Marge Simpson,Mmm hmm.
RUTH,"Yeah, well to even things up, I kind of stole his car."
Marge Simpson,Didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police?
RUTH,"Marge, you're the level-headed friend I never had."
Marge Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,"We're in pursuit of two female suspects. One is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair."
Homer Simpson,A lot of blue hair? Heh-heh. What a freak.
Homer Simpson,"It's Marge! She's become a crazed criminal, just because I didn't take her to the ballet."
Chief Wiggum,That's exactly how Dillinger got started.
Homer Simpson,Really?
,
Marge Simpson,"I don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
RUTH,"Marge, it's a matter of principle. I just can't let that deadbeat win again. You're with me, aren't ya?"
Marge Simpson,
RUTH,"Look, Marge, there's no reason for you to get dragged into this. Once we lose the cops, I'll let ya out."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. I mean these are professional lawmen and..."
Chief Wiggum,"Oh my God, it just disappeared! It's a ghost car!"
Chief Wiggum,Only if you hold me.
,
RUTH,You can call a cab in there.
Marge Simpson,"Well, bye."
RUTH,Sorry about all this. But you gotta admit we did have some fun.
Marge Simpson,Yeah. Everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
RUTH,"Hey, you're a good friend, Marge."
Woman #1,This cross country flight from the law would be hell if we didn't stick together.
Woman #2,"Hey, friends stick together."
Woman #3,It's amazing how through all this adversity we managed to stick together.
Woman #4,"If there's one thing decent folk do, it's stick together."
Waitress,I hate it when the waffles stick together.
Fry Cook,Sticking together is what good waffles do.
RUTH,"Thanks, kid."
RUTH,"Marge, what are you doing?"
Marge Simpson,"Ruth, I've done a lot of thinking, and I really consider you a friend. And an important part of friendship is..."
Marge Simpson,
Diner Owner,You stupid kid! You know that drives away all my business!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"See you tomorrow, loser."
,
Chief Wiggum,"Mmmm, engine block eggs. If we can keep these down, we'll be sittin' pretty."
Homer Simpson,That's them!
Chief Wiggum,Quiet. I can't hear the eggs.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, it's morning, and Mom and Dad aren't home yet."
Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, Mr. Hutz is still here to take care of us."
Lionel Hutz,"Hey, don't touch my stuff! Hey, this isn't the YMCA."
,
,
Chief Wiggum,"Dispatch, this is Chief Wiggum back in pursuit of the rebelling women."
Dispatcher,All right. Your current location?
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, uhhh... I'm on a road... looks to be asphalt. Aw geez, trees, shrubs, I'm directly under the Earth's sun... now."
,
Announcer,We now interrupt this program for a special bulletin.
Kent Brockman,We've just received word of a high-speed desert chase. The suspects have been identified as Ruth Powers and Marge Simpson of Springfield.
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Lisa Simpson,"I always knew some day Mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors."
Bart Simpson,"Eh, shut your yap."
Kent Brockman,"At the risk of editorializing, these women are guilty, and must be dealt with in a harsh and brutal fashion. Otherwise, their behavior could incite other women, leading to anarchy of biblical proportions. It's in Revelations, people!"
,
RUTH,"Look! We're only two miles from the state line. We're gonna make it, we're gonna be okay."
Marge Simpson,My God! That must be every policeman in Springfield!
RUTH,"That's it, I give up. A single mother can't win in a man's world."
Marge Simpson,"Ruth, that's a lot of hooey. It's not over until it's over."
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, I should have asked first."
RUTH,"No Marge, you did it! We really are gonna make it now."
Chief Wiggum,"Oh no, they're headed right for the Grand Chasm."
Homer Simpson,Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!
Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge!
Marge Simpson,Homer?!
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, I'm sorry I haven't been a better husband. I'm sorry about the time I tried to make gravy in the bathtub. I'm sorry I used your wedding dress to wax the car... And I'm sorry... Oh well let's just say I'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point."
Marge Simpson,You're right. I am lucky to have him.
Homer Simpson,"But please Marge, don't drive into that chasm!"
Marge Simpson,Chasm?!
Chief Wiggum,
,
Chief Wiggum,Ha! And to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill.
Homer Simpson,"Solid waste, I could kiss you."
Homer Simpson,"Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza."
,
Announcer,"Ruth Powers was tried in Springfield superior court. The judge dismissed her ex-husband's auto theft charges and forced him to pay all back child support. Mr. Powers blamed the outcome on his lawyer, one Lionel Hutz."
,
Announcer,"Lionel Hutz, AKA Miguel Sanchez, AKA Doctor Nguyen Van Thoc, was paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of baby-sitting. He was glad to get it."
Announcer,"Marge Simpson was charged with a violation of penal code Section 618A, wanton destruction of precious antique cans. She was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and $2,000 in punitive damages and mental anguish."
Announcer,Homer Simpson was remanded to the custody of the United States Army neuro-chemical research center at Fort Meade Maryland for extensive testing.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Quit it, Bart. Quit it. Quit it. Quit it. Mom, Bart's making faces."
Marge Simpson,"Stop that, Bart. Homer, speak to him."
Homer Simpson,Heh. Heh. Stupid animals.
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the daily newspaper."
Homer Simpson,Oooh! The Springfield Men's Shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!
Marge Simpson,"Why do you read that ""Free"" column, Homer? They never have anything good."
Homer Simpson,OH MY GOD!
Lisa Simpson,What is it?
Homer Simpson,Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!
Bart Simpson,He said what now?
Marge Simpson,Please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, you don't! That trampoline is MINE."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,
Krusty the Clown,Hey! That seltzer ain't free.
Homer Simpson,Krusty!
Krusty the Clown,That's me. You here for the trampoline?
Homer Simpson,Yeah. What's the deal?
Krusty the Clown,"Well, I used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but I'm phasing it out for more dirty limericks. There once was a man named Enos --"
Homer Simpson,And I can just haul it away? Free?
,
Krusty the Clown,Yup. It's all yours.
,
Bart Simpson,"You're a good dog, arencha, boy? Arencha?"
Homer Simpson,"Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son."
Bart Simpson,WOWWW!!
,
Bart Simpson,I can't believe it!
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering."
Bart Simpson,Look at me! /
Bart Simpson,I will never get tired of this.
Lisa Simpson,I'm going to have my wedding here.
Marge Simpson,I don't know if this is a good idea.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's the perfect exercise. It'll double the value of our house. And it was free. FREEEE!!"
Marge Simpson,Are you sure it's safe?
Homer Simpson,Absolutely! And this is just the beginning! I've got some big plans.
Milhouse Van Houten,It smells funny in there.
Homer Simpson,No it doesn't!
,
Otto Mann,
Otto Mann,
Bart Simpson,Otto! You okay?
Otto Mann,"Yeah, just pop my shoulder back in."
Otto Mann,"Thanks, buddy... Hey, I lost my turn!"
Wendell Borton,Ohh... My arm!
Ralph Wiggum,"Wee! Ow, I bit my tongue!"
Rod Flanders,Each leap brings us closer to God!
Todd Flanders,"Catch me, Lord! Catch me!"
Rod Flanders,What have we done to make God angry?
Todd Flanders,You did it!
Milhouse Van Houten,Stop jumping on me! I'm hurt!
Homer Simpson,"Kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is terrible!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. I'll take care of it."
Marge Simpson,I told you this was a bad idea!
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right! I'll get rid of the trampoline!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the..."
Krusty the Clown,You just keep right on drivin'.
Homer Simpson,There we go.
Homer Simpson,That's the last I'll see of Mr. Trampoline.
Homer Simpson,"Yep, it's finally gone."
Homer Simpson,"If this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now."
Homer Simpson,I'm thirsty.
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Checkmate, Mr. Trampoline."
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
Homer Simpson,Rust I tell ya.
Bart Simpson,Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline?
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Bart Simpson,Observe - a bike lock.
Bart Simpson,Now just turn around and count to three.
Bart Simpson,"One, two, three."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, better make it five."
Snake Jailbird,"All right, I got me a bed."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Shh! Quiet! You'll wake up Ol' Man Simpson.
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, no more trampoline."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Let's jump on the car instead.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!"
Marge Simpson,That's not true.
Homer Simpson,Name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
Marge Simpson,I can name ten things! I... I made sloppy Joes...
Homer Simpson,That's not fun!
,
Marge Simpson,Kids. Tell me the truth. Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time?
Lisa Simpson,"Um... Uh, well... Uh..."
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,I didn't realize people saw me that way.
Lisa Simpson,Are you mad?
Marge Simpson,No. I'm fine. I'm going to my sisters' now.
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, careful there, Marge! Almost nicked me!"
,
Patty Bouvier,Your blood pressure is off the chart.
,
Selma Bouvier,And I don't like this urine sample one bit.
Patty Bouvier,You're headed for a nervous breakdown. You need Brad Goodman.
Selma Bouvier,His infomercial plays round-the-clock on channel 77.
GOODMAN,"Thank you, Martha Quinn. There you have it - unrehearsed testimonies from important celebrities. She's one of my favorites. I loved her in the thing I saw her in. You know, my course can help you with every personality disorder in the ""Feel Bad"" rainbow."
GOODMAN,"Let's look at the rainbow. What's in there? Depression, insomnia, motor-mouth, darting eyes, indecisiveness, decisiveness, bossiness, uncontrollable falling down, Geriatric Profanity Disorder or GPD, and chronic nagging. Nagging, nagging, nagging..."
Selma Bouvier,"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
,
Homer Simpson,"What up, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,I'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I go outside and play?"
Marge Simpson,Shhh!
GOODMAN,"Thank you so much, Troy. And by the way, I'm not happy you're still drinking. But at least you're down to one from more than fifty. Folks, I'm often asked about my qualifications. Well, I may not have a lot of ""credentials"" or ""training."" But I'll tell you one thing -- I'm a Ph.D. in Pain. Now let me show you how you can change your life."
GOODMAN,"Troy, this circle is you."
,
Marge Simpson,"That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script."
Homer Simpson,And that sends me into a shame spiral.
Marge Simpson,"Exactly! So from now on, I'm going to quit nagging and have more fun."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh-oh. You're in for it now, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm feeling a lot of shame right now."
Marge Simpson,I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
Homer Simpson,And I feel that you hear my shame.
Marge Simpson,"I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
Homer Simpson,I feel validated by that.
Marge Simpson,Good. I'm glad we had this talk.
Homer Simpson,Me too.
Homer Simpson,"Wow! For free, ""SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM."""
Marge Simpson,Brad Goodman is coming to town!
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, you and I are fine now. Who needs Brad Goodman?"
Bart Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture."
Lisa Simpson,"We know, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"I just thought I'd remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar."
Bart Simpson,What an odd thing to say.
,
GOODMAN,"Thank you. Okay folks, let me hear what's troubling you. Don't be shy. Yell it out! Everybody, go!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"I uh, can't commit to a relationship!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm too nice!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I have problems with...
Lenny Leonard,I'm always interrupting people!
,
Flanders' Inner Child,"Stay the course, Big Ned. You're doin' super!"
Homer's Inner Child,Food goes in here.
Homer Simpson,It sure does!
Moe's Inner Child,"Hey, Moe. What's a matta? You no talka with your accent no more."
Moe Szyslak,Mamma mia!
GOODMAN,"Principal Skinner, Let's try some rage work. I want you to pretend this dummy right here is your mother."
Seymour Skinner,Okay... I'll try.
GOODMAN,"Tell this dummy mother exactly how you feel, right now."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm annoyed with you, Mother. Not just annoyed... Angry! I'm a grown man now! And I can run MY OWN LIFE!!"
GOODMAN,"Shh. Shh. Calm down. Calm down. Aw, moving. You can sit down now..."
Seymour Skinner,"We're still going antiquing on Saturday, right, mother?"
GOODMAN,"You see, folks? We're all trying to please someone else. And as soon as you're not a human BE-ING, you're a human DO-ING! Then what comes next?"
Bart Simpson,A human GOING!
Marge Simpson,Bart! Be quiet!
GOODMAN,"Son, that's wonderful. Come here. Come up here."
GOODMAN,What made you yell out that remark?
Bart Simpson,I 'unno.
GOODMAN,You just wanted to express yourself. Yes?
Bart Simpson,I do what I feel like.
GOODMAN,"That's marvelous! I-I couldn't have put it better myself. ""I do what I feel like."" People, this young man here IS the inner child I've been talking about."
Lisa Simpson,What!?
GOODMAN,"Son, you've never read any of my books, have you?"
Bart Simpson,Earth to boring guy.
GOODMAN,"That means no, eh? I'm not so old-fashioned. Your parents have done a fantastic job. Mama, Papa -- could you come up here?"
Homer Simpson,"Thank you. Very, very much."
GOODMAN,"This is really remarkable. Here we have a man with an obvious eating disorder, and a woman with a bizarre hairstyle I'm sure worn only for shock value..."
Marge Simpson,
GOODMAN,... and yet they've managed to raise an emotionally healthy son. That's fantastic.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, thank you."
GOODMAN,"We can all learn a lot from this young man, here, this... this..."
Bart Simpson,Rudiger.
GOODMAN,Rudiger. And if we can all be more like little Rudiger...
Marge Simpson,His name is Bart.
GOODMAN,"His name isn't important. What's important here is that this lad has fully developed ego integrity, with well-defined boundaries."
Bart Simpson,
GOODMAN,"Ha ha. People, I am excited. I can sense a change in the air tonight. You are all gonna start living. Really living!"
Crowd,YAAAYYY! LI-VING! LI-VING!
GOODMAN,Be like the boy!
Crowd,BE-LIKE-BOY! BE-LIKE-BOY!
GOODMAN,Just the ladies!
Women In Crowd,BE-LIKE-BOY! BE-LIKE-BOY!
GOODMAN,Now the seniors in the back!
Old Folks,WE-LIKE-ROY! WE-LIKE-ROY!
Lisa Simpson,This is madness. He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
Carl Carlson,And how!
Kent Brockman,"A new mood is in the air in Springfield, as refreshing as a pre-moistened towelette. Folks are finally accepting their feelings and really communicating, with no holding back. And this reporter thinks it's about fucking time. Of course, all these good vibes can be traced to one feisty little scamp who taught us that if it feels good, do it."
Kent Brockman,
Bart Simpson,"Lis, today I am a god."
Lisa Simpson,Is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
Bart Simpson,Ewww... uhh.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now instead of my boring old sermon, I'm going to take a page from the book of Bart and do something I've always wanted to do."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Take five, Mrs. Fische."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Wait! Wait... I can do this.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Wait! wait... hold on.
Bart Simpson,

MR. KRABAPPEL,The wireless was an invention by Guglielmo Marconi. Who can tell me what his first message was?
Milhouse Van Houten,I want-a to change-a my name-a!
Bart Simpson,It was...
Martin Prince,Our 10th caller will receive tickets to 'Supertramp'.
Bart Simpson,Aw geez. Everybody's a comedian.
,
Bart Simpson,I'm blue. Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, man."
,
Bart Simpson,"Lis, everyone in town is acting like me, so why does it suck?"
Lisa Simpson,"It's simple, Bart. You've defined yourself as a rebel. And in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted."
Bart Simpson,I see.
Lisa Simpson,"Ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity. You've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society."
Bart Simpson,What's the answer?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. May I suggest ""good-natured doormat?"""
Bart Simpson,"Sounds good, sis. Just tell me what to do."
,
Kent Brockman,"Springfield will have its first annual ""DO WHAT YOU FEEL FESTIVAL"" this Saturday whenever you feel like showing up. It'll be a welcome change from our annual ""DO AS WE SAY FESTIVAL,"" started by German settlers in 1946."
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Ach. If elected mayor, my first act will be to kill the whole lot of ye and burn yer town to cinders."
Groundskeeper Willie,I know it's on.
,
Otto Mann,Park anywhere. I'm not gonna lay any rule trip on you today.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"I feel like such a free spirit. And I'm really enjoying this so-called ""iced cream."""
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, in the spirit of the festival and everything, I'd just like to say that I... love... you."
C. Montgomery Burns,
Waylon Smithers,... In those colors.
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, who am I kidding? The boathouse was the time."
Seymour Skinner,"My God, they're naked!"
Patty Bouvier,"Double your pleasure, Springfield."
Selma Bouvier,I'm sweatin'. Let's ride through the car wash.
Captain Horatio McCallister,Arr! This picture'll serve me well on those lonely nights at sea.
Homer Simpson,This is great. I can finally look like I want and not get hassled by the man.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Cowabunga!
Bart Simpson,Skateboards? You copycat wannabes.
Bart Simpson,Ow!
Seymour Skinner,"Eat my shorts, young man."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the ""Do What You Feel Festival."" By the way, this young lady is not my wife, but I am sleeping with her. I'm telling you this because I'm comfortable with my womanizing."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"And now, to usher in this new era of feeling good, is the uh godfather of soul, James Brown."
James Brown,I FEEL GOOD / I KNEW THAT I WOULD NOW / I FEEL GOOD / I KNEW THAT I WOULD / SO GOOD SO GOOD / I GOT YOU OW!
James Brown,"Hey, wait a minute! Hold on, here. This bandstand wasn't double bolted."
Carpenter,I didn't feel like it.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I hear ya, buddy."
Marge Simpson,"Uh, I don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation, but my inner critic says you should've done your job!"
Ned Flanders,"Hey now, Marge. Let's not ""should"" this fella to death."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Yeah, next you'll be laying a guilt trip on me for not oiling that ferris wheel."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"In the spirit of the occasion, I must tell you what I think. You two screwed up royal."
Carpenter,"Ya know, I really don't feel like being blamed."
Seymour Skinner,I feel that you should shut up!
Moe Szyslak,"You know, you really irritate me, Skinner. What with your store-bought haircut and excellent posture."
Dorky Teenager,"Mister, I can't stand the sound of your voice."
Moe Szyslak,Oh really?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Oh now, now, there's no need to resort to violence."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, sure there is."
Marge Simpson,I knew it. If only I had nagged more...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,God is angry. We've made a false idol of this Brad Goodman.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, you must not blame yourself, reverend. You must blame that little boy! He started it all!"

Moe Szyslak,They're headin' for the old mill!
Homer Simpson,"No, we're not."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, let's go to the old mill anyway -- get some cider!"
Crowd,"That's a good idea. ""Cider!"" ""To the mill! There's a good view!"""
,
Homer Simpson,"Ah... boy, if only Bart had been a better role model for everyone."
Marge Simpson,That's not fair. The lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
Lisa Simpson,"No! Self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. It's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery."
Homer Simpson,That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time."
Bart Simpson,"Crank it, Homer."
Chief Wiggum,"You busted up that crack house pretty bad, McGarnigal. Did you really have to break so much furniture?"
MCGARNIGAL,"You tell me, Chief. You had a pretty good view from behind your desk."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain."
Chief Wiggum,"You're off the case, McGarnigal!"
MCGARNIGAL,"You're off your case, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,"What does that mean, exactly?"
Homer Simpson,"It means he gets results, you stupid chief."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, sit down."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sorry."
,
Atari Andre Gregory,"... thirsting for a way to name the unnameable, to express the inexpressible!"
Martin Prince,Tell me more!
Bart Simpson,"Keep cool, Simpson. Be in the game, but not of the game."
Manuel Noriega,No es bueno!
George H.W. Bush,Winners don't use drugs.
Bart Simpson,Oh. I'm out of money.
Milhouse Van Houten,Don't say that out loud.

Security Guard #1,Two Caucasian males out of money in Sector Four. Go to code red.
,
Arcade Manager,"I'm sorry, you'll have to leave."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, aw, man, how are we supposed to kill the rest of the afternoon?"
Wise Old Hobo,"You mustn't kill time, boys -- you must cherish it! Seize the day! Can I have some change, to go get loaded?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites."
Homer Simpson,"""Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" Mmmmm."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I have to go out to pick up something for dinner."
Homer Simpson,Steak?
Marge Simpson,Money's too tight for steak.
Homer Simpson,Steak?
Marge Simpson,"Sure, steak."
Homer Simpson,Ah! The last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers.
Homer Simpson,Uh oh. Something's wrong.
Homer Simpson,"Ow, pointy. Eww, slimy. Uh-oh, moving. Ah-ha!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, twenty dollars. I wanted a peanut."
Homer Simpson,Explain how.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Bart Simpson,"You know, this is wearing a bit thin."
Milhouse Van Houten,You think so?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, look!"
Bart Simpson,Maybe a plane exploded.
Milhouse Van Houten,Our prayers have been answered!
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Hello, gents. What will it be?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Apu, give us a Super-Squishee."
Bart Simpson,One that's made: entirely out of syrup.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Entirely out of... An all-syrup Super-Squishee? S-such a thing has never been done.
Bart Simpson,Just make it happen.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Oh dear...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Won't be long. She won't hold! She's breaking up! All done. If you survive, please come again."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,It's so thick.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Your turn, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Wowww... That's good Squishee.
Triple Milhouse,"What's it like, Bart? Bart? Bart...?"
Bart Simpson,
Milhouse Van Houten,Gimme that!
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh.
Bart Simpson,"OK... We're young, rich and full of sugar. What do we do?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Let's go crazy, Broadway-style!"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD!/ IT'S A HELL OF A TOWN!/ THE SCHOOLYARD'S UP AND THE SHOPPING MALL'S DOWN!/ THE STRAY DOGS GO TO THE ANIMAL POUND!"

,
,
Bart Simpson,Ohhh... my head....
Lisa Simpson,"Tsk, tsk. The remorse of the sugar junkie."
Bart Simpson,I don't remember anything.
Lisa Simpson,Really? Not even this?
Bart Simpson,"Oh, no. I must have joined the Junior Campers!"
Lisa Simpson,"The few, the proud, the geeky."
Bart Simpson,"Boy, a man on a Squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things."
,
Barney Gumble,Uh oh. Not again.
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Okay look, I made a terrible mistake. I wandered into a Junior Camper recruitment center. But what's done is done. I've made my bed and now I've got to weasel out of it."
Marge Simpson,"I know you think the Junior Campers are square and... ""uncool,"" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, don't discourage the boy. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals. Except the weasel."
,
Bart Simpson,All I've gotta do is take this uniform back after school.
Milhouse Van Houten,"You're lucky, you only joined the Junior Campers. I got a dirty word shaved into the back of my head."
Seymour Skinner,"What is it with you kids and that word? I'm going to shave you bald, young man, until you learn that hair is not a right, it's a privilege."
Nelson Muntz,"What's in the bag, wuss? Oooh, look! Camper's pampers."
Nelson Muntz,Keep-away! Keep-away!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Keep-away! Keep-away!
Bart Simpson,Yeah. Whatever.
Jimbo Jones,"You better pretend you want your uniform back, twerp."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Keep-away! Keep-away! What a baby!
Bart Simpson,"Oh no. Woe is me, my precious uniform."
Edna Krabappel,"Guess what, class!"
Martin Prince,Time for a surprise quiz?
Edna Krabappel,"Well, that's not what I was gonna say, but it's a good idea. Ha. Take out a sheet of paper, books under your desks."
Bart Simpson,
Dorky Kid,But I'm supposed to... I've got to... I'm supposed to...
Bart Simpson,"Um, Mrs. Krabappel...?"
Bart Simpson,"I'd love to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities."
Nelson Muntz,Hey look -- Sergeant Dork! Haw haw!
Bart Simpson,Enjoy your test.
Nelson Muntz,Haw ha... ugh.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hel-lo, alternative to testing!"
Ned Flanders,"Well it's Bart Simpson! C'mon in! You're just in time for ""Sponge Bath the Old Folks Day!"""
Jasper Beardly,"Help yourself, but stay above the equator."
Bart Simpson,
Ned Flanders,"Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
Bart Simpson,Nooo!
Pudgy Boy,Should I keep doing it?
,
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
Bart Simpson,"I'm outta here, man."
Ned Flanders,"Okay, now, everybody take out your Junior Campers pocketknives..."
Bart Simpson,You guys get to play with knives?
Bart Simpson,Cool! A spork!
Pudgy Boy,Don't hurt me.
Ned Flanders,"Oop, sorry, Bart, that's a Neddy no-no. You're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway?"
,
Bart Simpson,Knives are boring.
Moe Szyslak,"When I say put your beer on a coaster, I mean it."
Hans Moleman,You call that a knife? This is a knife.
Hans Moleman,Down I go.
Bart Simpson,
Martin Prince,"Oh hi, Bart. I'd gladly share these sweet cookies with you, if only you Would help me remove this ribbon."
Jimbo Jones,Here's a knife.
Martin Prince,Oh. Thank you. Now let's all share the goodness.
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Share this!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"This man's appendix is about to burst. Luckily, I have my trusty pocketknife."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Stand back!
Patient,"Thank you, Dr. Hibbert."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Don't thank me: thank the knife.
Bart Simpson,Seems like everywhere I look people are enjoying knives.
,
Bart Simpson,Don't Do What Donny Don't Does. They could've made this clearer.
Bart Simpson,They won't let you have any fun.
Homer Simpson,"Well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you should be more supportive."
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. Good work, boy."
Homer Simpson,Egghead likes his bookie wook!
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,Just tucking him in.
,
Ned Flanders,"Here you go, your rubber training knife. You've attained the rank of Pussy Willow."
Bart Simpson,Rubber knife? This place is for wimps.
Ned Flanders,"Okay, kids, now I'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation."
Bart Simpson,Hmmm...
,
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, floor pie."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Hmm.
Homer Simpson,BART!!!! Mmm... apple.
,
Bart Simpson,"The guys who wrote this show don't know squat. Itchy should have tied Scratchy's tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet-bend."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart, cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic."
,
Ned Flanders,"Howdilly hey, Camper Bart. Ready for today's meeting?"
Bart Simpson,"You know-it-know it, Neddy."
Chief Wiggum,You see anything yet?
Ned Flanders,"Okilly dokilly. Now, our annual Father-Son Rafting Trip is next weekend."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip?"
Homer Simpson,"Dah, I am the captain. My son is Bart."
Fathers,What an oaf. / How embarrassing.
Kid,Glad he's not my father.
Bart Simpson,
Ned Flanders,"Oh Warren, I know your Dad is in prison, but don't you fret. A special Celebrity Dad has been arranged for ya."
Kid,But my older brother would like to...
Ned Flanders,"Sorry, but I'm afraid Ernest Borgnine has already been confirmed."
Ernest Borgnine,"Hiya. I'm sure you kids know me best as Sergeant Fatso Judson in ""From Here to Eternity."""
Kids,Yay!
,
,
Homer Simpson,"How was jerk practice, boy? Did they teach you how to sing to trees and build crappy furniture out of useless wooden logs? Huh?"
Homer Simpson,Stupid poetic justice...!
Bart Simpson,"Actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip."
Homer Simpson,Heh heh. You don't have a son.
,
Bart Simpson,"Look, Homer won't want to go, so just ask him, and he'll say no. Then it'll be his fault."
,
Homer Simpson,"I don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, I'll just say yes."
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip."
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I really want you to come on this trip with me!"
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!"

Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? Want me to Zinc your sniffer?"
,
Ned Flanders,"I guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh?"
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,You are not my son.
Ned Flanders,Now what happened to that gosh darn map I brought?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I dunno. But lucky for you somebody here is responsible."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's a new Mexico."
Ned Flanders,"Whoa, Nelly!"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, quick, Homer! Which way do we turn--?"
Homer Simpson,So many Krustyburger locations.
Ned Flanders,Uh-oh... no time.
Ned Flanders,"Matthew, Mark, Luke-and-John!"
Ernest Borgnine,"Hey, where are the sissy and the bald guy going, HUH?"
Ned Flanders,"Paddle harder, Homer. We gotta fight the current."

Homer Simpson,Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!
Ned Flanders,"Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope."
Homer Simpson,"Oh pardon me, Mr. Let's Ration Everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? Don't you know the poem? ""Water, water everywhere/ So let's all have a drink."""
Bart Simpson,Homer! No!
Homer Simpson,Ohh... What does it matter? We're doomed!
Lenny Leonard,Run! We'll hide at my house!
Ned Flanders,"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, I'll just be in charge of the rationing."
Homer Simpson,"Observe, boy. The secret is to take tiny bites, like so:"
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD!
Homer Simpson,Why couldn't I be on one of the smart rafts. I bet they're having the time of their life.

Chief Wiggum,"I keep telling you, lady, your husband and son have to be missing for a week before we can start searching. I'd like to help sooner, I would, but we're very, very busy down here."
Chief Wiggum,King me.

Marge Simpson,Still no help.
Patty Bouvier,"You know, it is cougar season. And those things don't mess around."
Marge Simpson,

Bart Simpson,A rescue plane! Get the flare gun!
Homer Simpson,"This ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, Flanders. This is the Real Thing..."
Homer Simpson,"All right, well that's okay. When they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us."
Homer Simpson,

Ned Flanders,"You know, Homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food."
Homer Simpson,You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.
Ned Flanders,"Godspeed, li'l doodle."
Homer Simpson,He'll be back.
Homer Simpson,"Here fishy, fishy, fishy. We're waiting."
Homer Simpson,"Son, there's something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now."
Bart Simpson,A real Swiss army knife. Cool!
Homer Simpson,I stole it from that Borgnine guy.
,
Ernest Borgnine,"Don't worry, kids, I'll take care of him with my trusty..."
Ernest Borgnine,Uh... uh... Um.. Uh... Hmm...
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug."
Homer Simpson,Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...
Bart Simpson,"Dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence."
Homer Simpson,The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too."
Homer Simpson,According to this map there's a Krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
Ned Flanders,"That's what you're smelling, Homer! Oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
Homer Simpson,Never mind the fog! That way. Steer! There isn't much time!
,
Krusty the Clown,I'm taking a bath on this!
Accountant,We tried to tell you these are unmanned oil rigs.
Krusty the Clown,Close the damn thing down! No one's ever gonna come.
Homer Simpson,Give seven hundred Krustyburgers!
Counter Boy,You want fries with that?
Bart Simpson,"You did it, Dad! You saved us! I'm proud you're my father."

Ernest Borgnine,"THERE WAS A FARMER WHO HAD A DOG, AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O..."
Kids,AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O.

Seymour Skinner,"Oh don't worry, she'll hear about this."

Edna Krabappel,"Class, I know there's no way to prove who actually did this, and in our American Democracy, everyone is innocent until proven guilty."
Bart Simpson,God bless America.
Edna Krabappel,But my classroom is not a democracy. Ha. For the rest of the year Bart Simpson will be the first student called on for every question.
Edna Krabappel,"Well, let's get started."
Edna Krabappel,"Can someone pronounce this word? Hmm, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,
Martin Prince,"Pick me, teacher. I'm ever so smart."
Martin Prince,It's photosynthesis! Damn your feeble brain!
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I couldn't read it. The letters are all blurry."
Edna Krabappel,Is it possible all your misbehavior and miserable grades have been caused by a simple vision disorder?
Bart Simpson,"You mean it ain't me noggin, it's me peepers? Well that's just loverly."
,
Homer Simpson,"Watch this, guys."
Worker,
Lenny Leonard,"Uh oh, he's done for."
Carl Carlson,"Don't worry, the safety glass will protect us."

Carl Carlson,There's no way out! There's no way out! We're doomed. Dooomed!
Charlie,"Well sir, I won't bore you with the details of our miraculous escape. But we desperately need a real emergency exit."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why that's a fabulous idea. Anything else you'd like? How about real lead in the radiation shields? Urinal cakes maybe? Smithers, throw this at him."
Charlie,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, where does that tube go?"

C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent, Zutroy. Work hard and each day you'll get a shiny penny."
Agent #1,"Agent Wesson, Department of Labor. This man's an illegal alien."
C. Montgomery Burns,That's preposterous. Zutroy here is as American as apple pie.
Zutroy,"Dok nee grabb ga, Mr. Burns."
Agent #2,This plant violates every labor law in the book. We found a missing Brazilian soccer team working in your reactor core.
C. Montgomery Burns,That plane crashed on my property!
Agent #1,"Look, Mr. Burns. We want to see some changes. For starters, you can reverse your sexist employment policies and hire at least one woman."
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, I'll bring in a woman. But I still stand by my hiring policies."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Get back to work, Stuart!"

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now with my new HMO I can provide every medical service you'll ever need under one roof. You do have insurance, don't you?"

Optometrist,"Your son has a temporary condition called ""lazy eye,"" where one eye is weaker than the other. You'll have to wear these for two weeks."
Bart Simpson,
Optometrist,"Menachem Begin wore a pair just like them. Hmmm, that scalp's a little dry. Better see our dermatologist."

Podiatrist,"Ah, these should help those fallen arches. Enjoy."

Internist,"Hmmm, throat looks a little red. I'd better spray it."

Lenny Leonard,"Aw, if they hire a woman we won't be able to spit on the floor."
Carl Carlson,And we can't take off our pants when it gets real hot.
Homer Simpson,And we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain.
Homer Simpson,I mean... you know if we wanted to... not that I... ever did.
Waylon Smithers,"Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet your new co-worker, Mindy Simmons. I think she has a degree in engineering or something."

Moe Szyslak,That's the worst name I ever heard.
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Joey Joe Joe!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what the hell, it's me. I'm attracted to another woman. What am I going to do?"
Barney Gumble,"""Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. Talk to the woman, and you'll realize you have nothing in common."""
Homer Simpson,Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?
Barney Gumble,It was on one of these bar napkins.

Homer Simpson,"Uh, so. Let's have a conversation. Uh, I think we'll find we have very little in common."
Mindy,Can't talk... eating.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze."
Mindy,Double glaze.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so we have one thing in common. But you know what I hate? Drinking beer and watching TV."
Mindy,Not me. That's my idea of heaven.
Homer Simpson,Me too.
Mindy,"Really? I can see I'm gonna love working with you. Well, gotta go. I wanna sneak in a quick nap before lunch."
Homer Simpson,"Foul temptress! I'll bet she thinks Ziggy's gotten too preachy, too."
Homer Simpson,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.

Homer Simpson,I mean hello!
Mindy,I guess we'll be going down together. I mean getting off together. I mean...

Homer Simpson,Hey! We haven't watched TV in awhile.
Kent Brockman,"Tonight Eye on Springfield takes a look at the secret affairs of Kennedy, Eisenhower, Bush, and Clinton. Did fooling around on their wives make them great? We'll find out next when we play ""Hail to the Cheat."""

Sexy Woman Announcer,Examine your scalp for ringworm.

Homer Simpson,Hello hotline? I am very tempted by another woman.
Ned Flanders,"Homer Simpson! That's a dilly of a pickle. Hey, let's conference you with Marge, huh?"
Homer Simpson,Nooo!
Homer Simpson,Who are you?
Angel,"Homer, I'm your guardian angel. I've assumed the form of someone you would recognize and revere - Sir Isaac Newton."
Homer Simpson,Sir Isa-who?
Angel,"Oh, very well."
Homer Simpson,Col. Klink! Did you ever get my letters?
Angel,I'm not actually Col. Klink. I'm just assuming his form.
Homer Simpson,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. Did you know Hogan had tunnels all over your camp?"
Angel,Ho-MER! That's not why I'm here. My job is to show you how miserable life would be if you married Mindy instead of Marge.
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I would live in a big mansion?"
Mindy,"I'm so happy, darling."
Homer Simpson,"I, as well. Are you happy, Jeeves?"
Jeeves,"Yes, sir. Quite."
Homer Simpson,Then we're all happy.
Angel,Let's get out of here!

Mindy,"Homer, you don't have to do anything you don't want to."
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe I want to. But then I think about Marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. Sometimes I'd just like to..."

Professor,"Yes I would, Kent."
Chief Wiggum,"Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen please, we have a major break in the case. We recovered the burglar's handkerchief from one of the crime scenes. Now one sniff of this baby and our tracking dog will be hot on his trail. Gosh, look at me, I'm sweating like a pig here..."

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Thank you for coming. I'll see you in Hell.
,
Homer Simpson,"Alright, these are our new family security rules: Be home before dark, and make sure you're not followed, lock all doors and windows."
Marge Simpson,And don't take candy from strangers.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, they're only human."
Lisa Simpson,What's the point of all these precautions? I've already lost the only thing that matters to me.
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. I got you another instrument."
Lisa Simpson,"What, this jug?"
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down."
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, honey. I didn't realize how much that horn meant to you. Don't worry. Daddy's gonna get it back. I don't know how, but I'll figure out something."
Lisa Simpson,Thank you.
Homer Simpson,"You know Lisa, music helps daddy think."
,
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, you're that drunken posse. Wow, can I join you?"
Homer Simpson,I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?
Jimbo Jones,Can I?!
Ned Flanders,"Welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, I think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
Everyone,
Ned Flanders,"Now, who should lead the group?"
Voice From The Back,You!
Everyone,Yeah! Flanders! Flanders! Flanders!
Ned Flanders,"I don't really have very much experience, but I'll be---"
Moe Szyslak,Someone else!
Crowd,Yeah! Someone else! Someone else! Someone else!
Homer Simpson,I'm someone else!
Lenny Leonard,He's right!
Homer Simpson,"We don't need a thinker, we need a doer. Someone who'll act without considering the consequences."
Crowd,Homer! Homer! Homer!
Barney Gumble,"I'm with you, Homer."
Captain Horatio McCallister,"I be with ya too, matey."
Seymour Skinner,"I'm with you, Homer."
Moe Szyslak,"You're the man, Homer."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,You're so good.
Otto Mann,"You're the man, man."
Grampa Simpson,I'll join! I'm filled with piss and vinegar. At first I was just filled with vinegar...
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Dad. You're too old."
Grampa Simpson,"Too old! Why that just means I have experience. Who chased the Irish out of Springfield Village in ought four? Me, that's who!"
IRISH PETE,And a fine job ye did too!
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. Aren't they? Aren't they? Huh? Yes they are. Yes they are..."
Grampa Simpson,Stop it! It's a form of abuse!
Marge Simpson,"I don't think the guns are a good idea, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're responsible adults and..."
Moe Szyslak,Oops.
Homer Simpson,... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
Captain Horatio McCallister,Sorry.
Seymour Skinner,Uh-oh!
Moe Szyslak,Me again.
Bart Simpson,Sorry.
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I'll be ""Cueball."" Skinner can be ""Eightball"", Barney will be ""Twelveball,"" and Moe, you can be ""Cueball."""
Moe Szyslak,You're an idiot.
,
Herman Hermann,"So, wedding, huh?"
Homer Simpson,"No, we're forming a vigilante group."
Herman Hermann,Come with me.
,
Herman Hermann,"See, it's a miniature version of the A-bomb. The government built it in the fifties to drop on beatniks."
Beatnik Poet,Radiant cool crazy nightmare. Zen New Jersey nowhere.
Homer Simpson,Put this in your pipe and smoke it.
Beatnik Poet,How now brown bureaucrats.
Homer Simpson,Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo, hoo! Take that Maynard G. Krebs!"
Herman Hermann,"Hey, see this sign?"
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, men, it's time to clean up this town."
Seymour Skinner,Meaning what exactly?
Homer Simpson,"You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, give me that megaphone of yours."
Bart Simpson,"It's not just a megaphone, Dad. It's a RapMaster 2000."
Homer Simpson,Never mind the commercials. Just give it to me. I've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.
Homer Simpson,Move along there.
Twelve-year-old,It's Hammer!
Homer Simpson,Return to your homes and places of businesses!
Homer Simpson,"Hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?"
Student,Sears.
Homer Simpson,Get him!
,
Homer Simpson,No burning leaves without a permit!
Man,I got one.
Homer Simpson,Too late.
Homer Simpson,"You better have a good reason for doing that, boy."
Jimbo Jones,It makes me feel like a big man.
Homer Simpson,You're in. Here's the sack.
Moe Szyslak,But you gotta supply your own knobs.
,
Homer Simpson,"So I said to him, ""Look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that."""
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? I mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?"
Homer Simpson,I 'unno. Coast Guard?
Marge Simpson,"Homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar?"
Lisa Simpson,And I still don't have my saxophone.
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas."
Homer Simpson,Literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination...
Lisa Simpson,World domination?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that might be a typo."
,
Kent Brockman,"Mr. Simpson, how do you respond to the charge that petty vandalism such as graffiti is down 80 percent, while heavy sack beatings are up a shocking 900 percent?"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty percent of all people know that."
Kent Brockman,"I see. Well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Kent, I'd be lying if I said my men weren't committing crimes."
Kent Brockman,TouchÃ©.
Kent Brockman,"Well, it looks like we have our first caller. And I mean ever, because this is not a call-in show. Hello, you're on the air."
Cat Burglar,"Hello, Kent. Hello, Homer, my arch nemesis."
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
Cat Burglar,"Uh, you do realize who this is..."
Homer Simpson,Uh... Marge?
Cat Burglar,"No, Homer, I'm not your wife, although I do enjoy her pearls. As a matter of fact, I'm holding them right now. Listen."
Homer Simpson,Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!
Kent Brockman,"Homer, that's our stage manager!"
Homer Simpson,Oh sorry. I'm a little nervous.
Cat Burglar,"It may interest you to know that for my next crime I'll be pinching the pride and joy of the Springfield Museum, the world's largest cubic zirconia."
Homer Simpson,"Listen, Mr. Cat Burglar, I vow to go without sleep and guard the Springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time."
Homer Simpson,We'll be right back.
Kent Brockman,I get to say that.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg."
Homer Simpson,"Dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. Just stand around and don't steal anything."
Homer Simpson,Hey!
Grampa Simpson,We're on our break!
Seymour Skinner,Any sign of the burglar yet?
Homer Simpson,He'll show.
Seymour Skinner,How's that?
Homer Simpson,It's his job.
Seymour Skinner,How's that?
Homer Simpson,He's a burglar.
Homer Simpson,"Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? There's just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
Kids,Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
,
Homer Simpson,Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep! I was drunk!
Bart Simpson,"I believe you, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do."
,
Barney Gumble,"Go home, Simpson."
Jimbo Jones,"You let me down, man. Now I don't believe in nothing no more. I'm going to law school."
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, maybe this will cheer you up."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this doesn't work any more."
Homer Simpson,I didn't say stop.
,
Marge Simpson,Oh my! I had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia.
Grampa Simpson,Let me through! Coming through!
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Grampa. They pelted you too?"
Grampa Simpson,No. Actually I fell down at the Big Boy.
Grampa Simpson,"Son, I've come to help you. I know who the cat burglar is."
Lisa Simpson,What? Who? Huh? What?
Grampa Simpson,"Well, well, well. Before I was too old and no one wanted my help. Suddenly, look who comes to old Grampa for--wait! Where're you going?"
Grampa Simpson,Come back. I'll tell you.
Grampa Simpson,He was right under my nose the whole time. He lives in my retirement home. His name is Molloy.
Lisa Simpson,"Wow! How'd you track him down, Grampa?"
Grampa Simpson,Good question.
,
Grampa Simpson,On one of my frequent trips to the ground... I noticed Molloy wore sneakers.
Grampa Simpson,For sneaking! My next clue came just yesterday at the museum. We felt slighted by your age-bashing and started home.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Molloy said, 'I'll catch up with you.'"
Grampa Simpson,"I couldn't quite put my finger on it. There was something strange about the way he walked. Much more vertical than usual. And finally, Molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad, I could kiss you."
Grampa Simpson,Well kiss me right here. It's the only part that still has feeling.
,
Homer Simpson,No wait! I know where the burglar is!
Grampa Simpson,To the retirement home!
Crowd,Hooray!
,
Seymour Skinner,And there she is: the world's largest cubic zirconia.
Moe Szyslak,What an eyesore.
Homer Simpson,"So, Mr. Molloy. It seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him."
Seymour Skinner,How ironic.
Molloy,"Homer old chum. Well done. If anyone was going to catch me, I'm glad it was you."
Homer Simpson,"Actually, it wasn't me. It was my Dad, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,"Thanks, son. So you see old people aren't so useless after all. Molloy's old and he outsmarted the lot of ya. And I'm even older and I outsmarted him."
Moe Szyslak,Shut up.
Grampa Simpson,I've had my moment.
Molloy,"And of course, I'm happy to return all of your treasured possessions."
Molloy,"Selma, my dear, your lock of MacGyver's hair."
Selma Bouvier,Thank you. I'll add it to the ball.
Molloy,"And little Lisa, here's your saxophone."
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you. And thank you, Dad. You got it back, just like you said you would."
Molloy,"I sincerely regret any inconvenience I may have caused. And although I have stolen your material goods, let me assure you that your dear town has stolen my heart."
Crowd,Awwwww.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, he's so charming!"
Barney Gumble,Let's let him go.
Crowd,Yeah!
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, sorry, folks. Gee, I really hate to spoil this little love-in, but Mr. Molloy broke the law. And when you break the law, you gotta go to jail."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Uh, that reminds me, uh, here's your monthly kickback."
Chief Wiggum,"You just, you couldn't have picked a worse time."
,
Homer Simpson,I caught the cat burglar. I caught the cat burglar. That means you. You are the cat burglar.
Molloy,I suppose you're wondering where I hid all the millions of dollars I stole over the years.
Homer Simpson,Shut up.
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, wait a minute. Maybe we should uh, hear him out. Where'd you hide the loot, Molloy?"
Molloy,"It's buried right here in Springfield, under a Big T."
Homer Simpson,No kidding.
Chief Wiggum,"Big T, huh?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I'll be going to my home now and... sleep."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, me too. I will also go home for sleep."
,
Homer Simpson,Lemme through! I gotta find a Big T. There's millions of dollars buried under a Big T!
,
Chief Wiggum,We need more information.
Molloy,It's buried at 4723 Maple Valley Road.
Molloy,"Ah, you take highway 201 south for 15 minutes... take a left at the left."
Barney Gumble,"Oh, that was fun, ladies!"
Driver,"Whatsa matter with you, kid? You told me the stream was shallow. Why you... oh kid... I'll kill you..."
Kent Brockman,"Hordes of panicky people seem to be evacuating the town for some unknown reason. Professor, without knowing precisely what the danger is, would you say it's time for our viewers to crack each other's heads open and feast on the goo inside?"
Professor,"Yes I would, Kent."
,
Otto Mann,"Whoa, I found something!"
Chief Wiggum,It's just a piece of paper.
Homer Simpson,It's mine!
Homer Simpson,"""Frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. I have already used this time to escape from your jail. Fondest wishes."" Oh, I can't make out this signature."
Mayor Joe Quimby,Keep digging. We're bound to find something.
Mayor Joe Quimby,Hmmm. I guess we're not gonna find anything.
Otto Mann,"Uh, how're we gonna get outta here?"
Homer Simpson,We'll dig our way out!
Chief Wiggum,"No, no! Dig up, stupid!"
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the morning horoscope. ""Today will be a day like every other day."" It just gets worse and worse."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune."
Bart Simpson,"Jawohl, mein mommandant."
Lisa Simpson,Why are you so happy?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you kids gotta go to school. I gotta go to work. The only one who has it easy is Marge."
,
Lisa Simpson,"You're right, Bart. School is for losers."
,
Lisa Simpson,"And that's how I cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of TV's ""Facts Of Life"", including long time hold-out, Tootie."
Bart Simpson,Sounds like another Pulitzer for me to polish.
Lisa Simpson,"Hush, field trip boy."
Lisa Simpson,Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize. How ironic.
Bart Simpson,"Yo! Lis! Lis! Come back, Lis! Come back!"
Lisa Simpson,Why? I'm so much happier here.
,
,
Edna Krabappel,And now Principal Skinner will tell us where we'll be going on this year's field trip.
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you, Edna, everyone. Now class... I wonder who among you can tell me what this is?"
Edna Krabappel,"Not the box factory again, Seymour."
Martin Prince,This may well prove fascinating.
Bart Simpson,"I know, I'll just do like Lisa and escape into fantasy."
Seymour Skinner,"Class, instead of going to the box factory, today we'll be going to the... box factory."
Bart Simpson,"Damn TV, you've ruined my imagination just like you've ruined my ability to... to um, uh... oh well."
Bart Simpson,
,
Martin Prince,FIFTY-SIX BOXES OF BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL / FIFTY-SIX BOXES OF BOTTLES OF BEER / YOU TAKE ONE DOWN AND PASS IT A-ROUND/ FIFTY-FIVE BOXES OF BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL!
,
Seymour Skinner,Ohhh!
Box Executive,"The story of how two brothers - and five other men - parlayed a small business loan into a thriving paper goods concern is a long and interesting one. And here it is. It all began with the filing of form 637 slash A, the application for a small business or farm..."
Box Executive,Many interesting and important things have been put into boxes over the years. Textiles... other boxes... even children's candy.
Milhouse Van Houten,Do any of these boxes have candy in 'em?
Box Executive,No.
Milhouse Van Houten,Will they ever?
Box Executive,No. We only make boxes to ship nails. Any other questions?
Martin Prince,"When will we be able to see a finished box, sir?"
Box Executive,"Oh, we don't assemble 'em here. That's done in Flint, Michigan."
Bart Simpson,Have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?
Box Executive,No...
Bart Simpson,...And then the hand started crawling around and tried to strangle everybody?
Box Executive,"No, that has never happened."
Bart Simpson,Any popped eyeballs?
Box Executive,I'm not sure what kind of factory you're thinking of. We just make boxes here.
Box Executive,This room is the most popular part of our tour.
Milhouse Van Houten,It's just like the other rooms.
Box Executive,"Yes, but with one important difference. Oh. We took that out. Yes, it is just like the other rooms."
Milhouse Van Houten,What's that building over there?
Box Executive,"That's just the TV studio where they film Krusty the Clown and other non-box-related programs. Since it has nothing to do with boxes, I'll just shut these blinds."
Kids,
Box Executive,"Now here's my office. If you will direct your eyes to the floor, you'll see a yellow line. Follow it. It will lead you around my desk ...and back out the door."
Bart Simpson,I gotta get outta here.
Bart Simpson,Aha! The perfect escape!
,
Security Guard,"Do you work here, little boy?"
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Security Guard,"Well then go right in, sir."
,
All,Bart! / Where are you!
Seymour Skinner,I'll handle this. Simpson! I'm giving you 'til the count of three to come out. One... two... three. I've done all I can do.
Edna Krabappel,We'd better call his parents.
,
Marge Simpson,Just a minute! Don't hang up!
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Buzz off, Giuseppe."
Edna Krabappel,No answer at home. I'll call his father.
,
Homer Simpson,"Just a minute! Don't hang up! Y'ello... you'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel."
,
Director,Action!
Bumblebee Man,"Ayy yi yi! No me gusta! I'm sorry, I'm really not comfortable with this, Ethan."
Director,"What's the matter, love?"
Bumblebee Man,"It's just, it's it's the same old tired gags, isn't it? I mean, let's give the audience some credit."
Director,How 'bout a giant mouse trap?
Bumblebee Man,I love it!
Director,Action!
Bumblebee Man,"Ayy yi yi! No me gusta! Ay, it's grande."
,
Homer Simpson,What do you mean you lost him?! He might have fallen into one of these machines!
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! That's his lucky red hat!
Homer Simpson,He's a box! My boy's a box! Damn you! A boooxxx!
,
Krusty the Clown,I said I wanted a Danish.
Intern,"I'm sorry, all the Danishes are gone."
Krusty the Clown,"They're not gone, you're gone!"
Kent Brockman,"Hmm, mm, mm, tragic news tonight, one hundred and twenty dead in a tidal wave in Kuala Lala...peer... Kuala La Lum... par... France."
Bart Simpson,Yoink!
Kent Brockman,Yoink?
Kent Brockman,
Krusty the Clown,Aw heck... now where am I going to get a Danish?
Bart Simpson,"Here's a Danish, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,"Gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Krusty the Clown,Now that's Danish. Where'd you get it?
Bart Simpson,I stole it from Kent Brockman.
Krusty the Clown,"Great. He didn't touch it, did he?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Krusty the Clown,"Good job, kid. What's your name?"
Bart Simpson,I'm Bart Simpson. I saved you from jail.
Krusty the Clown,
Bart Simpson,I reunited you with your estranged father.
Bart Simpson,"Yes, Krusty?"
Bart Simpson,"I saved your career, man! Remember your comeback special?"
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, well what have you done for me lately?"
Bart Simpson,I got you that Danish.
Krusty the Clown,And I'll never forget it.
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, kid!"
Bart Simpson,Wow! A big clown hankie!
Krusty the Clown,"It's a towel, you yutz. I want you to wash it. You're my new assistant."
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Kent Brockman,"Yeah, I know I'm on, but I don't care. I don't read the news until I get my Danish. Go ahead, try to find a replacement."
Bumblebee Man,A powerful tidal wave in Kuala Lumpur has killed one hundred and twenty people. Ai chihuahua! Whoa whoa whoa!
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have some horrible, bone chilling news."
Marge Simpson,What is it?
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, nothing."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip. Think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?"
Bart Simpson,"Well that'll always be the dream, but for now I got a job in the show business. From now on I'll be helping Krusty the clown after school."
Marge Simpson,"I don't know, Bart. You're only ten."
Lisa Simpson,I've got a weekend job helping the poor. And I'm only eight.
Homer Simpson,That's not a job. It's a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin'! What satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!
Bart Simpson,"So, anyway, can I, Mom? Can I take the job?"
Marge Simpson,Well...
Homer Simpson,Why not? I remember my first after-school job. I was in a band.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, everybody. I'm Archie Bell and I'm also the Drells. We got a new song called, 'Tighten Up' and this is the music you tighten up with."
Organ Grinder,"Hey, what's a-matter with you, you crazy kid? You a-chasin' away my a-business."
Organ Grinder,"Hey, Pepe, go for the face!"
Homer Simpson,"Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'm asking if I can get a job."
Homer Simpson,"Gig, son. When you're a musician, a job is called a gig."
,
Bart Simpson,"Wow, being in show business is like a dream. We're really lucky, aren't we?"
Stagehand,I wish I was dead.
Krusty the Clown,"Don't listen to him, kid. This is a dream factory. The birthplace of magic and enchantment. Now, I need you to go and clean out my toilet."
,
Krusty the Clown,"Right in here, boy. Eww. I don't know WHAT I was thinking last night. This'll take you a couple hours."
,
Bart Simpson,"I'm telling ya, I do work on the Krusty show. Look at the credits."
Krusty the Clown,"Bye, bye kids!"
Kids In Audience,Yayyyyyy!
Kent Brockman,"I'm Kent Brockman, on the eleven o'clock news tonight...a certain kind of soft drink has been found to be lethal, we won't tell you which one until after sports and the weather with funny Sonny Storm."
Bart Simpson,There's my name. Right there. Bart Simpson.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Looks more like ""Brad Storch""."
Martin Prince,"No, it says ""Betty"". ""Betty Symington""."
Nelson Muntz,That's for taking credit for other people's work.
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks Dad, that's great advice."
Homer Simpson,"Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"There, there."
,
Little Girl,"Would you sign my picture, Krusty?"
Krusty the Clown,Sure kid. Get in line.
Little Girl,"I love you, Krusty!"
Krusty the Clown,Over there.
,
Edna Krabappel,"Okay, kids, open your books to page sixty..."
Krusty the Clown,"Bart, I need to get your fingerprints on a candlestick. Meet me in the conservatory. Chop chop. Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right."
Bart Simpson,I wish I was dead.
,
Sideshow Mel,Bah! There's cheese in this sandwich! Surely you know I'm lactose intolerant.
Bart Simpson,Sorry.
Sideshow Mel,Sorry! Do you know how sick this is going to make me? Oooh boy. Come stand next to the bathroom door. I want to yell at you some more.
,
Sideshow Mel,
Bart Simpson,Show business sucks. I'm outta here.
Krusty the Clown,Bart! I need to use you in a sketch.
Bart Simpson,You want me to be on the show?
Krusty the Clown,"It's just one line. Mel was supposed to say it, but he's dead."
Bart Simpson,Dead?
Krusty the Clown,"Or sick. I dunno, I forget. Anyway, all you gotta do is say ""I am waiting for a bus."" Then I hit you with pies for five minutes. Got that?"
Bart Simpson,I am waiting for a bus.
Krusty the Clown,Makes me laugh. Let's go.
Bart Simpson,I am waiting for a...
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it.
,
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, man. It's a miracle we got through that one. Remind me never to let you on stage again, kid. Some people got it, some people don't. And you, my young friend, do not have... hold on, I want to finish this thought outside..."
,
Crowd Member,It's that kid!
2nd Crowd Member,"It's the ""I didn't do it"" guy!"
Krusty the Clown,He's mine. I own him and all the subsidiary rights.
,
Krusty the Clown,"Why this rickety ladder, in front of this door is the perfect place for this priceless Ming vase."
Krusty the Clown,...Eh? ...Eh?
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it.
Krusty the Clown,"Thank you. Thank you. And now, the ""I didn't do it"" Dancers."
Snake Jailbird,"Don't move, dude. This is totally a gun."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I didn't do it!
Mayor Joe Quimby,Honey!
Mrs. Quimby,"Joe, how could you?"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"I uh, didn't do it."
Man,Help! Help!
Fireman,This is the third time that this building has burned down because someone has been smoking in bed.
Selma Bouvier,I didn't do it.
,
Lisa Simpson,This biography of Bart came out awfully quickly. It's not even about him.
Bart Simpson,Sure it is. Look at the cover.
Lisa Simpson,But inside it's mostly about Ross Perot. And the last two chapters are excerpts from the Oliver North trial.
Homer Simpson,Ah. Oliver North. He was just poured into that uniform.
Marge Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,I DIDN'T DO IT / I DIDN'T DO IT.
Hammer,"Hey, proper."
,
,
Grampa Simpson,I have to pay to see my own grandson. That's the Democrats for ya.
Krusty the Clown,"See the boy, five dollars, or call him twenty-four hours-a-day on Bart Chat."
,
Barney Gumble,Bart Chat?
Little Girl,Are you Bart?
Barney Gumble,"Sure I am. ""I didn't do nothing."""
Little Girl,"Uh, isn't it, ""I didn't do it?"""
Barney Gumble,"Yeah, whatever."
,
Bart Simpson,"Uh... I never thought I'd say this, but shouldn't we be learning something?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Say the line, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it?
Edna Krabappel,Yayyyyy!
,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Lisa. Say something funny."
Lisa Simpson,Like what?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, something stupid like Bart would say. Bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. Something like that."
Announcer,Brought to you by...
Dog,
Lisa Simpson,"Forget it, Dad. If I ever become famous, I want it to be for something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad."
Bart Simpson,Obnoxious fad?
Homer Simpson,"Aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about Urkel... that little snot. Boy I'd like to smack that kid."
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you readin' books for?
Bart Simpson,I'm doing the Conan O'Brien show and I wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about.
Homer Simpson,"Don't forget to say ""I didn't do it""."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, there's more to me than just a catchphrase."
Homer Simpson,How do you figure boy?
Bart Simpson,Watch the Conan O'Brien show. You'll see.
Homer Simpson,"All right, but after Leno I'm all laughed out you know."
,
Bart Simpson,"You know, Conan, I have a lot to say. I'm not just a one line wonder. Did you know that a section of rainforest the size of Kansas is burned every single..."
CONAN,Just do the line.
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it.
CONAN,Great material. We'll be right back.
CONAN,Sit perfectly still. Only I may dance.

Bart Simpson,Do the line. Just do the line. What's gonna happen to me?

Krusty the Clown,One at a time! No Teamsters!
Homer Simpson,That dog can sell anything.
Marge Simpson,"Honey, I know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over, but you shouldn't. You're making people happy. And that's a very hard thing to do."
Bart Simpson,"You're right, mom. I shouldn't let this bother me. I'm in television now. It's my job to be repetitive... my job, my job. Repetitiveness is my job. I am gonna go out there tonight and give the best performance of my life."
Marge Simpson,The best performance of your life?
Bart Simpson,The best performance of my life.
,
Krusty the Clown,Where is that lousy little pisher?... Bart.
Krusty the Clown,And now... boys and girls... here he is... the boy that says the words you've been longing to hear like the salivating dogs that you are... Bart Simpson!
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it!
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it.
Bart Simpson,Woozle wozzle.
Audience Member,"Woozle wozzle? That's what passes for entertainment these days? ""Woozle wozzle?"""
Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, the clown show has been put on hiatus for retooling."
Bart Simpson,What happened?
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, don't worry about that. You're just finished, that's all."
Bart Simpson,Finished?
Krusty the Clown,It happens all the time. That's show business for ya. One day you're the most important guy who ever lived...
Krusty the Clown,The next day you're some schmo working in a box factory.
Box Executive,I heard that!
Bart Simpson,"Boy, show business is kinda cruel, isn't it?"
,
Bill,"And that was ""Kung Fu Fighting."" Say, speaking of one trick ponies, whatever happened to that ""I Didn't Do It"" kid?"
Marty,"Boy, did that get old fast. Whoa... ya know, if you want to last in this business, you gotta stay fresh."
,
Marge Simpson,"I saved these for you, Bart. You'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world's special little guy."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Mom."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh no, it is encrusted with filth."
Lisa Simpson,"And now you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase."
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
Marge Simpson,
Maggie Simpson,
Ned Flanders,Hidilly ho!
Barney Gumble,
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Lisa Simpson,If anyone wants me I'll be in my room.
Homer Simpson,What kind of catchphrase is that?
,
Customer #1,I need one twenty-nine cent stamp.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,That's a dollar eighty-five.
Customer #2,"I want two dollars worth of gas, please."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Four-twenty.
Martin Prince,How much is your penny candy?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Surprisingly expensive.
Martin Prince,What a rip-off.
Customer #1,This is what I think of your store.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Silly customer! You cannot hurt a Twinkie!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Jiminy cricket, whew, expired ham!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, this time I've gone too far. No, no one will fall for..."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Cheap meat!
Homer Simpson,"Oooh, this one's open!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... Not much time. Must finish."
,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, sir, Homer's illness was either caused by ingesting spoiled food or uh, some sort of voodoo curse."
Patty Bouvier,"Hey, we've just been workin' the eyes."
,
Homer Simpson,Your old meat made me sick!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I'm so sorry. Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.
Homer Simpson,This shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Okay, ten pounds."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
,
Kent Brockman,"Good evening. Here's an update on last week's nursing home expose: ""Geezers in Freezers."" It turns out the rest home was adequately heated, the footage you saw was of a fur storage facility. We've also been told to apologize for using the term ""Geezers."" Now coming up next, ""The Case of the Cantankerous Old Geezer."""
Homer Simpson,Ooh. Rancid meat attack. Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?
Kent Brockman,"If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number..."
Homer Simpson,Bor-ing.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart."
Kent Brockman,...and now a message from the Church of Latter Day Saints.
Dog,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, are you listening to me?"
Homer Simpson,"Shhhh, Lisa. The dog is barking."
,
Kent Brockman,"All right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?"
Homer Simpson,"No way, man No way, man. Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire."
Kent Brockman,"All right, all right, all right. Would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that I'll wear."
,
,
Kent Brockman,We've come up with a camera so tiny it fits into this oversized novelty hat.
Kent Brockman,"Now, go get us some incriminating footage. And remember, you have to get in and out in ten minutes, or you'll suffer permanent neck damage."
Technician,He's not kiddin'.
,
Homer Simpson,"Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet."
Homer Simpson,Bee? Aah!
,
Kent Brockman,"Homer, that hat's been with the station for twenty years. He had one day left 'til retirement."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"La, la, la, la, la."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, time to replenish the hot dog roller."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"La, la, l- Oop."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, well... let's sell it anyway."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Now this is just between me and you, smashed hat."
Kent Brockman,"Hot diggity dog! We've got him, Mr. Simpson. Now lets -- Mr. Simpson?"
Homer Simpson,One hot dog please.
,
,
Kent Brockman,"Apu, will you ever stop selling spoiled meat?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No! I mean, yes! I mean... uh-oh."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I think I come off very well.
Woman,"Monster! Run, children!"
Manager,"Apu Nahasapeemapetilan, you have disgraced the Kwik-E-Mart corporation."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"But sir, I was only following standard procedure."
Manager,"Ah, true. But it's also standard procedure to blame any problems on a scapegoat, or ""sacrificial lamb."""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Uh huh. And if I can obtain for you these animals...
Manager,"I'm sorry, Apu, I have no choice. You can no longer wear this name patch."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,
Manager,And you can no longer tell people about our fried pickles.
Manager,Now turn in your pricing gun.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Ooh.
Manager,The other one too.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Fired after all these years of loyal service. I don't want to live anymore!
Manager,Give me that wiener.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, I don't want to live, sir."
Manager,"Give me that wiener! No, Apu, it's not worth it!"
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,What do I do now? I've been drummed out of my profession. I am a disgrace.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Even this babbling brook sounds almost like mocking laughter.
Bum #1,Who needs money when we got feathers?
,
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,This is all because of Homer Simpson.
,
Comedian,"Yo, check this out. Black guys drive a car like this. Yeah, but white guys, see they drive a car like this."
Homer Simpson,"It's true, it's true. We're so lame."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,It is time to settle the score.
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware! I WAS UNAWAAARE!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village this is the traditional pose of apology."
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends. At first I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized it was I who wronged you. So I have come to work off my debt. I am at your service."
Homer Simpson,You're selling what now?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.
Homer Simpson,You can't sell that. Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,He's got me there.
,
Homer Simpson,Is he still out there?
Marge Simpson,"Yes, he's raking leaves."
Homer Simpson,What? That's your job. If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping...
Marge Simpson,"If he wants to make it up to you so badly, I think you should let him."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?"
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"It is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you. Back in Rhamatpur, I was considered quite the gourmet."
Marge Simpson,It certainly is exotic.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, is that too spicy for you?"
Lisa Simpson,I can see through time.
Homer Simpson,"Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a... Apu, what do you call this thing again?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,A napkin.
Homer Simpson,Outrageous.
,
Manager,"Alright, why do you want to become part of the Kwik-E-Mart family?"
Barney Gumble,"Because I like people, and I need a place where I'll be out of the sun."
Manager,"Hm, he's head and shoulders above everyone else."
Female Executive,Wait. There's one more applicant.
Manager,Name?
James Woods,James Woods.
Female Executive,Previous job experience?
James Woods,"Ooh, uh, ""True Believer,"" uh, ""Salvador,"" ""Onion Field,"" ""The Hard Way..."""
Manager,"Wait, wait a minute -- those aren't convenience stores. That sounds like the resume of a Hollywood movie star."
James Woods,Well.
Manager,James Woods!
Female Executive,Why would you want to work at a Kwik-E-Mart?
James Woods,"Well, to be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm gonna be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and you know, I, kinda like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, ""True Believer,"" I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then the film ""Chaplin,"" I had a little cameo in that, I actually traveled in time back to the 1920s where... I've, uh, said too much."
Manager,Welcome aboard.
,
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Good morning, sir!"
Homer Simpson,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Relax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before. What the...?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I like to keep a lollipop there."
,
Marge Simpson,"Apu, We usually store our cans in the cupboard."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, they'll never move that way."
Lisa Simpson,Mmm corn. Haven't had that in awhile.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, delicious corn."
Lisa Simpson,Bye!
Marge Simpson,"Hmm. Oh, we're low on milk for Maggie. You wanna come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Please, Mrs. Simpson. I... I can not go there. That is the scene of my spiritual depantsing."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess we could go to that new Monstromart..."
,
Marge Simpson,Ooh. That's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Great selection and rock bottom prices. But where is the love?
Announcer,Attention Monstromart shoppers. Just a reminder that we love each and every one of you.
Barney Gumble,"Excuse me, ma'am, where are the lampshades? Ma'am?"
Barney Gumble,"Oh, I've killed her. It's all happening again."
Stockboy,"Help me! Help m-- Mmm, it's crantastic!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, Mrs. Simpson, the Express Line is the fastest line - not always. That old man up front, he is starved for attention. He will talk the cashier's head off."
Grampa Simpson,"Ah, there's an interesting story behind this nickel. In 1957, I remember it was. I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of toast. I set the toaster to ""three,"" medium brown..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Let's go to that line.
Marge Simpson,But that's the longest.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, but look - all pathetic, single men - only cash, no chit-chat."
Marge Simpson,
,
James Woods,"Seventy-five, eighty-five, ninety and a dollar. Thank you and come again."
James Woods,"Hey! Wait a minute. Hey, can I just ask you a question?"
James Woods,"Did you, did you believe that?... I mean the way I gave you the change... Did I sound like a real Kwik-E-Mart, you know, kinda guy?"
Jimbo Jones,"Actually, I thought it was a little labored."
James Woods,Huh?
Jimbo Jones,"You gotta lose yourself in the moment, man."
James Woods,"Yeah, like... Yeah, okay, great. Okay, let's let's just try that again, okay? C'mon! Hey, c'mon. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Get over here. Okay. Now you're you I'm me."
Jimbo Jones,I'm me?
James Woods,"Hey, don't jerk me around, fella."
,
Homer Simpson,Pass the chutney.
Marge Simpson,"Apu, you've been so helpful. If it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the Monstromart."
Lisa Simpson,And he taught me how to play the shenai.
Homer Simpson,That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
Bart Simpson,And he taught me how to do this.
Bart Simpson,I got out of school because I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Thank you all for the kind praise.
Homer Simpson,Well you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
Homer Simpson,Ub. Apu friend me good.
Lisa Simpson,I think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I feel that way too. You see, whether igloo, hut, or lean-to/ or a geodesic dome / There's no structure I have been to / which I'd rather call my home..."
Grampa Simpson,Hello.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED YOU WERE ALL SUCH JERKS / BUT NOW I'VE COME TO LOOOVE YOUR QUIRKS/
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,MAGGIE WITH HER EYES SO BRIGHT / MARGE WITH HAIR BY FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT / LISA CAN PHILOSOPHIZE / BART'S ADEPT AT SPINNING LIES / HOMER'S A DELIGHTFUL FELLA / SORRY 'BOUT THE SALMONELLA.
Homer Simpson,That's okay.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART?/ NOW HERE'S THE TRICKY PART / OH WON'T YOU RHYME WITH ME? / WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART...
Marge Simpson,THEIR FLOORS ARE STICKY-MART.
Lisa Simpson,THEY MADE DAD SICKY-MART.
Bart Simpson,LET'S HURL A BRICKY-MART!
Homer Simpson,THAT KWIK-E-MART'S A REAL... .
All,WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,NOT ME!
All,FORGET THE KWIK-E-MART! / GOODBYE TO KWIK-E-MART! / WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,NOT ME!
Homer Simpson,Everything really wrapped up nicely. Much quicker than usual.
Marge Simpson,I guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
Homer Simpson,And we've all found happiness... Every one of us.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's that sound?"
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART? I DO.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song. I hate when people do that."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I can't lie to myself, you know... I do miss my Kwik-E-Mart."
Lisa Simpson,Isn't there anything you can do to get your job back?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I must go to the head office and appeal my case.
Homer Simpson,"I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do... Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing. But I'll go you one better and come along."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"But, sir, the head office is in India."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Lisa Simpson,Dad... That's over ten thousand miles away.
Homer Simpson,I'm aware of that.
Lisa Simpson,That's over sixteen thousand kilometers.
Homer Simpson,
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I'm sorry we couldn't take a cab, but I spent my last dollar on the plane tickets."
,
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,No.
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,No.
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,No.
Homer Simpson,Are we in India yet?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,No. Oh wait. Nnnnow we are.
,
James Woods,"To-Toni, Toni, do-- you're my agent, you have to do something about this. Uh, how can it be the same movie if they've changed my character from a tightly-wound convenience store clerk to a jittery Eskimo fire fighter? Uh-huh... uh-huh... um-hm... Well actually, that's a pretty good explanation. Now this gross, this'll be gross points, right, and there's no... okay, yeah, 'cause those mon... yeah, okay, great. Okay, good. Book me a flight, rent me an igloo, and tell those dorks at the Kwik-E-Mart that boom, I am outta here. I'm a dot. I'm gone, okay? Whaddaya mean I gotta give two weeks notice? Damn. Freakin'..."
James Woods,...no good motha... cheese. Not you... just talkin' to my oven.

Christians,"IF YOU'RE SAVED AND YOU KNOW IT, CLAP YOUR HANDS! / IF YOU'RE SAVED AND YOU KNOW IT CLAP YOUR HANDS! / IF YOU'RE SAVED AND YOU KNOW IT, AND..."
Robed Indian,Oh great. Christians.

Conductor,"Attention passengers, dinner is now being served in the dining car."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"There she is, there she is, the world's first convenience store."
Homer Simpson,This isn't very convenient.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Must you dump on everything we do?
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"He is the benevolent, enlightened president and CEO of Kwik-E-Mart, and in Ohio, Stop-O-Mart. He is the one I must ask for my job back."
Aged Man,"Approach, my sons."
Aged Man,You may ask me three questions.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"That's great, because all I need is one."
Homer Simpson,Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Aged Man,Yes.
Homer Simpson,Really?
Aged Man,Yes.
Homer Simpson,You?
Aged Man,Yes. I hope this has been enlightening for you.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"But, I must --"
Aged Man,"Thank you, come again."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,But...
Aged Man,"Thank you, come again."
Homer Simpson,Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Homer Simpson,"No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Apu, I accept your apology."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, Dad!"
Lisa Simpson,What'd ya bring? What'd ya bring?
Marge Simpson,How did it go?
Homer Simpson,"Fine. Oh, I mean not good."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry, Apu. But remember, Who needs a Kwik-E-Mart--"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Do you mind? I'm not in the mood.
Homer Simpson,"Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, yes you are right, sir. I've got to accept my fate. I have feared it for long enough now. I'm going to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart and I'm going to face my demon."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that'll work out great. We're out of Lucky Charms."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Ah, my old Squishee machine."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,And my scumbucket with fly.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,And the hot check list.
James Woods,"Hey! Hey, you're Apu Nahasapeemapetilan, aren't you? You're the... you're like the guy... You're a legend around here. Can I ask you, is it, is it true you once worked ninety-six hours straight?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, yes. It was horrible. I'll tell you. By the end I thought I was a hummingbird of some kind."
James Woods,"Oh, yeah. You know, I studied your old security tapes."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"In a few minutes, I try to drink nectar out of Sanjay's head."
ROBBER,"All right, you. Hand over the cash. And don't try any funny stuff."
James Woods,"Hey pal, I assure you if I tried any funny stuff, you would be in hysterics."
ROBBER,"Hey, you're James Woods."
James Woods,"Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you."
ROBBER,"Well, Mr. Woods, your new song is gonna be number three with a bullet."
James Woods,"Uh, I'm not a singer."
ROBBER,Shut up!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Noooooo!
James Woods,Apu!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Ah! The searing kiss of hot lead--how I missed you! I mean, I think I'm dying."
James Woods,Oi!
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, you are a very lucky man, Apu. You see, the bullet ricocheted off another bullet that was lodged in your chest from a previous robbery."
James Woods,"Apu, you saved my life. And as a small token of my appreciation, I got you your job back at the Kwik-E-Mart."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, oh, Mr. Woods, you're..."
James Woods,"As for me, I'm off to battle aliens on a faraway planet."
Marge Simpson,That sounds like a good movie.
James Woods,"Yes... yes, a movie, yes."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's all hug Apu."
Lisa Simpson,Awww.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again."
Lisa Simpson,Awww.

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Welcome to the new Springfield Center for Geriatric Medicine. You know, health care for the aging is an important priority--"
Grampa Simpson,Get to Matlock! Maaaatlock!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, uh, without further ado I give you the man who puts young people behind bars -- where they belong -- TV's ""Matlock!"""
Old Ladies,"WE LOVE YOU, MATLOCK, OH YES WE DO..."
,
Jasper Beardly,"What's eatin' you, Abe? For three weeks, all you been talkin' bout was meeting Matlock. Now you met him, swiped his pills... ""Take one every hour to prevent spastic heart convulsions..."""
Jasper Beardly,But you ain't said a word.
Grampa Simpson,Lookin' at that tired old freak has made me realize I'm no spring chicken myself. I can feel death's clammy hand on my shoulder.
Grampa Simpson,Wait. That's my hand.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Hello. As you may know, I might not be around much longer, so I've decided to give you your inheritance before I die, that way I can see you enjoy it. Lisa, I know you like reading and... so forth... To you I give you my lifetime of personal correspondence."
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks. ""Mr. Simpson. Stop. Your constant letters are becoming a nuisance. Stop. If you do not cease, I will be forced to pursue legal action. Stop. Signed, Boris Karloff, Hollywood, California."""
Grampa Simpson,"And to my son, Homer..."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Grampa Simpson,...And his entire family...
Homer Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,...I leave these. A box of mint-condition nineteen eighteen Liberty-Head silver dollars.
Grampa Simpson,"Ya see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in zeppelins dropping coins on people. And one day, I seen J.D. Rockefeller flyin' by, so I run out of the house with a big washtub and... Where're you goin'?"
Homer Simpson,"Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Anyway, about my washtub. I had just used it that morning to wash my turkey, which in those days was known as a ""Walking Bird""..."
Grampa Simpson,"...we'd always have ""Walking Bird"" on Thanksgiving. ... With all the trimmings: cranberries, Injun eyes, and yams stuffed with gunpowder. Then we'd all watch football, which in those days was called 'baseball.'"
,
Homer Simpson,"Look, Maggie! It's Sgt. Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, complete with Death-bringer missiles that really launch!"
Marge Simpson,That toy isn't safe for a baby like Maggie.
Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on, Marge, you're way too..."
Grampa Simpson,"When I was young, toys were built to last! Look at this junk! It breaks the first time you take it out of the box!"
Grampa Simpson,And look at these toy soldiers! They'll break the second I step on 'em! ...Stupid toy soldier... stupid!
Security Guard,"All right, come on, pops. Soldiers won't bother you anymore."
Homer Simpson,"ONE, TWO, THREE O'CLOCK, FOUR O'CLOCK ROCK. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN O'CLOCK, EIGHT O'CLOCK ROCK!.."
Homer Simpson,"ROCK! ROCK! ROCK! ROCK-A, ROCK, ROCK! ROCKAROCKROCK!"
Homer Simpson,"WE'RE GONNA ROCK, GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TO-NIGHHHTTT!"
Onlookers,Boo!
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, thank you very much!"
Lisa Simpson,"I'm warning you, Mom -- I may get a little crazy."
Marge Simpson,"I understand, honey. When I was your age there was a..."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, horse-face! Git yer ugly pie-hooks off that Summer Fun Set!"
Girl #1,"Look! ""Achy-Breaky"" Stacy for a dollar ninety-nine!"
Girl #2,Live from the Improv Stacy is only eighty- cents.
Girl #2,Ewww.
Girl,"Hey, mister, what's in the box?"
Girl #2,"Um, it's the uh new Talking Malibu Stacy."
Stockboy,Help!! Mr. Weiss!
,
Marge Simpson,Hm. I don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's what I bought it for!"
Grampa Simpson,Watch it with that thing! My skull is eggshell thin!
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks for buying us these toys, Grampa."
,
,
Grampa Simpson,"Bah. Why didn't you get something useful, like storm windows or a nice pipe organ? I'm thirsty! Ew! What smells like mustard? There sure are a lotta ugly people in your neighborhood. Oh, look at that one!"
Grampa Simpson,Ow! My glaucoma just got worse! The president is a demmycrat! Hello! I can't unbuckle my seat belt! Hello?
,
Grampa Simpson,There are too many leaves in your walkway!
Grampa Simpson,Why are you people avoiding me? Does my withered face remind you of the grim specter of death?
Homer Simpson,Yes. But there's more.
Homer Simpson,"Dad, I love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya."
Grampa Simpson,Consarn it! I guess I am an old crank. But what am I gonna do about it?
Hip Old Man,One sip and I'm totally hip!
Buzz Announcer,Buzz Cola. There's a little boogie in every bottle.
Grampa Simpson,"Holy smokes, that's it! From now on, I'm thinkin', actin', and lookin' young! And I'm gonna start with a bottle of Buzz Cola!"
Grampa Simpson,"Ow! The bubbles are burning my tongue! Ow! Eh! Water, water!"
Lisa Simpson,A hush falls over the General Assembly as Stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address.
Malibu Stacy,I wish they taught shopping in school!
Malibu Stacy,Let's bake some cookies for the boys!
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Stacy. I've waited my whole life to hear you speak. Don't you have anything relevant to say?"
Malibu Stacy,Don't ask me -- I'm just a girl!
Bart Simpson,"Right on! Say it, sister!"
Lisa Simpson,"It's not funny, Bart! Millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! That they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!"
Bart Simpson,Just what I was gonna say.
,
Grampa Simpson,Look at me! I'm actin' young! Woooow!
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, this ain't so bad."
Malibu Stacy,Let's buy makeup so the boys will like us!
Lisa Simpson,Don't you people see anything wrong with what Malibu Stacy says?
Goofy Girl,"Oh, there's something wrong with what my Stacy says."
Goofy Girl's Stacy,My Spidey sense is tingling! Anybody call for a web-slinger?
Lisa Simpson,"No, Celeste, I mean the things she says are sexist."
Becky,Oooh! Lisa said a dirty word!
,
Lisa Simpson,They cannot keep making dolls like this! Something has to be done!
Marge Simpson,"Lisa -- ordinarily, I'd say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you made us march in that Gay Rights Parade."
Homer Simpson,And we can't watch Fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in Syria.
Lisa Simpson,"I can't believe you're just gonna stand by as your daughters grow up in a world where this, this is their role model."
Marge Simpson,"I had a Malibu Stacy when I was little, and I turned out all right. Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream."
Malibu Stacy,Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream!
Marge Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,That's it! I'm calling the company!
,
Recorded Voice,"Hello. You have reached the Malibu Stacy Customer Service Center. If you have a complaint about Malibu Stacy's appearance or odor, press one. If you've given Malibu Stacy a haircut and need to order a replacement head, press two. For information on our factory tour, press three..."
Lisa Simpson,Mom! We could go on the factory tour and I could complain in person!
Marge Simpson,"Honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are you? The Keebler people were very upset..."
,
,
Claire Harper,"Welcome to Enchantment Lane, where all the parts come together and Malibu Stacy is born! Some folks say there is a little touch of fairy dust in the air."
,
Ugly Man,"Aw, crap. There's a clog in the torso chute! Leroy, get your ass in gear."
Leroy,Shut yer hole.
Announcer,Malibu Stacy -- America's favorite eight and a half incher!
Announcer,"In 1959, homemaker Stacy Lovell had a design and a dream. The design--Malibu Stacy. The dream--to mass-market a fashion doll that was also edible."
Announcer,"Kids didn't much like the taste of dried onion meal, but they loved the doll! A second, plastic Malibu Stacy took America by storm. Just ask the owner of the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection--Waylon Smithers of Springfield."
Waylon Smithers,"Hello, Malibu Stacy collectors! I'll see you at StacyCon ninety-four, at the San Diego Airport Hilton!"
Announcer,And what does Stacy think of her thirty-five years of success and millions of friends worldwide?
Malibu Stacy,"Don't ask me, I'm just a girl!"
Announcer,She sure is!
Claire Harper,"Well, that's the tour. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer--"
Lisa Simpson,I have one.
Claire Harper,Yes?
Lisa Simpson,"Is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by Malibu Stacy intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?"
Claire Harper,"Believe me, we're very mindful of such concerns."
Executive,"Hey, Jiggles! Grab a pad and back that gorgeous butt in here!"
Claire Harper,"Oh, you, get away..."
Executive,"Ah, don't act like you don't like it."
,
Lisa Simpson,It's awful being a kid. No one listens to you.
Grampa Simpson,It's rotten being old. No one listens to ya.
Homer Simpson,"I'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. Everyone listens to me! No matter how dumb my suggestions are."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
Grampa Simpson,--And gripin'. It's time for --
Lisa Simpson,Action! I've got to talk to that woman who invented Malibu Stacy and see if I can get her to --
Grampa Simpson,-- Come out of retirement! I'm gonna get me a job! A real Malibu! ...And see if Stacy can help invent me... young... Help!!
Lisa Simpson,You're getting a job.
Grampa Simpson,Yes! I'm goin' where the action is!
,
Grampa Simpson,Come in! Come in! Mayday! I'm losing your transmission!
Angry Customer,I said french fries!!
Grampa Simpson,"What the...? Do we sell ""french fries?"""
,
Waylon Smithers,"Yes? Why, it's Homer Simpson's daughter."
Lisa Simpson,I thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of Malibu Stacy.
Waylon Smithers,"Whew! That would be quite a feat. Stacy Lovell's a total recluse -- she hasn't appeared in public in twenty years. Here, I'm writing an article on her for my next Malibu Stacy Newsletter. It contains her last known whereabouts. I'll - uh -print you out a copy."
Lisa Simpson,Thanks.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, Smithers. You're quite good at turning me on."
Waylon Smithers,"Um, you probably should ignore that."
,
Lisa Simpson,"No, it couldn't be..."
Lisa Simpson,Excuse me. Miss Lovell? I'd like to talk to you about Malibu Stacy.
Old Woman,Do you have any idea how many kids have tried to track me down and--
Lisa Simpson,Am I the first?
Old Woman,Yes.
Lisa Simpson,I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
Malibu Stacy,Thinking too much gives you wrinkles.
Young Man,All right! I've been waitin' nine years to get my Frisbee back!
Man,Ohhhhh...
,
Malibu Stacy,"My name is Stacy, but you can call me ."
Stacy Lovell,I see exactly what you mean. This is a problem. But what do you expect me to do?
Lisa Simpson,Change what she says. It's your company.
Stacy Lovell,Not since I was forced out in nineteen seventy-four. They said my way of thinking just wasn't cost effective.
Lisa Simpson,That's awful!
Stacy Lovell,"Well, that, and I was funneling profits to the Vietcong."
Lisa Simpson,"But you are Malibu Stacy, and as long as she has your name, you have a responsibility. I'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the Simpson name on it."
Stacy Lovell,"I may have had things in common with Stacy in the beginning, but thirty years of living her lifestyle taught me some very harsh lessons. Five husbands..."
Stacy Lovell,"Ken, Johnny, Joe, Dr. Colossus, Steve Austin..."
Lisa Simpson,"But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's mistakes, so can everyone. I'm sure we can think of something together. C'mon!"
Stacy Lovell,"Not now, I'm too drunk."
Lisa Simpson,"No you're not! Uh, I'll come back tomorrow."
,
Manager,We need some more secret sauce. Put this mayonnaise in the sun.
Grampa Simpson,"Hey! Now that old man Peterson's off our backs, let's have some fun!"
Grampa Simpson,Ever see a sandwich that could take a bite out of you? Look at this sandwich. It's gonna bite you.
Man,Ow!! Damn sandwich took a bite outta me!
Grampa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"I've got the solution -- you and I are gonna make our own talking doll. She'll have the wisdom of Gertrude Stein and the wit of Cathy Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina Totenberg and the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. And to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt!"
Stacy Lovell,"All right, we'll make your doll!"
GI JOE,"Stacy, please, I must have you back. Just come for a ride with me in my mobile command unit."
Stacy Lovell,"Joe, I told you. It's over. Release me from your kung fu grip."
GI JOE,"Fine. I'll bomb your house into the ground, missy."
Lisa Simpson,Make sure you get my Mom's hair just right.
Stacy Lovell,"Um, I think we'll use someone different for the hair."
Lisa Simpson,How about me?
Stacy Lovell,"Um, there's something not quite..."
Bart Simpson,How about me?
Stacy Lovell,
Homer Simpson,How about me?
Dr. Babcock,Excuse me?
Stacy Lovell,You all have hideous hair!
Lisa Simpson,
Stacy Lovell,I mean from a design point of view.
Lisa Simpson,
Technician,"Talking doll, take eight."
Lisa Simpson,"""...When I get married, I'm keeping my own name."" You know, that should probably be if I choose to get married."
Technician,"Uh, look, little girl, we got other talking dollies to record today."
Krusty the Clown,"Alright you poindexters, let's get this right. OneHeyheykidsI'mTalkingKrusty! TwoHeyheyherecomesSlideshowMel- again- herecomesSideshowMel, SideshowMel. Three: ! Baddabing, baddaboom, I'm done. Learn from the professional, kid."
Technician,"Okay, Krusty, uh we are ready to roll and uh... What the --"
Doll,Trust in yourself and you can achieve anything.
Lisa Simpson,All right! Now all we need is a name.
Bart Simpson,"How about ""Blabbermouth -- The Jerky Doll for Jerks?"""
Lisa Simpson,"How about ""Minerva,"" after the Roman goddess of wisdom?"
Stacy Lovell,"Hmm, not enough commercial appeal."
Bart Simpson,"Wendy Windbag? ""Ugly Doris""? ""Hortense: The Mule-faced Doll""?"
Stacy Lovell,"I think we should name her after Lisa. We'll call her ""Lisa Lionheart."""
Bart Simpson,"No! ""Loudmouth Lisa!"""
Bart Simpson,Stupid Lisa Garbageface! I can't stand this any longer! Somebody please pay attention to me!
Bart Simpson,Hello! Pay attention to me! Look at me! I'm Bart! I'm Bart! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
,
Lisa Simpson,This is great! They're really gonna sell our doll.
Stacy Lovell,"Well, it wasn't difficult. I just told them who I was, and who you were, and they couldn't resist."
Lisa Simpson,Really?
Stacy Lovell,"Well, I didn't tell them who you were."
,
Grim C.E.O.,"Gentlemen, we've got to sink this Lisa Lionheart doll and fast. It's time to call in a favor from Washington."
,
,
Senator,Yes... Yes... I understand... I'll take care of it personally.
,
Senator,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, did you hear something?"
Homer Simpson,I'unno.
,
Brockman's Daughter,"Dad, my new doll's much better than Malibu Stacy. Do a newscast about her!"
Kent Brockman,"Please, honey, Daddy's job is to bring people important news. Right now I'm very busy preparing a report about the fortieth anniversary of Beetle Bailey."
Brockman's Daughter,"Oh, Daddy, that is boring! Talk about the dolly!"
Kent Brockman,Well... You were right about the Berlin Wall.
,
Kent Brockman,"Though it was unusual to spend twenty-eight minutes reporting on a doll, this reporter found it impossible to stop talking. It's just really fascinating news, folks. Goodnight."
Kent Brockman,"Oh, and the President was arrested for murder. More on that tomorrow night... or you can turn to another channel."
Kent Brockman,Oh. Do not turn to another channel.
,
Grim C.E.O.,"Our one effort to put a stop to this Lisa Lionheart thing has failed miserably. Gentlemen, we have to reinvent Malibu Stacy for the nineties."
Grim C.E.O.,We'll stay here all night if need be.
Executive #2,Can we order Chinese food?
Grim C.E.O.,Yes.
Executives,
,
Jasper Beardly,I cut my tongue on these pancakes.
Old Lady Customer,These eggs are difficult to digest. I want soft-boiled eggs.
Grampa Simpson,"I told you we don't have soft boiled eggs. If you -- ...By gum you're right, we should have 'em. I shouldn't be listening to complaints, I should be makin' 'em with you guys. The good Lord lets us grow old for a reason: to gain the wisdom to find fault with everything he's made!"
Grampa Simpson,"Mr. Peterson, you can take this job and... fill it. And one more thing. I never once washed my hands - that's your policy, not mine."
Old People,"""You tell 'em, Abe."""
Old People,"Oh, my back."
Waylon Smithers,I wannit! I wannit! I wannit! I wannit! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I wannit! I wannit! I wannit!
Girl #1,Look! It's Lisa Lionheart!
GIRL#2,Keep running! We're almost there!
Girl #1,They changed Malibu Stacy!
Girl #2,She is better than ever!
Lisa Simpson,Wait! Don't be fooled! She's just a regular Malibu Stacy with a stupid cheap hat! She still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before.
Waylon Smithers,But she's got a new hat.
Girls,I wannit! I wannit! etc.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I guess you can't beat big business. There's just no room for the little guy."
Doll,Trust in yourself and you can achieve anything.
Lisa Simpson,"You know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll all be worth it."
Stacy Lovell,"Yes. Particularly if that little girl happens to pay $46,000 for that doll."
Lisa Simpson,What?
Stacy Lovell,"Oh, nothing. Kudos to you, Lisa! Kudos!"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Lisa, Lady -- If you'll excuse me, I've got something very important to attend to."
,
Waylon Smithers,Attention! All workers trudge immediately to the main yard for the mandatory Worker of the Week award festivities.
Guard #1,"Clean, clean, pistol, uzi, two kids posing as an adult..."
Guard #1,"Hey, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Hey.
Carl Carlson,I hate these Worker of the Week award ceremonies.
Lenny Leonard,Who even cares anymore? Everyone that works here has already got one.
Carl Carlson,Except forrrrr...
Homer Simpson,"Hello. Well, today's the day for Homer J. I know I'm gonna win this time."
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, how come?"
Homer Simpson,"Union rule twenty-six - ""Every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."""
Waylon Smithers,"Attention, everyone. Let's have an awed hush please for Mr. Burns."
Race,They'll clog the instruments!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Compadres, it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters before the start of the rainy season. And remember, a shiny new donkey for whoever brings me the head of Colonel Montoya."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Huh? What? And by that I mean, of course, it's time for the Worker of the Week Award. I can't believe we've overlooked this week's winner for so very very long. We simply could not function without his tireless efforts. So, a round of applause for... this inanimate carbon rod."
Crowd Noise,
Homer Simpson,Inanimate huh? I'll show him inanimate!
,
Homer Simpson,Stupid carbon rod. It's all just a popularity contest.
Bart Simpson,Wow! Did you actually get to see the rod?
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Homie."
Homer Simpson,Nobody respects me at work.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we respect you."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I told you, don't draw on your father's skull."
Homer Simpson,"What, what does it say? I want to see."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ah, TV respects me. It laughs with me, not at me."
Man,Stupid...
Homer Simpson,
Nasa Announcer #1,"It's a lovely day for a launch here live at Cape Canaveral at the lower end of the Florida peninsula. And the purpose of today's mission is truly, really electrifying."
Nasa Announcer #2,"That's correct, Tom. The lion share of this flight will be devoted to the study of the effects of weightlessness on tiny screws."
Nasa Announcer #1,Unbelievable! And just imagine the logistics of weightlessness. And of course this could have literally millions of applications here on Earth... in everything from watch making to watch repair.
Homer Simpson,Boring.
Homer Simpson,"No, the batteries!"
Nasa Announcer #1,Now let's look at the crew a little.
,
Nasa Announcer #1,"And we laugh legitimately. There's a mathematician, a different kind of mathematician and a statistician."
Homer Simpson,Make it stop!
Bart Simpson,"Oh no, not another boring space launch! Change the channel! Change the channel!"
Homer Simpson,I can't! I can't!
Bart Simpson,
,
Dr. Babcock,"Sir, we've run into a serious problem with the mission. These Nielsen ratings are the lowest ever."
STILLWATER,"Oh my God! We've been beaten by ""A Connie Chung Christmas."""
,
STILLWATER,"People, we're in danger of losing our funding. America isn't interested in space exploration anymore."
Dr. Babcock,"Maybe we should finally tell them the big secret, that all the chimps we sent into space came back super intelligent."
,
STILLWATER,We need a fresh angle to get the public interested.
Dr. Babcock,"The public see our astronauts as clean-cut, athletic go-getters. They hate people like that."
Female Scientist,Well who do they like?
Dr. Babcock,"Well, here are the most popular personalities on televison or TV."
TIM ALLEN-TYPE,I did it! I supercharged my riding mower.
TIM ALLEN-TYPE,Oh no! I've killed Wilson. Looks like it's back to jail for me.
Peg,"Al, let's have sex."
Al,"Uh, no Peg."
Nerdy Scientist,"Why, they're all a bunch of blue collar slobs."
STILLWATER,"People, that's who we need for our next astronaut."
Dr. Babcock,"I suggest a lengthy, inefficient search, at the tax payers expense, of course."
STILLWATER,"God, I wish there was an easier way."
Homer Simpson,"Hello, is this NASA?"
STILLWATER,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Good. Listen, I'm sick of your boring space launches. Now I'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but I know what I likes on TV..."
STILLWATER,How did you get this number?
Homer Simpson,Shut up. And another thing - how come I can't get no Tang 'round here? And also... hold on a second.
STILLWATER,"People, our long search is over."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, is this President Clinton? Good. I figured if anyone knew where to get some Tang it'd be you... shut up!"
Dr. Babcock,Are you the person that called NASA yesterday?
Homer Simpson,"No. It wasn't me, I swear. It was... him."
STILLWATER,"Sir, how would you like to get higher than you've ever been in your life?"
Barney Gumble,Be an astronaut? Sure.
STILLWATER,"Well, welcome aboard. I think you'll find that this will win you the respect of your family and friends."
Homer Simpson,"Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE."
STILLWATER,"Eh, better take both of them."
STILLWATER,I don't really think that was necessary. They wanted to be astronauts.
Dr. Babcock,I know.
,
,
STILLWATER,"Ladies and gentlemen and members of the press, I'd like to present the new generation of NASA astronaut, the average American."
Jim Wallace,"Jim Wallace, Associated Press. Is this a joke?"
STILLWATER,"Far from it, Jim. One of these men will prove space travel is within the reach of the common man."
Toby Hunter,"Toby Hunter, Minneapolis Star. No, really. Is this a joke?"
STILLWATER,No Toby. And no more questions about whether this is a joke.
Reporter #1,Uh... question for the barbecue chef: don't you think there is an inherent danger in sending under-qualified civilians into space?
Homer Simpson,"I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible Planet of the Apes. ...Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty... That was our planet. You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to hell."
STILLWATER,"Thank you, I'm afraid that's all we have time for."
,
STILLWATER,"Now of course only one of you will be chosen to go into space, so the next few weeks will be a grueling series of tests to determine which one of you is most qualified."
Dr. Babcock,"Oh, and Mr. Gumbel - for the duration of the training, there'll be no more beer."
Barney Gumble,What? Three whole weeks with only wine? I'll go crazy?
BUZZ,"Careful, they're ruffled!"
Homer Simpson,I'll take care of this.
Homer Simpson,And may the best man win. He's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. Meet me up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.
,
Bart Simpson,"Wow! My father, an astronaut! I feel so full of... what's the opposite of shame?"
Marge Simpson,Pride?
Bart Simpson,"No, not that far from shame."
Homer Simpson,Less shame?
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Marge Simpson,"You know, Homer, when I found out about this I went through a wide range of emotions. First I was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. But now I realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do."
Homer Simpson,Who's doin' what now?
,
Homer Simpson,"Well here I am, right on time. I don't see Barney ""Let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-White-House-and-kill-the-President"" Gumbel."
Dr. Babcock,Actually he's been here since sunrise.
Barney Gumble,"Hi Homer, since they made me stop drinking, I've regained my balance and diction. Observe."
Barney Gumble,"I AM THE VERY MODEL OF A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL / I'VE INFORMATION VEGETABLE, ANIMAL, AND MINERAL."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's nothin'. Watch this. There once was a man from Nantucket"
Homer Simpson,I can't stands no more.
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm. Mediciney.
Dr. Babcock,I wager 400 quatloos on the newcomer.
,
STILLWATER,"Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet the two experienced astronauts who will accompany the winner into space. Race Banyon and Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon."
BUZZ,Second comes right after first.
BUZZ,"So Barney, we hear you're kickin' ass."
Homer Simpson,"Ahem... I uh... don't think this contest is over yet, Buzz. If that is your real name. I believe there Is still a little something called the swimsuit competition."
STILLWATER,"There's no swimsuit competition, Homer."
Homer Simpson,You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
STILLWATER,"Gentlemen, you've both worked very hard, and in a way you're both winners. But in another more accurate way, Barney is the winner."
Homer Simpson,"Congratulations, Barney."
STILLWATER,"That's very gracious of you, Homer. Please join us in a toast."
Dr. Babcock,To the mission.
Barney Gumble,It begins.
Barney Gumble,"Gimme that! / Stop it, Barney no! / No! / Please! / For God sake! / Stop!"
Barney Gumble,Ta da da dum da do!
,
Barney Gumble,
,
Dr. Babcock,I don't understand it. That was non-alcoholic champagne.
STILLWATER,"Well, Homer. I guess you're the winner by default."
Homer Simpson,Default? Woo hoo! The two sweetest words in the English language. De-fault! De-fault! De-
STILLWATER,"Where'd you get that, anyway?"
Dr. Babcock,Sent away.
,
,
,
Announcer,The preceding program contained scenes of extreme violence and should not have been viewed by young children.
,
,
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I don't really want to go through with this... But being an astronaut is how I got you to respect me."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, when I met you, you weren't an astronaut. You didn't even know how to use a Touchtone. But I still respected you, and I always will, no matter what."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you already dialed."
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Marge Simpson,"But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life."
Homer Simpson,Ants!
Ants,
Ant #1,SUBTITLE: PROTECT THE QUEEN!
Ant #2,SUBTITLE: WHICH ONE'S THE QUEEN?
Ant #3,SUBTITLE: I'M THE QUEEN.
Ant #4,SUBTITLE: NO YOU'RE NOT.
Ants,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge. Just like the time I could've met Mr. T at the mall. The entire day, I kept saying, I'll go a little later, I'll go a little later.' And then when I got there, they told me he just left. And when I asked the mall guy if he would ever come back again, he said he didn't know. Well, I'm never gonna let something like that happen again. I'm going into space, right now."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I am so proud of you. And I know it's going to go just fine..."
,
Mission Control,T-minus three minutes 'til lift off and counting.
,
BUZZ,"Mission control, this is Corvair, launch sequence initiated. All systems go."
Homer Simpson,Are we there yet? I'm thirsty.
Race,"Mission Control, request permission to sedate cargo ahead of schedule."
Mission Control,Permission denied.
Race,Payload checklist. IRS surveillance satellite.
BUZZ,Check!
Race,Ant farm.
BUZZ,Check!
Race,Children's letters to God.
BUZZ,Check!
,
Mission Control,"Three, two, one, make rocket go now."
,
Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"Go, Dad! Go!"
Lisa Simpson,"How doth the hero, strong and brave, a celestial path in the heavens pave!"
Lisa Simpson,"Go, Dad, go."
,
Dr. Babcock,"Sir, the TV ratings for the launch are the highest in ten years."
Everybody,
STILLWATER,And how's the spacecraft doing?
Dr. Babcock,I don't know. All this equipment is just used to measure TV ratings.
,
Homer Simpson,It's beautiful. It's the most awe inspiring sight I have ever seen.
,
Homer Simpson,"... giver of life, mother of us all."
Homer Simpson,"Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard."
BUZZ,"Homer, no!"
BUZZ,"You fool, now we may never know if ants can be trained to sort tiny screws in space."
Mission Control,"Some good news, gentlemen, we have quite a treat for ya. We've been able to coax superstar James Taylor in here at mission control to wish you well and play a little of his own brand of laid back adult contemporary music."
Homer Simpson,Wow! Former president James Taylor.
James Taylor,"How ya doin', fellas?"
BUZZ,"With all due respect, Mr. Taylor, this isn't the best time for your unique brand of bittersweet folk rock. We have a potentially critical situation here. I'm sure you'll understand."
James Taylor,"Listen, Aldrin, I'm not as laid back as people think. Now here's the deal: I'm gonna play and you're gonna float there and like it."
James Taylor,"WHEN YOU'RE DOWN AND TROUBLED AND YOU NEED A HELPING HAND.../ AND NOTHING, OH NOTHING IS GOING RIGHT..."
,
Kent Brockman,"We're just about to get our first pictures from inside the spacecraft with ""Average-naut"" Homer Simpson. And we'd like to..."
,
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, kids, I'm sure your father's all right."
Lisa Simpson,"What are you basing that on, Mom?"
Marge Simpson,Who wants ginger snaps?
,
,
Race,Oh my God! The ants are shorting out our navigation system!
,
James Taylor,"Ants, huh? We had quite a severe ant problem at the Vineyard this year. I had Art Garfunkel come by with his compressor and we created a total vacuum outside the house and we blew the ants out the front door. But I'm sure you high-tech NASA people could care less about our resort town ways."
Dr. Babcock,"Quiet, you."
STILLWATER,"Wait a minute, this unkempt youngster just might be on to something."
,
Race,"Okay, everybody grab on to something."
BUZZ,"All right, here we go: three, two, one, make hatch blow...now!"
Homer Simpson,And that is that.
Homer Simpson,No!
,
STILLWATER,Oh my God! This is a disaster.
James Taylor,Gotta go!
,
BUZZ,"Homer, you broke the handle."
Race,"With that hatch open, we'll burn up on reentry. That's it! If I go, I'm taking you to hell with me."
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute Race! Wait a minute. Wait!...Ah-ha! Now I'll bust that pretty face of yours.
Homer Simpson,Stupid bar.
BUZZ,"Wait, Homer. If that bar holds, we just might make it back to earth."
Homer Simpson,I'll bash you good.
Kent Brockman,"Well, this reporter was possibly a little hasty earlier and would like to reaffirm his allegiance to this country and its human president. It may not be perfect, but it's still the best government we have. For now. Hmm? Oh, yeAH..."
Kent Brockman,"By the way, the spacecraft is still in extreme danger. May not make it back. Attempting risky reentry... Blah blah blah blah blah. We'll see you after the movie."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ CRISPY CRUNCHY GRAHAM CEREAL BRAND NEW BREAKFAST TREAT."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Dad, you can make it."
Grampa Simpson,Of course he'll make it. It's TV.
,
,
,
Reporter,How'd you solve the door dilemma?
BUZZ,Homer Simpson was the real hero here. He jury-rigged the door closed using this.
Reporter,"Hey, what is that?"
RERPORTER #4,It's an inanimate carbon rod.
Bart Simpson,"Aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod."
Homer Simpson,Stupid rod. I got gypped.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, you should be proud. Only a handful of people have done what you've done."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Dad. How many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, maybe I do have the right... what's that stuff? Anyway, thanks, Marge, Lisa."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, do you have something nice to say to your father?"
Bart Simpson,"Eh, he knows how I feel."
Star Child Homer,
Kent Brockman,"Tonight on ""Eye on Springfield"": just miles from your doorstep, hundreds of men are given weapons and trained to kill. The government calls it the Army. But a more alarmist name would be... the Kill-bot Factory."
Kent Brockman,"But first, Springfield has come down with a fever. Football fever, brought on by the biggest game of the year, the Pigskin Classic between the Shelbyville Sharks and our own Springfield Atoms."
Kent Brockman,If you have the fever there's only one cure. Take two tickets and see the game Sunday morning.
Announcer,Warning: Tickets should not be taken internally.
,
Homer Simpson,"See because of me, now they have a warning."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad... sell you these for fifty bucks."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Sold!
Marge Simpson,"Those aren't tickets to the game, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig."
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Homey. Heh, heh, heh. I don't need her at all anymore."
,
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh-heh, I did it. Second in line and all I had to do was miss eight days of work."
Chicken,"Personally, I think I'm overdone."
Just Stamp the Ticket Man,"With the money you would have made working, you could've bought tickets from a scalper."
Homer Simpson,"In theory, yes. Jerk."
First Guy In Line,"Give me uh, thirty-thousand tickets."
Ticket Seller,"That'll be nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars, please."
First Guy In Line,"Look, the thing about that is, I only got ten dollars on me. Can I pay you the rest later?"
Ticket Seller,Sure.
,
Bill,"That was Bobby McFerrin's new one, ""I'm Worried, Need Money!"" Okay, if you want two tickets to the big Pigskin Classic just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller!"
Homer Simpson,Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!
Homer Simpson,Oh stupid sheep.
Homer Simpson,
,
Bill,Still waiting for that caller.
Marty,"Oh, we have a winner! What's your name, sir?"
Ned Flanders,Ned Flanders...
Homer Simpson,"Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders."
Ned Flanders,"Oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. Oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so I can report it on my income tax?"
Eddie Money,I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / WON'T YOU PACK YOUR BAGS TO LEAVE TONIGHT /
Homer Simpson,I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE / I'VE GOT TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE...
Homer Simpson,Excellent guitar riff.
,
Homer Simpson,Why am I such a loser? Why?
,
Lisa Simpson,What's so special about this game anyway? It's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and Shelbyville. They built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. They made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, the walls are melting again."
Homer Simpson,"God, if you really are God, you'll get me tickets to that game."
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, neighbor. Wanna go to the game with me? I got two tic..."
Homer Simpson,"Why do you mock me, oh Lord?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's not God, that's just a waffle that Bart tossed up there."
Homer Simpson,I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm... sacri-licious.
,
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Marge Simpson,Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
Homer Simpson,Y- No.
Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game with you."
Ned Flanders,"Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, yeah."
,
Homer Simpson,Duck! I can't let the boys see me with you!
Ned Flanders,What?
Homer Simpson,Hi.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey look, Homer's got one of those robot cars."
Carl Carlson,One of those American robot cars.
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Men, there's a little crippled boy sitting in the hospital who wants you to win this game. I know because I crippled him myself to inspire you."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well I hope they win, or Mr. Burns said he's coming back."
,
Ned Flanders,"Wow, these are amazing seats, huh Homer?"
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,"Hey everybody, here comes fun!"
Homer Simpson,Heh heh. Ow.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"I'll take two dogs, two sodas and uh two ice cream bars."
Mayor Joe Quimby,What the hell happened to my dogs? I want answers.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I should pay my share..."
Ned Flanders,"Relax, Homer, I keep tellin' ya, you're my guest."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. Thanks, Ned."
Homer Simpson,"NACHO, NACHO MAN / I WANT TO BE A NACHO MAN."
Homer Simpson,"If anyone can pull it off, it's Stan ""The Boy"" Taylor."
Crowd,"Stan, Stan, he's our boy, if he can't do it, no one ...will."
Homer Simpson,"We won! We won! Flanders, we won!"
Ned Flanders,"Heh-heh, yeah."
Homer Simpson,"Losers! Losers! Kiss my big Springfield behind, Shelbyville!"
Homer Simpson,I am invincible! Invincible!
Homer Simpson,Ow!
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, somebody sign an autograph. Please, somebody!? Sign an autograph. Hey, would you sign... You fat, stupid jerks!"
Homer Simpson,It was him!
Stan,Ned? Is that...? Ned Flanders?
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, Stanster."
Homer Simpson,You know Stan Taylor?
Stan,"Know me? Ned Flanders saved me. I used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models, until Ned and his Bible group showed me that I could have more."
Homer Simpson,Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.
Stan,"Ned, they gave me the game ball. I want you to have it."
Ned Flanders,"Stan, tell you what -- Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth. I bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
Stan,Sure. Anything for Neddie. Here you go.
Homer Simpson,"Wow, thanks. Now I have four children. You will be called ""Stitch-face."" Wow, Flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me."
,
Ned Flanders,"Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again."
Homer Simpson,No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend!
Lenny Leonard,What'd he say?
Carl Carlson,I dunno. Somethin' about being gay.
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's our wedding photo."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, quit livin' in the past."
Marge Simpson,
,
Ned Flanders,"Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
Homer Simpson,I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad and Ned Flanders friends? What's next... ""A's"" on Bart's report card?"
Bart Simpson,Hey.
,
Ned Flanders,"Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table."
Homer Simpson,"Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese."
Homer Simpson,Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.
Father,"What's wrong, Jeremiah?"
Jeremiah,It's not fair. My brother Joseph has a sin to confess. I wish I had one too.
Father,Oh don't you see? You do have a sin to confess - the sin of envy.
Todd Flanders,"That's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?"
Homer Simpson,Boring. Let's watch something else.
Todd Flanders,Aw.
Ned Flanders,"Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch."
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,Hey what gives? I thought you had a satellite dish.
Ned Flanders,Sure didilly do. Over two hundred and thirty channels locked out.
Maude Flanders,"Okay, boys, time for bed. Say good night."
Todd Flanders,"Good night, Daddy. Good night, Uncle Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Uncle Homer. Ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, I want you to get to know my family."
,
Homer Simpson,Hey everyone!
Barflies,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I don't want no people in here with their evils of alcohol rap."
Ned Flanders,Wait a second. You're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children.
,
Moe Szyslak,... And truly she was my friend Flicka.
Moe Szyslak,"If this gets out, the next words you say will be muffled by your own butt."
,
Marge Simpson,"Honey, I'm so glad you're home--"
Homer Simpson,Can't talk... see Flanders... later sex.
Marge Simpson,
,
Ned Flanders,"...Bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house."
Homer Simpson,"Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I-I'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night I do my charity work."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. A judge made me do that once, too. Stupid lack of public urinals. Hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, I'm comin' with ya."
Ned Flanders,Oh... well... that sounds super duper.
,
Priest,"Oh, you poor, unfortunate man. Let's get you out of those clothes immediately. And we'll do whatever we can about the smell."
Homer Simpson,But... all right.
Homer Simpson,C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
Ned Flanders,"Homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at Moe's tonight."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, for some reason, Moe's is always closed on Wednesdays."
Moe Szyslak,"...And then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women."
Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that."
Reporter,Wow! Look at that enthusiasm! This is front page material!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homey, I'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with Ned? Your family needs you too."
Homer Simpson,"Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
Marge Simpson,That was you!
Homer Simpson,"Love, Marge. Don't hate. Love."
Bart Simpson,"The Flanders are a buncha geeks, man."
Ned Flanders,"Sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
Homer Simpson,"The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But we've got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend."
Bart Simpson,"No way, JosÃ© !"
Homer Simpson,Yes way.
Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure."
Bart Simpson,Ay caramba!
Lisa Simpson,That's the spirit.
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I brought my Rappin' Ronnie Reagan tape. It always makes the trip go faster."
Rappin' Ronnie,WELL\WELL\WELL...W-W-W-WELL\WELL\WELL...
Homer Simpson,"Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot."
Rappin' Ronnie,WELL\WELL\WELL\ W-W-W-\WELL\ WELL\WELL\WELL\WELL\WELL
,
,
Homer Simpson,"More. No, no, keep comin'. More... more... right there! Let her go!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's go boating!"
,
Ned Flanders,"How are my boys doin', Homer?"
Homer Simpson,They're fine.
,
Marge Simpson,There. I hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
Lisa Simpson,We got the recipe from the Fruit Punch Advisory Board.
Maude Flanders,"Oh gosh, I'm sorry, our boys don't eat sugar."
Marge Simpson,"But, why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice?"
Maude Flanders,No sugar!
Lisa Simpson,
Rod Flanders,"Thank you, but we're not allowed."
Bart Simpson,"Aw it's okay, there's no sugar in pixie sticks. Trust me."
Rod Flanders,Okay.
Rod Flanders,"Don't hog it all, smellyhead!"
Todd Flanders,"Go to hell, zit face!"
Bart Simpson,
Todd Flanders,Lies made baby Jesus cry.
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to propose a toast to the coming together of the Simpsons and the Flanders. If this were a more perfect world, we'd all be known as the Flimpsons."
Homer Simpson,"So, here's to my best friend, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"Eh, well sir. My entire family is very touched and--"
Homer Simpson,Food fight!
Bart Simpson,Yeah!
,
Homer Simpson,Whatcha doin'?
Ned Flanders,We're headin' back. Todd's got Zesty Italian in his eye.
Homer Simpson,Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I don't know..."
Homer Simpson,Too late.
Ned Flanders,"Oh Lord, please give me the strength to endure Homer Simpson's friendship."
Homer Simpson,"Humph, your car. Boy, what are the odds, huh?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Cheers to Homer Simpson for all his recent charity work.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Jeers to this rusty tailgate.
,
Ned Flanders,There's Homer. There's Homer too. That's also Homer. That's Homer.
,
Maude Flanders,"What's the matter, Ned?"
Ned Flanders,I -- I think I hate Homer Simpson.
Maude Flanders,
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! I think I hate Ted Koppel. No wait, I find him informative and witty. 'Nite."
,
Todd Flanders,Off the rim!
Ned Flanders,Oh! Almost. Boy that was close.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's up for today, Neddie?"
Ned Flanders,"Ah, uh, Homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. Family only. You know?"
Homer Simpson,"Right, no reporters."
Ned Flanders,"No, I-I mean just the Flanders family."
Homer Simpson,O-okay.
Rod Flanders,Oh boy! Gramma!
Ned Flanders,We're not going anywhere.
Todd Flanders,But you said.
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
Homer Simpson,Neddie? NEDDDDIEEE!
,
Rod Flanders,He's gaining on us!
Todd Flanders,I'm scared!
Maude Flanders,C'mon Ned! Move this thing!
Ned Flanders,"I can't, it's a Geo!"
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. Guess he didn't see me.
Ned Flanders,"We did it, we got rid of..."
,
Ned Flanders,"I told you, officer. I'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
Chief Wiggum,Yeah right.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ned Flanders, I never would have imagined."
Chief Wiggum,"High as a kite, everybody! Goofballs--"
Chief Wiggum,"Where's your messiah now, Flanders?"
,
Ned Flanders,"I can't do it, Maude. I can't face their accusing eyes."
Maude Flanders,"Oh don't worry, Ned, this is a house of love and forgiveness."
Voice #1,"There he is, Ned Flanders."
Voice #2,The fallen one.
Voice #3,The evil one.
Voice #4,"I'll bet he's the one who wrote ""Homer"" all over the bathroom."
Ned Flanders,I think we should leave.
Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Before I get started on today's sermon entitled , ""What Ned Did,"" I'd like to publicly congratulate Homer Simpson on his recent charity work."
Homer Simpson,I live to give.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"That's beautiful. We appreciate the kisses. Now, let us bow our heads in a silent prayer of thanksgiving."
Ned Flanders,Stop it! Breathe through your damn mouth!
Ned Flanders,"Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!"
Helen Lovejoy,Well Ned Flanders is just jealous!
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, the guy's hepped up on ""goof balls!"""
Grampa Simpson,"Let's sacrifice him to our god! C'mon, we did it all the time in the thirties."
Congregation,
Homer Simpson,"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that! He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me. There have been times when I've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. But this man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. We'd already be there."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Um... Well I think we all owe Ned a heartfelt apology. We were wrong to doubt him.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, that guy's right!"
Congregation,
Marge Simpson,"That was a very nice thing you did, Homey."
Ned Flanders,"Thank you. Thank you so much, Homer. You really are a you're a true friend."
Homer Simpson,"Right back atcha, buddy."
Homer Simpson,Now how 'bout that game at the Pitch 'n Putt?
Ned Flanders,Just try and stop me.
Bart Simpson,"I don't get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends."
Lisa Simpson,Yeah. Maybe this means the end of our wacky adventures.
,
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there."
Ned Flanders,"Hi-diddly ho, neighbor."
Homer Simpson,"Get lost, Flanders."
Ned Flanders,Okilly-dokilly.
Homer Simpson,"See, I told ya. There's nothin' to worry about. This place isn't..."
,
Marge Simpson,Sandwich.
Marge Simpson,Underpants.
,
Marge Simpson,Bowling ball... more underpants...
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Mom."
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Mom."
Bart Simpson,After breakfast me and Milhouse are goin' down to the ravine. We got a tip from a six year old that there's a dead Martian down there.
Lisa Simpson,"And I'm going to the park to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet. Wanna come with me, Daddy-o?"
Bill Clinton,Make me.
C. Montgomery Burns,Eeeeeee!!
Homer Simpson,"I'd love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today."
Bart Simpson,Think you'll win?
Homer Simpson,"Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. It's how drunk you get."
Bart Simpson,"Gotcha. Well, gotta go."
Lisa Simpson,Me too.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom."
Homer Simpson,"Push her down, son."
Marge Simpson,No one's going anywhere. We're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Oh dear God, no."
Marge Simpson,I think you'll find that escape is impossible. Now each one of you take a floor and get started.
Homer Simpson,I call the basement.
Marge Simpson,Fine.
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,I'm tired. I'm hungry. Can't we just buy a new house?
Marge Simpson,Oh Bart. Cleaning doesn't have to be a chore. Here... work to the music.
Ernie Ford,YOU LOAD SIXTEEN TONS/ WHADDAYA GET/ ANOTHER DAY OLDER AND DEEPER IN DEBT...
Bart Simpson,"Amen, Ernie."
Homer Simpson,All done.
Marge Simpson,You're not done. I want you to throw away these old calendars and TV Guides.
Homer Simpson,"Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories."
Homer Simpson,"""Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter."" Ooooh, I'll never forget that episode!"
Carter,Pyle!
Gomer,Shazam!
Carter,Pyle!
Gomer,Shazam!
Carter,Pyle!
Gomer,Shazam!
Homer Simpson,Shazam.
Marge Simpson,Stop remembering TV and get back to work.
Homer Simpson,What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain?
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Clinton, get back to work!"
Lisa Simpson,They're having a great time and I'm stuck in here.
Saxophone,Wah-wah.
Homer Simpson,Use only in a well ventilated area.
Homer Simpson,"Shove it, buddy."
Mr. Clean-style Character,I - must - destroy - you!
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what's going on down there?"
Homer Simpson,Nothing.
Marge Simpson,Then stop screaming so loud.
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,
Bill,"And that was ""Take this job and shove it."" Now let's make another one of our lucky phone calls."
Marty,"Okay, just answer the phone with THE SPECIAL PHRASE THAT PAYS and you'll have your choice of ten thousand dollars in cash."
Marty,Or a really stupid prize.
Bill,"Well, let's make that call."
Bart Simpson,KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Grampa Simpson,"Bart, I'm having palpitations."
Bart Simpson,"Can't tie up the line, Grampa."
Marge Simpson,There! Isn't that a lot better? Now you can do whatever you want. But don't mess up the house.
Lisa Simpson,We won't.
Marge Simpson,
Bill,And now let's try another lucky phone call.
,
Chief Wiggum,"Help! Help us! They stole our uniforms, guns and tasers!"
Snake Jailbird,"Fry, Piggy."
,
Chief Wiggum,"No! No! No, don't! A little to the left... Ah. That's the stuff."
Marty,"Oh, I'm sorry. The phrase is ""KBBL is gonna give me something stupid."""
Goofy Recording,Pret-ty wee-ird!
Bill,Let's try one more number.
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Y'ello.
Bart Simpson,KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Bill,"Well, hot dog! We have a ""wiener""!"
Homer Simpson,Y'ello?
Bart Simpson,I won! I won!
Bart Simpson,Where's my elephant?!
Marty,"You win your choice of ten thousand dollars or - what's our gag prize this week, Bill? - a full grown African elephant!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty. But I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant."
Homer Simpson,He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
Bill,The kid wants the elephant.
Marty,We don't have a damn elephant!
Bill,Don't whisper into the Mic.
Marty,"Kid, the elephant's a gag prize. Nobody takes the gag prize. You want the cash."
Bart Simpson,I want the elephant.
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. Stick it to the man. No, wait!"
Homer Simpson,"We'll call you back! Bart! With ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. We could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love."
Marge Simpson,Or double-ply windows! They look just like regular windows but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill...
Marge Simpson,"Well, they will."
Lisa Simpson,You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. Which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, go to your room."
,
,
Bill,"We appreciate you coming down but, look kid, the thing is, uh we don't have an elephant."
Marty,"Come on, kid, just take the money, huh? Otherwise we might get fired. You don't want us to get fired, do you?"
Bart Simpson,"Eh, either way."
Marty,
,
Seymour Skinner,"I'll do it, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Umm... No.
Marty,"Okay, okay. What if we use the ten thousand to surgically transform Skinner here into some kind of a lobster-like creature?"
Seymour Skinner,Now wait just a minute. That wasn't discussed with me.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant."
Bart Simpson,Hey!
Homer Simpson,Wee!
Bart Simpson,Where's my elephant!
Bart Simpson,Where's my elephant!
,
Bart Simpson,Where's my elephant?!
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, they're playing the elephant song."
Jasper Beardly,I love that. It reminds me of elephants.
Kent Brockman,So isn't that what we're all asking in our own lives? Where's my elephant? I know that's what I've been asking.
,
,
Station Owner,"Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped with angry calls and letter bombs."
Station Owner,And it's all your fault.
Marty,"Yes it is, Ma'am."
Station Owner,"This is the DJ3000. It plays CDs automatically, and it has three distinct varieties of inane chatter."
Dj3000,"Hey, hey, how about that weather out there?... Whoa, that was the caller from hell... Well hot dog! We have a wiener..."
Marty,"Man, that thing's great."
Bill,Don't - praise - the - machine.
Station Owner,"If you don't get that kid an elephant by tomorrow, the DJ3000 gets your job."
Dj3000,Looks like those clowns in congress did it again! What a bunch of clowns.
Marty,How's he keep up with the news like that?
,
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Whoa!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it looks like it could gore."
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore."
Bart Simpson,"He smells worse than anything! Hey, you! Elephant! Lift me up on your back, man."
Marge Simpson,Bart!!!
Bart Simpson,Cool! He tried to kill me!
Marge Simpson,I really think this is a bad idea.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory."
Bart Simpson,"Look, he thinks he's people."
,
Bart Simpson,I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
Homer Simpson,What's he yelling about?
,
Lisa Simpson,"He's hungry. Here you go, Stampy. Eat it slow. It has to last for..."
Lisa Simpson,You ate it too fast.
Homer Simpson,Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
Lisa Simpson,"You can't do that, Dad. It's cruel."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So excuse me if I'm cruel."
Homer Simpson,"Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth."
,
Moe Szyslak,I think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.
Homer Simpson,Shut up.
,
Lisa Simpson,"He can't just eat peanuts, Dad. He needs plants to live."
Homer Simpson,"Plants, eh?"
,
Bart Simpson,"Strip the bark now, Stampy."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, any more arboretums around here?"
Arboretum Guy,No.
Homer Simpson,That bird! He's killing the elephant! Stop him!
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad. He's grooming him."
Homer Simpson,"Grooming him, eh?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Ew, Homer, there is a bird on your head?"
Homer Simpson,I know. He's grooming me. Mmm... elephant fresh.
,
,
Bart Simpson,"G'night, Stampy."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, bud. 'Preciate it."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Nah. He doesn't want to learn and I don't want to teach him. We get along fine.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's with them?"
Lisa Simpson,I think they're trying to get some attention.
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. ""Chain for elephant,"" ""Shots for elephant""... ""Oversized decorative poncho""."
Bart Simpson,"Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little."
Homer Simpson,Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
Bart Simpson,You'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
Homer Simpson,"Then that's what I'll do, smart guy."
,
Small Kid,Can we see the elephant?
MEDIUM-SIZED KID,We'll pay you money.
Homer Simpson,"For the ninth time, no!"
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, this gives me an idea."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, here's a better sign, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son."
,
Homer Simpson,Your kid flew five feet. That counts as a ride. Two bucks.
Kid's Mother,"Well, that was never five feet."
Helen Lovejoy,That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels."
Cletus Spuckler,"Hey, Maw. Look at that pointy-haired little girl."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,You guys don't understand Stampy. He's just like me. We're a pair of jokers and both of us are wild. We don't take nothin' from nobody.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, this reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work."
,
Homer Simpson,"Look at this, Marge! Fifty-eight dollars! And all of it profit! I'm the smartest businessman in the world!"
Marge Simpson,Stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once. Right?"
Luann Van Houten,Yes. But we paid you four dollars.
Homer Simpson,"Well, that was under our old price structure. Under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. Now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me."
Kirk Van Houten,Get off our property.
Homer Simpson,This town is full of deadbeats. We can't afford this elephant.
Bart Simpson,"No, Dad, he's my friend!"
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him."
,
Grizzled Guy,"Well sir, I'll be honest with you. I need a large African elephant. And I need it today. But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm lookin' for."
Homer Simpson,"What do you mean? It's an elephant, isn't it?"
Grizzled Guy,"Well it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean."
Homer Simpson,He likes peanuts.
,
Wildlife Man,Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant. Thousands of acres of simulated African Savannah.
Lisa Simpson,"It's perfect, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"I only have two questions. How much, and give it to me."
Wildlife Man,Well we really can't offer you any money. We're a non-profit organization.
Homer Simpson,"So, your bid is zero."
Wildlife Man,"Well, we like to think of it as --"
Homer Simpson,Thank you.
Wildlife Man,You know I really think --
Homer Simpson,Thank you.
,
Ivory Dealer,"Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer. His boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low."
Santa's Little Helper,
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Blackheart?
Ivory Dealer,"Yes, my pretty?"
Lisa Simpson,Are you an ivory dealer?
Ivory Dealer,"Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day. Whale hunter, seal clubber, President of the Fox Network. And like most people, yeah I've dealt a little ivory."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you can't do this. Stampy is my friend."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. I'll get you a new elephant."
Ivory Dealer,"I'll take that one, too."
Homer Simpson,Done.
Ivory Dealer,"All right, I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy."
Homer Simpson,Here's the keys.
Ivory Dealer,Elephants don't have keys.
Homer Simpson,I'll just keep these then.
,
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Stampy. I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer."
Bart Simpson,"You and I are gonna run away together. We'll keep to the back roads, and make our way South. Then, if I know my geography, it's just twelve miles to Africa. Okay bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through..."
Bart Simpson,Stampy!
,
Ned Flanders,It's the Four Elephants of the Apocalypse!
Maude Flanders,"That's horsemen, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"Well, gettin' closer."
,
Lisa Simpson,Mom! Dad! Bart and Stampy are gone!
Marge Simpson,Oh my Lord!
Lisa Simpson,"I'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad."
Homer Simpson,He took Bart too?
Homer Simpson,"That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!"
,
Homer Simpson,Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Homer Simpson,Stupid tornado. look. It got Patty and Selma.
Patty Bouvier,"Ooh, I fell it all the way up my skirt."
Selma Bouvier,Ditto.
,
,
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah right, lady. An elephant ran through your front yard. Okay."
Chief Wiggum,"Wiggum? Yeah right, mister. Mm hm. An elephant just knocked over your mailbox. Okay."
Chief Wiggum,"Wiggum? Yeah right, buddy. Liquor store robbery, officer down. Sure, and I'm Edward G. Robinson."
Chief Wiggum,
,
,
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Elephant, honey. It's an elephant. And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano."
Foreman,"Oh! This is the moment we've feared, people. Many of you thought it would never happen. But I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it. You all thought I was mad. Many of you requested to be transferred to another peanut factory. But now..."
,
Bart Simpson,"Stampy! Stampy! Where are you, boy?"
Bart Simpson,
,
Speaker Box,"These prehistoric creatures blundered into the tar pits, which preserved their skeletons in showroom condition."
Bart Simpson,He's gone forever.
Bart Simpson,Stampy!
Bart Simpson,"Ahhh. You're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?"
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,A deer!
Marge Simpson,A female deer.
Homer Simpson,"Son, you're okay! And you've led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to..."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I can't let you sell him. Stampy and I are friends."
Bart Simpson,"Ow. Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge."
Homer Simpson,Forget it. That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?"
Homer Simpson,I'd like it fine.
Bart Simpson,Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene..."
Lisa Simpson,Dad! You're sinking!
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Marge Simpson,"Get a rope, Bart!"
Homer Simpson,"Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out."
Homer Simpson,Now I'll pull my arms out with my face...
Lisa Simpson,Dad!
Marge Simpson,Homie!
Bart Simpson,"Stampy, quick! Pull him out!"
Barney Gumble,"Thanks, Stampy."
Barney Gumble,Ow!
Homer Simpson,I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, feline means cat."
Lisa Simpson,Dad!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"On the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products."
Homer Simpson,All right. We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Mom. We're stuck to Dad."
Marge Simpson,This is just what happened at the caramel factory.
Lisa Simpson,Ow! My hair!
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Caramel.
,
Bart Simpson,So long Stampy. I know you're gonna like it here.
Bart Simpson,"No, Stampy. No!"
Bart Simpson,"Ah, thanks, boy."
Bart Simpson,"Whoa! Whoa, boy!"
Bart Simpson,"Atta boy, Stampy. Butt 'em once for me!"
Marge Simpson,"Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat."
Wildlife Man,"Oh, I think he is."
Marge Simpson,Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Wildlife Man,"Well, animals are a lot like people, Mrs. Simpson. Some of them act badly because they've had a hard life or have been mistreated. But, like people, some of them are just jerks. Stop that, Mr. Simpson."
,
Homer Simpson,Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.
GAME SHOW MAN,Congratulations Homer Simpson! You've just won the employee raffle!
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! What do I get?
GAME SHOW MAN,The job of industrial chimney sweep for a day!
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this isn't such a great prize. Oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Will five o'clock never come?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Careful, Smithers, that sponge has corners you know."
,
Waylon Smithers,I'll go find a spherical one.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Help, Smithers! I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Life... flashing... before...eyes."
Baby Burns,You fired!
Teenage Burns,Dance!
Teenage Burns,Dance!
Greenpeace Hippie #1,"All right, we're finally gonna stop those corporate pigs from dumping that nuclear waste."
Greenpeace Hippie #2,"Oh no, our boat is sinking."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It was I, you fools! The man you trusted isn't Wavy Gravy at all!"
C. Montgomery Burns,And all this time I've been smoking harmless tobacco.
Waylon Smithers,"I got a mink shammy, sir. I hope that... Oh my god, Mr. Burns is dead! Why do the good always die so young?!"
C. Montgomery Burns,You almost killed me!
Waylon Smithers,Please... sir! You'll catch cold.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, do you realize, if I had died there would be no one to carry on my legacy? Due to my hectic schedule and lethargic sperm, I never fathered an heir. Now I have no one to leave my enormous fortune to. No one."
Waylon Smithers,
C. Montgomery Burns,"You, Smithers? Oh no, my dear friend, I've planned a far greater reward for you. When I pass on, you shall be buried alive with me."
Waylon Smithers,Oh... goody.
,
,
Grampa Simpson,Turn it up! Turn it up!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, I am Montgomery Burns."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young, male heir to leave my fortune to when I pass away. My vast, vast, vast fortune. Vast."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Auditions will be tomorrow at my estate. And now, our feature presentation."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh for... Oh, very well."
C. Montgomery Burns,"LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY, GET OURSELVES SOME SNACKS...."
,
Chief Wiggum,Now what are the two things? Enunciate and energate.
Seymour Skinner,"I know, Mother."
Milhouse Van Houten,I have nothing to offer you but my love.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I specifically said ""No geeks!"""
Milhouse Van Houten,But my mom says I'm cool.
C. Montgomery Burns,Next.
Nelson Muntz,Gimme your fortune or I'll pound your withered old face in.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I like his energy. Put him on the call back list."
Martin Prince,"CLANG, CLANG, CLANG WENT THE TROLLEY / RING, RING, RING WENT THE BELL / ZING, ZING, ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Thank you. Give the bully an extra point.
Lisa Simpson,I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. In this phallocentric society of ours...
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't know what ""phallocentric"" means, but no girls."
Milhouse Van Houten,So much for Plan B.
Homer Simpson,"That's it, boy. You're our last hope."
Bart Simpson,"I just don't want to be here, Dad. Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. This could provide for your entire future."
Professor,"Congratulations, you've just graduated from the most expensive and therefore best school there is."
Lee Majors,"Hello, Marge, I'm Lee Majors. Will you come away with me?"
Marge Simpson,"Uh, sure."
Marge Simpson,"I've gotta stop fantasizing about Lee Majors. Ah, one more."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in."
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick."
Homer Simpson,Oooh. He card reads good.
Bart Simpson,"So pick, please, me... Mr. Burns."
Homer Simpson,"It's KURNS, stupid!"
Marge Simpson,No it's not.
Homer Simpson,Disregard.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, he's the worst yet! That's it! Everyone out! Except you! One step to the left."
Bart Simpson,Ow!
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Homer Simpson,The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now. Isn't there something you'd like to say?
Homer Simpson,"There sure is. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Right in the butt. That was great."
Bart Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's no use. I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council. Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh look, a bird has become petrified and lost its sense of direction."
Waylon Smithers,"I think it's a rock, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, we'll see what the lab has to say about that."
C. Montgomery Burns,Why that rapscallion is breaking all my windows.
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look Smithers, a creature of pure malevolence. He's the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You there, boy! What day is this?"
Street Urchin,"Today? Sir, why it's Christmas day."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I was talking to him. You, what day is this?"
Bart Simpson,Huh?
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll tell you what day it is. Today is the day you become my heir!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, I like him a lot."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Just sign here and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate.
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! We're rich! Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. We want to get the old people smell out before we move in."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet."
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, right. So I guess you're in okay shape, huh? No heart problems or anything..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I --"
Homer Simpson,Boo!
Grampa Simpson,I'm okay.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. So good..."
Bart Simpson,That explains his mysterious trip to Holland.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death, I must return to my large empty mansion to rattle around and await the inevitable... alone."
Marge Simpson,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, let's push him down the steps."
Marge Simpson,"No. You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him."
Bart Simpson,Well...
Marge Simpson,"C'mon, honey."
Bart Simpson,All right.
Homer Simpson,How come Bart gets to do that and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of ""booger man,"" but I'm really not such a bad ""dude."" Oh, your milk's gone cold. I'll ring for the maid."
Bart Simpson,Whoa.
C. Montgomery Burns,Sorry. Wrong button.
Bart Simpson,"Um, uh, I think I'd like to go home."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Aw, if you stay you can have anything you want to eat, even some sort of gelatin dish. It's made from hooves, you know."
Bart Simpson,"Anything, huh? Okay... I want pizza, and I want it delivered by Krusty the Clown."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, it's Krusty the pizza man! -- All right, where's my four hundred bucks?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait! How can you be here when your show's on live?"
Krusty the Clown,"Ah, I just threw on an old rerun. No one will know the difference."
Krusty the Clown,"Children, remain calm. The Falkland Islands have just been invaded! I repeat, the Falklands have just been invaded."
Krusty the Clown,"The disputed islands lie here, off the coast of Argentina."
Krusty the Clown,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"This is my pride and joy. I've had hidden cameras planted in every home in Springfield. I got the idea from that movie ""Sliver."" What a delightful romp!"
Moe Szyslak,Are you talkin' to me? There's no one else here. You must be talkin' to me.
Moe Szyslak,Well that was an antique. Crap.
,
Bart Simpson,"...And I had the greatest time. Mr. Burns' house has everything - a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors, and a bottomless pit."
Lisa Simpson,It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
Bart Simpson,"Well, for all intents and purposes."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey Mom, Bart's throwing peas."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
Bart Simpson,Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
Lisa Simpson,Ow! That was a big one.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, say something."
Homer Simpson,Okay. Lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Oh yuck, meatloaf! My most hated of all loafs."
Homer Simpson,That was the end piece. That's it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!
Bart Simpson,No! This family stinks. Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side. I'm suffocating here.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you listen."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, go eat some flowers."
Homer Simpson,My secret shame.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, my plan worked perfectly. Bart Simpson will live here as my son, and I will mold him in my own graven image. Who knows, I may even grow to love him. Bartholomew!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Ugh! Smithers get it off me.
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you're coming home."
Bart Simpson,I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns,I suggest you leave immediately.
Homer Simpson,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
Homer Simpson,He locked the door! I'll show him.
,
Marge Simpson,I'm very concerned. Mr. Burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.
Chief Wiggum,"Oh for gosh, can't you people solve these problems yourselves? I mean we can't be uh ""Policing"" the whole city."
Lionel Hutz,Damn clogs. Well you good folks can rest easy now because you've come to the very best in legal representation.
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, excuse me, is there an Orange Julius stand on this floor?"
Lionel Hutz,I'll sell you this one. It's almost full.
Seymour Skinner,Well why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
Lionel Hutz,He'll be back. And as for your case - don't you worry. I've argued in front of every judge in the state. Often as a lawyer.
,
Judge Snyder,This court rules in favor of Montgomery Burns. I find that he is clearly the boy's biological father.
Lionel Hutz,"Uh, judge, these won't be ready until Thursday."
Marge Simpson,You know we should really stop hiring him.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Cool train. Where's it go?
Bart Simpson,Beats me. But it won't be back for three hours and forty minutes. Once it had snow on it.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow, Bart! Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want. My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys. Well, I'm sure you'd like to be alone with your possessions."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer, you can have this blazer. It's a Bob Mackie original."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow, a Bob Mackie! ...Sorry, Bart."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bartholomew, you don't need him. I can be your schoolyard chum!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Five, twenty-three skidoo! Hut! Hut!"
Bart Simpson,For me? But I don't know how to drive.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, pish posh. There's a jaws of life in the trunk."
,
Bart Simpson,That was some ride.
Elf,You're telling me.
,
Deprogrammer,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, your son has clearly been brainwashed by the evil and charismatic Mr. Burns."
Marge Simpson,Are you sure you can get him back for us?
Deprogrammer,"Absolutely. I'm the one who successfully deprogrammed Jane Fonda, you know."
Marge Simpson,What about Peter Fonda?
Deprogrammer,"That was a heartbreaker. But I did get Paul McCartney out of ""Wings."""
Homer Simpson,You idiot! He was the most talented one!
,
Deprogrammer,You do not love Mr. Burns. You love Homer and Marge! You are their son!
Deprogrammer,What you are doing is wrong... wrong... wrong!
Mayor Joe Quimby,Do you mind? You're killing the romance in here.
Deprogrammer,"Well, it was a grueling two weeks but you have your son back."
Hans Moleman,"Mom, Dad, I missed you."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's Hans Moleman."
Homer Simpson,"Can I keep him anyway? Huh, huh?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,That was delightful! Did you see that? That mouse butchered that cat like a hog! Is all TV this wonderful?
Bart Simpson,"Um, I'd kind of like to go home now."
C. Montgomery Burns,Like a hog! Heh? What? What was that?
Bart Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful. But, I want to go home to my family."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this, but... I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back."
,
Homer,I do not miss Bart at all.
Marge,I am glad he's gone.
Lisa,As am I.
Homer,B'oh!
Bart Simpson,It's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.
C. Montgomery Burns,Really? Excuse me for just a moment.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"People, that was all wrong. Homer Simpson doesn't say ""B'oh!"" he says... ""D'oh!"""
Homer Actor,"Sorry, M.B., but I'm having trouble with this character. Is he supposed to have some kind of neurological impairment like ""Rainman,"" or ""Awakenings""? I mean, what the Hell am I doing here?"
Marge Actress,"And this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of ""Murphy Brown."""
Lisa Actress,"Hey, ya know, we're getting into golden-time here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, just get it right or you'll all be back doing ""Come Blow your Horn"" at the Westport Dinner Theater!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right then, let's see what the old Simpson family is up to now."
Homer,D'oh!
Bart Simpson,That's them all right. I can't believe it. I guess you're the only one I can trust...
Bart Simpson,... Dad.
C. Montgomery Burns,That rib always breaks.
,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, what are you doing?"
Lisa Simpson,"Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction that Bart's absence has left in our hearts."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"That's sweet, honey."
,
Bart Simpson,It's a little tight.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, that's to correct your posture. Soon you'll have a mighty hump."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, you really are my son. This calls for a celebration. Let's fire some employees."
Bart Simpson,Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, let's make this sporting, Leonard. If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you, without using the letter ""E,"" you can keep your job."
Lenny Leonard,"Uh, okay... um... I'm a good... work... guy."
C. Montgomery Burns,You're fired.
Lenny Leonard,But I didn't say --
C. Montgomery Burns,You will.
Lenny Leonard,Eeeeeeeeeeeee!!
Bart Simpson,Let me try one.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!"
Bart Simpson,Homer!
C. Montgomery Burns,Huh! What a coincidence. And a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty. Go ahead Bartholomew. You may fire when ready.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hurry! Fire him now or I'll disown you. You'll lose everything. The fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury, the gift certificate from Blockbuster Video, the freedom to do whatever you want."
Homer Simpson,"I'll miss you, son."
Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry, Dad... You're fired!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"What? Fire me? That does it, you can never be my son..."
Bart Simpson,A little to the left.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Huh? Oh, very well. You can never be my..."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us."
Bart Simpson,How do you know?
Homer Simpson,Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, me too. That midget taught me a lot about his native Estonia."
Marge Simpson,The point is the real Simpson family missed you a lot and we're really glad you're home.
Bart Simpson,I love you guys.
Homer Simpson,"Right back atcha, son. Aw."
Homer Simpson,"And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman."
Hans Moleman,"Cowabunga, dudes."
Homer Simpson,"Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I want that thing out of my house."
Bart Simpson,They're gonna eat this up at Show and Tell.
,
Marge Simpson,"I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our family's private moments. How would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?"
Bart Simpson,"Not likely. C'mon, have a sense of humor about yourself!"
Baby Bart,I'm a big boy today.
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Argh! I gotta find something else quick!
Marge Simpson,Why don't you bring this potato? It's pretty big.
Bart Simpson,"Mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. What is it with you?"
Marge Simpson,I just think they're neat.
,
Bart Simpson,I need something for Show and Tell.
Lisa Simpson,Just take one of my geodes. The rocks on my desk.
Lisa Simpson,"No, that's a Trilobite... That's petrified wood... Bart, that's a bran"
Lisa Simpson,muffin.
,
Martin Prince,"Greetings, fellow geodologist."
Bart Simpson,I'll be right back.
Nelson Muntz,"The ingredients were ""Fresh pureed tomatoes, water, salt, and Sodium Benzoate used to retard spoilage."" Once again, if I'm not mistaken, this can contained tomato paste."
Edna Krabappel,"Thank you, Nelson. I look forward to seeing it again next week. Bart, you're up."
Bart Simpson,"Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- What has four legs and ticks?"
Milhouse Van Houten,A walking clock?
Nelson Muntz,A walkin'-clock!
Martin Prince,I'd wager he has some variety of walking clock in that box.
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, is it a walking clock?"
Bart Simpson,"What? No, it's my dog!"
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, he is a gem! Here, boy, would you like these cookies Martin made for me?"
Martin Prince,My raisin roundies!
Bart Simpson,"My dog's name is Santa's Little Helper. One time he crawled under the house, and when he came out he was covered with ants. Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water."
Class,Wow!
Edna Krabappel,"Thank you, Bart. Great job."
Milhouse Van Houten,I knew the dog before he came to class.
Martin Prince,"Ka-Boom!! That, the sound of the thunderous volcanic explosion which gives birth to the magnificent geode! One of nature's most..."
Nelson Muntz,You're doin' it wrong. You gotta pet him hard so he can feel it.
Sherri Mackleberry,Looklooklook! The doggie sneezed!
Edna Krabappel,Ha! It thinks it's people!
Groundskeeper Willie,"Hey, poochie. Poochie-poochie, poochie."
Martin Prince,My geode must be acknowledged.
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, brother. All right, back to Show and Tell. Bart, why don't you put the doggie away."
Class,
Lunchlady Doris,More testicles mean more iron.
Ralph Wiggum,"Um, Miss Hoover? There's a dog in the vent."
Miss Hoover,"Ralph, remember the time you said Snagglepuss was outside?"
Ralph Wiggum,He was going to the bathroom.
Seymour Skinner,"I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent, but, but ah, I was sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it sounds so made up: ""Yom Kip-pur?"""
Groundskeeper Willie,"Sir, ye've goot to coom quick! There's a doog roonin' aroond in the air doocts!"
Seymour Skinner,"I understand. Children, this is Principal Skinner..."
Seymour Skinner,Remain calm. There is a dog in the vents.
Seymour Skinner,"Willie, go into the vent and get him."
Groundskeeper Willie,"What?! Have ye gone waxy in yer beester?! I canna fit in the wee vent, ye croquet-playin' mint-muncher!"
Seymour Skinner,"Grease yourself up and go in, you-you... guff-speaking work-slacker."
Groundskeeper Willie,Ooh. Good coomback.
Groundskeeper Willie,"Lunchlady Doris, have ye got any grease?"
Lunchlady Doris,Yes. Yes we do.
Groundskeeper Willie,"Then grease me up, woman!"
Lunchlady Doris,Okey dokey.
Seymour Skinner,Good lord! It's coming up right behind him!
Groundskeeper Willie,What the? No! No!
Groundskeeper Willie,Ouch! Ouch! Stop it!
Seymour Skinner,"Children, teachers, back to your rooms! Uh-oh, whenever I get this upset, I get hiccups. Ooh, right on cue."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Aha! There's nary an animal alive that can outrun a greased Scotsman! Now, out we go."
Groundskeeper Willie,Whoogh! 'Tis more dizzying than the belfry at St. Corgegluynwaagen's!
Chief Wiggum,"That's nice work, boys."
Edna Krabappel,Uh-oh. Someone's getting a visit from Superintendent Chalmers.
Seymour Skinner,I ... can't ... take ... this .
Gary Chalmers,Skinner!
Seymour Skinner,"Superintendent Chalmers, you didn't have to come all the way down here. Everything's under control."
Gary Chalmers,"Ooh, I have had it. I have had it with this school, Skinner: the low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children..."
Seymour Skinner,"Now, really I hardly think the children's appearance should --"
Gary Chalmers,"Seymour, you are in very, very big troub--"
Gary Chalmers,"Huh? Why, looking into this lovable mutt's eyes just melts my heart... Seymour, all is forgiven--"
Groundskeeper Willie,Aah! Make way for Willie!
Groundskeeper Willie,"I said, 'Make way for Willie,' ye bloated gas-bag!"
Gary Chalmers,Seymour?
Seymour Skinner,Hmm?
Gary Chalmers,You're fired.
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,"I'm sorry, d-did you just call me a liar?"
Gary Chalmers,"No, I said you were fired."
Seymour Skinner,Oh. That's much worse.
,
Bart Simpson,"I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left, but now all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head."
Lisa Simpson,That's guilt. You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I guess it is guilt."
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, yeah, but --"
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm off to work."
Marge Simpson,The dog has had enough excitement.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, dogs can never have enough excitement."
Homer Simpson,"Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
,
Gary Chalmers,"Boys and girls, because of Mr. Skinner's sudden departure, I've had to appoint a new principal. Leopold?"
Leopold,"All right, you little punks, prick up your freaking ears, because I'm only gonna be saying this once. From now on, things are gonna be very, very different around here..."
Kids,
Leopold,"...with your new principal, Ned Flanders!"
Homer Simpson,"How many ""s""'s in ""innocent""?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, tippity-top o' the a.m. to every-good-body here! As chairman of the PTA, I Am dee-diddily-lighted to take over, and I think I can put the ""pal"" back in principal."
Gary Chalmers,"Yeah, and I'll put the ""super"" back in superintendent."
,
Ned Flanders,Now I know everybody's eager to get back to class --
Edna Krabappel,Ha!
Ned Flanders,But I thought it might break the ice if we had a little Q and A.
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Dude, ask a question or we'll have to go back to class."
Jimbo Jones,Um...
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, you."
Jimbo Jones,"Ah, yeah, uh, I was wonderin' d-do you, uh, er, what's your, um, policy, on... um, lunch?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, let me just say I want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
Gary Chalmers,It's just a damn popularity contest with you kids.
Leopold,Now look what you've done you little freaks!
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Young men! Your gargantuan cone is making a mockery of our self-serve policy!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, look. It's Principal Skinner, and I think he's gone crazy. He's not wearing a suit or tie or anything!"
Bart Simpson,"Principal Skinner... Um, I'm real sorry about my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it on with your leg."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, maybe it was for the best. Now I... I finally have time to do what I've always wanted: write the Great American Novel. Mine is about a futuristic amusement park where dinosaurs are brought to life through advanced cloning techniques!"
Seymour Skinner,"I call it ""Billy and the Clone-o-saurus!"""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh you have got to be kidding, sir! First, you think of an idea that has already been done! And then, you give it a title that nobody could possibly like!! Didn't you think this thr... it was on the best-seller list for 18 months! And every magazine cover...one of the most popular movies of all time! What were you thinking?! I mean, thank you, come again."
,
Jurors,
Ned Flanders,"Bart, I've barely been here a good solid week, and you've been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin' in trouble every hour."
Bart Simpson,Mufft a been a co-in-fa-dince.
Ned Flanders,"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, sorry, were you drinking Slice or Yoo-Hoo?"
,
Seymour Skinner,"Well, let's see. Tide, Cheer, Bold, Biz, Fab, All, Gain, Wisk. I believe today I will try... Bold."
Seymour Skinner,Bart! How are you? How's school?
Bart Simpson,"Um, it's, it's a lot of fun."
Seymour Skinner,
Bart Simpson,"Well, it was good to see you."
Seymour Skinner,"It was? Well, then we should get together again! Uh, say Saturday, at my house. Do you know where I live?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, no."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm, a flaming bag, eh? Well, these new Italian loafers will make short work of it."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, I'm kinda busy on Saturday."
Seymour Skinner,Hey!
Jimbo Jones,We got Skinner's underpants!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"And there's nothing you can do about it, Mr. Ex-Principal."
Seymour Skinner,"That's not true. I can buy a new pair. No, I can't. I needed those. I really did."
,
Agnes Skinner,"Oh, you must be Seymour's friend. He's up in his room. Don't touch the wallpaper."
Seymour Skinner,Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?
Bart Simpson,"Uh, no I'll pass. Hey, what's this?"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, that's my old unit from Vietnam. I was their Sergeant, they were my loyal troops."
Seymour Skinner,"That photo was taken shortly before I was shot in the back ... Which was very strange, because it was during a Bob Hope show. I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to put on some pants for God's sake."
Agnes Skinner,Seymour! Your friend Bart is here!
Agnes Skinner,"Seymour, do you want me to tell you when it's 7:30?"
Seymour Skinner,"No, Mother."
Seymour Skinner,Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and put the whole school on the honor system?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, and the teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, that place must be falling apart. Oh, mercy. Nobody's mentioned me, have they?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, I thought I heard someone say your name in the cafeteria, but they might've been saying ""skim milk."""
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah, yeah."
Seymour Skinner,"I thought you might like this restaurant, Bart. They'll make a pizza pie with the topping of your choice."
Luigi,"Ay, Seymour! You want-a your usual table?"
Seymour Skinner,"No, no, Luigi, I'd like one with two seats. I'll be dining with a friend tonight."
Luigi,Ay! Good-a for you!! Ay?
Seymour Skinner,Hmm. They treat you real nice here.
Luigi,"Ay, Salvatore! Guess-a who's here? Mr. Cuckoo Labonza, and-a some real ugly kid!"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"This is great. Not only am I not learnin', I'm forgettin' stuff I used to know. And it's all thanks to you, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, great."
Milhouse Van Houten,What's the matter?
Bart Simpson,"Don't you see, Milhouse? We've gone too far. We need Skinner back."
Martin Prince,My water dish is empty!
JANEY,"I learned to read because of you, Principal Skinner."
Martin Prince,"Sir, I baked you these raisin roundies."
Ralph Wiggum,"Principal Skinner, I got car-sick in your office."
,
Agnes Skinner,"Oh, you're Seymour's friend. Here, he left you this note."
Seymour Skinner,"""Dear Bart, your friendship during this difficult time will not be forgotten. However, I've decided to return to the only thing besides school that has ever given my life meaning -- I've re-enlisted in the United States Army. Sincerely, Sgt. Seymour Skinner."""
,
Bart Simpson,Table for one.
Luigi,"Aw, you miss-a your friend, eh? Don't you worry. My cookin', she'll a-cheer you up."
Luigi,"Ay, Salvatore, give-a the ugly kid a plate-a the red crap!"
,
Colonel,It's good to have another combat veteran around here. I myself received a number of medals for uh securing that Montgomery Ward in Kuwait City.
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. Yes, Colonel. Now, I understand it will be my duty to mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly-trained infantry unit."
Colonel,"Sure, I, I guess. Here they come."
Hayseed #1,Hi. Where do I get my grenades at?
Hayseed #2,"Hey, they don't have them group terlets here no more, do they?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the school's being run."
,
Ned Flanders,"Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy."
Ned Flanders,Woopsy-doodle.
Flanders's Beatnik Dad,"Oh maaan! Ned spilled ink all over my poems! He's a real flat tire, I mean a cube, man! He's putting us on the train to Squaresville, Mona!"
,
Company,"I MET A WOMAN IN PARIS, FRANCE /HAD A BIG HOLE IN HER UNDERPA--"
Seymour Skinner,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where did you pick up that filth?!"
Private,"We heard Sergeant Clark's company singing it, sir!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, well, there will be no smut in my company. You're in this man's army to learn!"
Company,"I DON'T KNOW, BUT I BEEN TOLD! / THE PARTHENON IS MIGHTY OLD!"
Seymour Skinner,Howwww old?
Company,WE DON'T KNOW!
Seymour Skinner,"WELL, THAT'S REAL GOOD, BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a square, but there's the proof."
Bart Simpson,"It's weird, Lis. I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more as an enemy."
Lisa Simpson,"I think you need Skinner, Bart. Everybody needs a nemesis. Sherlock Holmes had his Dr. Moriarty. Mountain Dew has its Mello-Yello. Even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow."
,
Seymour Skinner,Man on the range!! Change your trajectories!!!
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Sixteen brand new gas pumps! At last we can compete with the Gas and Gulp!
,
Bart Simpson,"If there was some way to get rid of Flanders, would you want to come back?"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, I must admit, I do miss the school. And uh, frankly, the Army isn't quite as I remembered it."
Rowdy Soldier,"Up yours, sergeant!"
Seymour Skinner,"Actually, it's exactly as I remembered it. I do want to come back, Bart, but it doesn't sound like Flanders is gonna get fired."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I think I can get him fired. I got you fired, didn't I?"
Seymour Skinner,"...Yes. Now you realize, if I become Principal again, we can no longer be friends. Unless you become a good student."
Bart Simpson,"Hmm, that's probably never gonna happen."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, we'll always have the laun-dro-mat."
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
,
Seymour Skinner,What's he doing here?
Bart Simpson,"Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping."
Homer Simpson,That is true.
Bart Simpson,"Here's the plan. Once Chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten, he'll fire Ned on the spot."
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah, well one question remains. How do I get out of the army?"
Bart Simpson,No problem-o. Just make a pass at your commanding officer.
Seymour Skinner,Done and done. And I mean done.
Marge Simpson,What's going on in there?
Seymour Skinner,Nothing!
,
Martin Prince,TO-READOR EN GARDE...
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, Chalmie. You fired Skinner for less than this."
Gary Chalmers,"Yeah, I did, but Skinner really bugged me. Besides, the way America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be this way in a few months. I say lay back and enjoy it. It's a helluva toboggan ride."
Ned Flanders,"Well, cockily-Doodily-Doo, little buddies. Let's thank the Lord for another beautiful school day."
Gary Chalmers,"Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord? That sounded like a prayer! A prayer. A prayer in a public school!! God has no place within these walls, just like facts have no place within organized religion! Simpson, you get your wish. Flanders is history."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I really enjoyed my time here, Superintendent. May the Lord bless and keep you."
Gary Chalmers,"Now take it outside, God-boy."
Ned Flanders,Okily-dokily.
Seymour Skinner,"Dirksen, tuck in your shirt. Jaffee, spit out that gum."
Leopold,You really think it's a good idea to just give that freak his job back?
Gary Chalmers,Eh. He seems to know the students' names.
Bart Simpson,So I guess we're enemies again.
Seymour Skinner,"I guess. Thanks, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Sure.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, mercy."
,
Bart Simpson,How can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like this?
Lisa Simpson,"They're not ""imprisoning us,"" Bart. They're..."
,
Bart Simpson,"A prison bus, Otto?"
Otto Mann,"The regular school bus broke down, so take a seat before I blow your heads off."
Lisa Simpson,Otto!
Otto Mann,"Oh, sorry. This bus and I have sort of a ""Shining"" thing goin' on."
Bart Simpson,"Ah! This is what being a kid is all about. Hey, Huck. What's L-I-N-C-O-N doin' here?"
Huck,I dunno. It's your fantasy.
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Abe."
Abraham Lincoln,"Hello, Bart."
,
Bart Simpson,"Ah, the joys of mortgaging your future."
Bart Simpson,My fantasy's come true.
Lincoln Hobo,Hey kid. Wanna see a dead body?
Edna Krabappel,"Well, children, our new ultra-hard Posturific chairs have arrived. They've been designed by eminent posturologists to eliminate slouching by the year three thousand."
Martin Prince,"Ms. Krabappel, I'm having back spasms."
Edna Krabappel,"I know they seem a little uncomfortable right now, but eventually your bones will change shape."
Milhouse Van Houten,I've lost all feeling in the left side of my body.
Edna Krabappel,"Yeah, yeah. Now, unfortunately, our school clocks have been running fast all semester. So today we all have to stay two extra hours to make up for the time we lost. Ha!"
Freddy,"And to think I got all this after dropping out of the fourth grade! Ha, ha!"
Bart Simpson,That does it. I'm outta here.
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist. I have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework."
Bart Simpson,My mom's number is on there if you want to check up on me.
Edna Krabappel,"That's okay, Bart. I trust you."
,
Seymour Skinner,"""Please excuse my handwriting. I busted whichever hand it is I write with. Signed, Mrs. Simpson."" You were right to be suspicious, Edna. To the crime lab."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm, inconclusive."
Seymour Skinner,I wish more students had agreed to these electronic tracking implants. We only had one volunteer.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,Spill it! Where's yer brither?
Seymour Skinner,"You'd better answer him, Lisa. He's a bad man."
Seymour Skinner,What are you laughing about?
Lisa Simpson,You started off as the bad cop. But now you're the good one. You and Willie got mixed up about ten minutes ago.
Seymour Skinner,We did not! Now where's Bart? You better tell me!
Groundskeeper Willie,"Ach. You'd better tell him, lassie. I canna control him when he gets like this."
Lisa Simpson,Now you're the good cop.
Groundskeeper Willie,Whut?
,
Seymour Skinner,If I were a truant boy out for a good time I'd be right here. The Springfield Natural History Museum.
Seymour Skinner,"You're mine, Simpson."
,
Bart Simpson,"Look, if I was under seventeen, I'd be in school, right?"
Ticket Seller,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Enjoy ""Booborama,"" sir."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Why, there are no children here at the Four 'H' Club either! Am I so out of touch? No. It's the children who are wrong."
,
Auctioneer,Sold to the small man with the runny nose for two point three million.
Auctioneer,"Our next highest bid, uh I believe, was yours sir? For 2.1 million?"
Auctioneer,"Yes, were there any serious bids for this painting?"
,
Bart Simpson,Can't let Dad see me playing hooky.
Homer Simpson,I can't let the boy see me skipping work.
Bart Simpson,Good afternoon.
Homer Simpson,"How do you do, sir?"
Homer Simpson,Sucker.
Seymour Skinner,A Spoor!
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. His brand of gum--Doublemint. Trying to double your fun, eh, Bart? Well, I'll double your detention. I wish someone was around to hear that. And so we enter end game."
Bart Simpson,Aye carumba!
,
Bart Simpson,Let's see him track me now.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, my God, he is like some sort of non... giving up... school guy."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, he's close. I can taste his fear."
Seymour Skinner,What the...?
Bart Simpson,
Girl,"Freddy honey, I think something just dropped into the back seat."
Freddy,I'm not paying you to talk.
,
,
Freddy,Gimme the ball!
Freddy,"People, the punch has been spiked."
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Ha, ha, ha! That's my nephew, displaying the Quimby wit that's won the public's heart. Happy birthday, Freddy, and may all your disgraces be uh private."
Various Quimbys,Here here.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"And who are you, little boy?"
Bart Simpson,I'm one of your nephews you don't see very often. Bart-Bart.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey McBain, I'm a big fan, but your last movie really sucked."
Rainier Wolfcastle,I know. There were script problems from day one.
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, I'll say. Magic ticket my ass, McBain."
Rainier Wolfcastle,"Maria, my mighty heart is breaking. I'll be in the Humvee."
Freddy,"Hey, what the hell is this?"
French Waiter,"It's a bowl of show-dair, sir."
Freddy,Wait a minute. Come here. What did you call it? Say it loud enough for everyone to hear. Come on! Say it.
French Waiter,Show-dair.
Freddy,"Show-dair? ""Show-dair?"" It's ""chowda."" Say it right."
French Waiter,Show-der.
Freddy,Come back here! I'm not through demeaning you.
Bart Simpson,"Wow! This is the biggest Rice Krispy square I've ever seen. Boy, the rich sure know how to live."
Freddy,"Say it, Frenchie! Say chowda!"
French Waiter,Ne-verr!
Freddy,"Okay, you asked for it."
Freddy,I'm gonna enjoy this.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Ah, that's gotta hoit!"
Chief Wiggum,"Oh my God, someone's taken a bite outta the big Rice Krispy Square. Oh, yeah. And the waiter's been brutally beaten."
,
Marge Simpson,It says Freddy Quimby beat a waiter half to death. Those Quimby children are so wild and rich. I hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
Bart Simpson,But Freddy Quimby's innocent.
Lisa Simpson,How do you know? There weren't any witnesses.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Right."
Lisa Simpson,You'd think someone would have seen something at a crowded party like that.
Everyone,Guilty.
Bart Simpson,"Well they didn't, okay? They didn't! It says right here in black and white, no witnesses. Case closed. Now let's all read the funnies."
Bart Simpson,"Oh look, Charlie Brown said ""Good grief."" I didn't see that comin'."
,
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, I gotta tell somebody. I was at the Quimby compound yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked. I know that Freddy Quimby is innocent."
Lisa Simpson,"You're a witness? Bart, you have to tell the police."
Bart Simpson,I can't.
Lisa Simpson,Why?
Seymour Skinner,"Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday. And as soon as I can prove it, I'm shipping you off to the Christian Military Reform School."
Bart Simpson,What he said.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I see. If you testify, Skinner will know you skipped school. Well, if Freddy Quimby didn't do it, I'm sure he'll be found innocent by a fair and impartial jury."
,
Homer Simpson,Jury duty. I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this.
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,I knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.
Announcer #2,Let's go over to the county courthouse live to Kent Brockman.
Kent Brockman,"Brockman, just outside the county courtroom where an argument about chowder has spilled over into the biggest trial in Springfield history. Behind these doors, a Federal judge will ladle out steaming bowls of rich, creamy justice in a case the media have dubbed... ""Beat Up Waiter."" This reporter suggested ""Waiter Gate"" but was shouted down at the press club. Now it's illegal to televise court proceedings in this state, so we'll have to be quiet."
,
Seymour Skinner,"I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little reminder: if I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yes, you heard me. I think words I would never say."
Homer Simpson,"I know you can read my thoughts, boy. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow."
Quimby's Lawyer,"I intend to prove that Freddy Quimby is totally innocent. First of all, his accuser is a very shady character. That waiter, Mr. LaCoste not only wasn't born in Springfield. He wasn't even born in this country!"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, Freddy Quimby was with me the entire night in question. We were collecting canned goods for the starving people in, ah... you know, one of them loser countries."
Audience,He's clearly innocent.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, good. My laundry is done."
Bart Simpson,"Ya see, Lisa? They don't need my testimony."
Lisa Simpson,Only because Mayor Quimby's buying his nephew's freedom.
Bart Simpson,The system works. Just ask Claus Von Bulow.
Lionel Hutz,"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to prove to you not only that Freddy Quimby is guilty, but that he is also innocent of not being guilty. I refer you to my expert witness, Doctor Hibbert."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, only one in two million people has what we call the ""evil gene."" Hitler had it. Walt Disney had it. And Freddy Quimby has it."
Lionel Hutz,"Thank you, Doctor Hibbert. I rest my case."
Judge Snyder,You rest your case?
Lionel Hutz,"What? Oh, no. I thought that was just a figure of speech. Case closed."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Excuse me, your honor. Yes, I'd like to bring something to the court's attention."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Judge Snyder,Give those glasses to the bailiff.
Homer Simpson,All right.
Judge Snyder,And those.
Quimby's Lawyer,"Your honor, even though I've proven my client's innocence, I'd still like to call Freddy Quimby to the stand so that we can all bask in his gentle decency."
Audience,"""He's wealthy, therefore inherently good."" ""He's definitely innocent."""
Quimby's Lawyer,"Mr. Quimby, did you assault Mr. LaCoste?"
Freddy,Of course not. I love each and every uh living thing on God's green earth.
Quimby's Lawyer,"Therefore, you certainly would never lose your temper over something as trivial as the pronunciation of ""chowder."""
Freddy,That's chowda. Chowda! I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you - especially those of you in the jury.
Quimby's Lawyer,"Wow, that didn't go well. The defense rests."
Judge Snyder,Will the jury retire and come to its decision?
Homer Simpson,"Okay, fine."
Helen Lovejoy,This won't take long. He's clearly guilty. We'll probably be home by dinnertime.
Jasper Beardly,"Good. I heard the dog from ""Frasier"" is gonna ride the dolphin on ""Seaquest."""
Lisa Simpson,"Well Bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail."
Bart Simpson,Maybe I should come forward.
Seymour Skinner,I can't wait 'til the sentencing part. That's where I really shine.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart Simpson, for the heinous crime of hooky, I sentence you to a lifetime of hard labor in the cafeteria."
Lunchlady Bart,"More creamed corn, Jimbo Junior?"
JIMBO JR.,This creamed corn tastes like creamed crap.
Lunchlady Bart,"Watch the potty mouth, honey."
Judge Snyder,Your sister says you have something to tell me.
Bart Simpson,"What? Uh, um, yeah. Uh, I just want to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench."
Judge Snyder,Hm.
Bart Simpson,"Keep up the good work, toots."
Lisa Simpson,Chicks on the bench...
,
Jasper Beardly,Why bother votin'? He's guilty.
Ned Flanders,We might as well make it official.
Homer Simpson,What does sequestered mean?
Seymour Skinner,"If the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world."
Homer Simpson,What does deadlocked mean?
Seymour Skinner,It's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. And ""if""?"
Seymour Skinner,"A conjunction meaning ""in the event that"" or ""on condition that."""
Homer Simpson,"So ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the Springfield Palace Hotel."
Patty Bouvier,"That's not gonna happen, Homer."
Jasper Beardly,Let's vote. My liver is failing.
Homer Simpson,"Where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free HBO - Oooh, ""Free Willy!"""
Seymour Skinner,"Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson. It has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. Now let's vote."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, how are the rest of you voting?"
Homer Simpson,I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddie Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can."
Homer Simpson,Room service? Send up two more pot roasts and three more pillows with mints on 'em.
Seymour Skinner,"You know, we're kind of like the original ""Odd Couple."" You're the messy one and I'm..."
Homer Simpson,Shut up.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh yes, very well."
,
Lisa Simpson,"So Bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt, yet?"
Bart Simpson,"Sell it to Hallmark, sis. You're lookin' at cucumber boy. As in ""cool as a."""
Announcer,Next on McGarnigal - McGarnigal is framed for a crime he didn't commit. And only one witness can clear his name - a little sissy boy who's too scared to come forward.
MCGARNIGAL,"You gotta tell 'em what you saw, Billy."
Billy,"But I'm so scared, McGarnigal."
MCGARNIGAL,"You gotta do this one for me, Billy. McGarnigal."
Billy,Okay. For you. McGarnigal.
Chief Wiggum,"Well, McGarnigal, Billy is dead. They slit his throat from ear to ear."
MCGARNIGAL,"Hey, I'm tryin' to eat lunch here!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Jump, Free Willy, jump! Jump with all your might!"
Mother,"Oh, no. Willie didn't make it. And he crushed our boy."
Man,"Ew, What a mess."
Homer Simpson,I don't like this new director's cut.
,
Homer Simpson,"Got it, Barn?"
Barney Gumble,Got what?
Barney Gumble,Ow!
Seymour Skinner,You're stealing a table?
Homer Simpson,I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a souvenir.
Seymour Skinner,Ah. Is that my necktie you're wearing?
Homer Simpson,Souvenir.
,
Bart Simpson,"Mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but I know he's innocent?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur used to have a saying, ""Shoot 'em all and let God sort 'em out."" Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. It took seventy-five Federal marshals to bring him down. Now, let's never speak of him again."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, Mom, Mom!"
Marge Simpson,Hmm?
Bart Simpson,What if I can get this guy off the hook. Sh-should I do it?
Marge Simpson,"Honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in your head, like a certain uncle did one grey December morn."
,
Judge Snyder,"Even though reopening a trial at this point is illegal and grossly unconstitutional, I just can't say no to kids."
Quimby's Lawyer,"So, young man. If Freddy Quimby didn't inflict these injuries on Mr. LaCoste, just who did?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened..."
Freddy,"Say it, Frenchie! Say chowder!"
French Waiter,Ne-verr!
Freddy,"Okay, you asked for it. I'm gonna enjoy this."
Bart Simpson,And that's what really happened.
French Waiter,I keel you! I am not a clumsy Clouseau-esque waiter. I will...
French Waiter,At least there were no big traps.
French Waiter,
Lionel Hutz,"How could you have seen all this, Bart? Weren't you supposed to be in school?"
Bart Simpson,I sorta skipped school.
Seymour Skinner,"I knew it! I knew you'd slip up sooner or later, Simpson."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,What slip up? What are you talking about? He confessed it.
Seymour Skinner,Quiet. I need this.
Judge Snyder,This court finds Freddy Quimby innocent of all charges. Case dismissed.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school."
Bart Simpson,"I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?"
Seymour Skinner,"I'm a small man in some ways, Bart. A small, petty man. Three months detention."
Seymour Skinner,"Wait a minute, Bart."
Seymour Skinner,Make that four months detention.
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was against me in that jury room. But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I prevailed. And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch."
Marge Simpson,"Good for you, Homie. You know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone."
Homer Simpson,"Great, Marge. I wanna hear all about it."
Marge Simpson,Give me those...
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,And those.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,And those!
Homer Simpson,
Krusty the Clown,
Sideshow Mel,"Please, Krusty, this is very demeaning."
Krusty the Clown,Shuddup and conduct!
Monkeys,
,
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Maggie, can you point to the monkey?"
Homer Simpson,Pfft. What do babies know?
Lisa Simpson,"Maggie, can you point to the credenza?"
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting Maggie's birthday cake."
Homer Simpson,What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.
Marge Simpson,"Hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! I made a special cake for you to ruin. It's over there."
Homer Simpson,Ooh.
Patty Bouvier,"Hello, everyone except Homer."
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Happy birthday, granddaughter!"
Patty Bouvier,"Marge, I think that's your father-in-law across the street."
Grampa Simpson,Hap-py Birthday!
Marge Simpson,Everybody get ready! Here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress!
Everyone,Aww!
Patty Bouvier,She's a little angel!
Selma Bouvier,Yeah. I wanna put a hook in her and hang her from our Christmas tree.
Grampa Simpson,Whaaaat smells?!
Marge Simpson,Uh-oh.
Bart Simpson,Shouldn't we wait for the other babies before we open the presents?
C. Montgomery Burns,Guess what happened to me last night!
Lisa Simpson,We didn't invite the other babies. Maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.
Marge Simpson,"Maggie, we have a surprise for you."
Maggie Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,Oo! Put some Lister's Carbolic Unguent on a wad of cotton. Put the cotton in her ear. That'll stop them shakes.
Jacqueline Bouvier,"No, no. What she needs is a Balsam Specific."
Grampa Simpson,"Balsam Specific? While we're burning money, why don't we give her a Curative Galvanic Belt, too?"
Bart Simpson,Don't forget to give her Smeckler's Powder!
Jacqueline Bouvier,Don't make fun.
Jacqueline Bouvier,I remember Lisa's third birthday. She and Bart did this adorable little song and dance routine.
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, that was a real horn-honker! Let's see it!"
Bart Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,Now! Do it!
Lisa Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,Do it!
Lisa Simpson,HOT DOGS / ARMOUR HOT DOGS...
Grampa Simpson,Sing it like you mean it!
Lisa Simpson,WHAT KINDS OF KIDS EAT ARMOUR HOT DOGS?
Bart Simpson,FAT KIDS...
Lisa Simpson,SKINNY KIDS...
Bart Simpson,KIDS WHO CLIMB ON ROCKS...
Lisa Simpson,TOUGH KIDS...
Bart Simpson,SISSY KIDS...
Milhouse Van Houten,EVEN KIDS WITH CHICKEN POX!
Everyone,LOVE HOT DOGS / ARRR-MOUR HOT DOGS THE DOGS KIDS LOVE TO BITE!
Lisa Simpson,Doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
Everyone,I FEEL LIKE CHICKEN TONIGHT! / LIKE CHICKEN TONIGHT! / LIKE CHICKEN TONIGHT!
Jacqueline Bouvier,It's been great spending time with my family again. I guess the next time I see you won't be until Thanksgiving.
Homer Simpson,"Or, if not then, Christmas."
Grampa Simpson,"I suppose I'll be gettin' home, too. At least I got Matlock to keep me company. Ooh! He's on in five minutes!"
Jacqueline Bouvier,He is?! Step on it!
Old Jewish Man,Hurry up! Hurry! Each Matlock could be our last!
Marge Simpson,"Homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely."
Homer Simpson,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny."
Marge Simpson,"Yeah. Anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. ""Periodicals,"" that's it."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, would you please stop reading that Ross Perot pamphlet?!"
Homer Simpson,Oh.
,
Marge Simpson,"Say! I've got a neat idea. Why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
Grampa Simpson,I'll be back in a jiffy.
Marge Simpson,That's not my mother.
Grampa Simpson,I'll be back in a jiffy.
Old Woman,"Can I come, too?"
Old Woman,
,
Marge Simpson,"You know, Mom, you and Abe have a lot in common. Umm, you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, it's not a swindle. What you do is, see, you give 'em all your credit card numbers, and if one of them is lucky, they'll send you a prize!"
Jacqueline Bouvier,I was just happy to talk to someone on the phone.
Grampa Simpson,"Aw, feelin' blue, eh? I got somethin' that'll cheer you up."
Lawyer,"Sir, I represent the estate of Charles Chaplin. I have a court order demanding an immediate halt to this unauthorized imitation. Boys?"
,
Jacqueline Bouvier,And here's a picture of me getting arrested for indecent exposure. It was the most embarrassing day of my life.
Grampa Simpson,Lamp those gams! You were one nifty number!
Jacqueline Bouvier,Boys all paid attention to me and it drove my friends crazy.
Grampa Simpson,Oh? Who were your friends?
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Oh, Zelda Fitzgerald... Frances Farmer... and little Sylvia Plath..."
Waylon Smithers,"I don't know, Sir. You had sex with that old woman?"
Grampa Simpson,"Y'know, you remind me of a poem I can't remember... and a song that may never have existed... and a place I'm not sure I've ever been to."
Jacqueline Bouvier,You're so sweet.
Grampa's Brain,"I feel all funny! I'm in love! No, wait, it's a stroke!"
,
Grampa Simpson,"No, wait. It is love!"
Grampa Simpson,I'm in looove!
,
Troy McClure,"Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such films as ""The Boatjacking of Super-Ship '79"" and ""Hydro: The Man with the Hydraulic Arms."" Coming up this hour on the Impulse Buying Network -- your chance to own a piece of Itchy and Scratchy, the Toontown twosome beloved by everyone, even cynical members of Generation X!"
,
Generation X Guy,"Yeah, ""groovy."""
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Troy, I'm proud to offer your viewers these hand-drawn Itchy and Scratchy animation cels. Each one is absolutely, positively one hundred percent guaranteed to increase in value!"
Announcer,Not a guarantee.
Bart Simpson,Ooh.
,
Bart Simpson,"Pardon me, sir. Forgive my clumsiness."
Homer Simpson,Not at all.
Bart Simpson,"Ah, yes, my name is Homer Simpson, and I'd like to order an Itchy an Scratchy cel. My credit card? Ah, do you accept the Federal Breast Inspector's card? License to Ogle? Viza?... Oh yes, of course, that's what I meant, Visa. It's these new dentures."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!"
Bart Simpson,He's damn opposed! Damn! Damn! Damn opposed!
Marge Simpson,"Bart! Homer, what possible reason could you have against Grampa being in love?"
Homer Simpson,"If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister! And then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!"
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Mom? Fine. You know, Abe had a very nice time with you last Sunday..."
Grampa Simpson,Tell her I love her!!!
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, sssh! I know my mother. If you come on too strong, she's going to get scared away."
Grampa Simpson,I love ya!
Jacqueline Bouvier,What?
Marge Simpson,"Uh... I love ya, Mom!"
Marge Simpson,I love ya! I love ya! I love ya!
Marge Simpson,"I love ya! I love ya! I love ya! I love ya, Mom! Gotta go!"
Man,"Yeah, hi! I got a special delivery for Homer Simpson."
Bart Simpson,That's me.
Man,Don't write no more letters to Mr. Sinatra.
Teenager,I've got a special delivery for Homer Simpson.
Bart Simpson,Um... that's me.
Teenager,Stop stealing golf balls from the driving range!
Wiseguy,"Homer Simpson? I've got a uh, ""special delivery"" for ya."
Bart Simpson,Go away!
Wiseguy,"If you do not open the door, Mr. Simpson, I cannot give you your ""special delivery."""
Delivery Man,Here's your special delivery.
Bart Simpson,Thanks.
Delivery Man,That's for keepin' me waitin'!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis, guess who's got a genuine Itchy and Scratchy animation cel?!"
,
Lisa Simpson,It looks like part of Scratchy's arm.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, no. I used Dad's credit card to buy this?"
Lisa Simpson,Yeesh. How much was it?
Bart Simpson,Three hundred fifty dollars.
Lisa Simpson,Oooh.
Nelson Apparition,Haw haw!
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Oh my God! This boy is having an out-of-body experience! This is very bad for business!
,
Grampa Simpson,Hot diggity! I'm gonna smooch her like a mule eatin' an apple! I even bought me some special novelty dentures.
Homer Simpson,"Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool."
Homer Simpson,"NOW, WHAT YOU GOTTA DO / IF YOU WANT TO GET A KISS / IS ACT REAL SMOOTH / AND MAKE YOUR MOVE LIKE THIS."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, I see. SO IF I TAKE YOUR ADVICE / AND MAKE YOUR PATENTED MOVE / THEN MY CHANCES FOR LOVE / WILL SLIGHTLY IMPROVE?"
Homer Simpson,NOW WHAT'S THAT RULE?
Grampa Simpson,PLAY IT COOOOL.
Grampa Simpson,
,
,
Bart Simpson,Is this cel worth anything?
Comic Book Guy,Let me show you something.
Comic Book Guy,"This, this is a Snagglepuss drawn by Hig Heisler. It is worth something. This, this is an arm drawn by nobody. It is worth nothing."
Bart Simpson,Can't you give me anything for it?
Comic Book Guy,I can give you this telephone. It is shaped like Mary Worth.
Comic Book Guy,No groaning in my store.
,
,
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Oh, my favorite song. This is so nice."
Grampa Simpson,I can't remember when I felt this young. I really can't.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Say, sport, mind if I have the next dance?"
Grampa Simpson,Don't sneak up on a...
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need for the blown gasket, Charlie! I'll have her back in one piece."
Grampa Simpson,"Grrr. That big ape thinks he can muscle in on my girl, does he? I'll show him. I'm gonna give him the frowning of a lifetime."
Jacqueline Bouvier,"I swear, Monty, you are the devil himself."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who told y-- ?! Yesss. Well, I'd say you were an angel, but angels don't dance like that."
Grampa Simpson,"Goodnight, Mrs. Bouvier... Wherever you are."
Lawyer,"Mr. Simpson, I represent the estate of Jimmy Durante. I have a court order demanding an immediate halt to this unauthorized imitation. Boys?"
Lawyer,Well would it be alright with you if I just laid down in the street and died?
Lawyer,Yes. That would be acceptable.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers...
C. Montgomery Burns,"She said ""no"" to me. Do you know how many women have said ""no"" to me? One hundred thirty. But only one since I've become a billionaire. And she's the one for me. I'm in love!"
Waylon Smithers,"Whoop-de-doo, Sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, whoop-de-doo! Whoop-de-doo to the world!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whooop de-doo, Mr. Florist! Whoop de-doo, Mr. Physical Trainer! Whoop-de-doo, Mr. President!"
Bill Clinton,I'm happy you finally found love.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whoop-de-doo, Tarantula Town!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Whoop-de-doo, employees! Everyone who's found true love may leave early today!"
Homer Simpson,All right!
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Memorandum to: Mrs. Bouvier. Re: Delineation of Romantic Intentions..."" Pfffft, too sappy. Smithers, come over here and help me write a mash note to my girlfriend!"
Waylon Smithers,"Fine. ""Darling One, Read my words and hear my heart speak of a love soft and undying. A love that will be with you always. Sincerely, yadda yadda yadda."""
C. Montgomery Burns,That's marvelous. How did you think of that so fast?
Waylon Smithers,"I sent it to you on your birthday. Excuse me, I have something in my eye."
,
Marge Simpson,Mom's almost ready for her date. She sure seems taken by this new beau. I feel so bad for Grampa.
Homer Simpson,"Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him."
Marge Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello! Why it's... it's uh... oh it's...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why it's Fred Flintstone and his lovely wife, Wilma! Oh, and this must be little Pebbles! Mind if I come in? I brought chocolates."
Homer Simpson,Yabba-dabba-doo!
Marge Simpson,"He's an awful, awful, awful man, but I guess if he makes Mom happy, that's all that really matters."
Homer Simpson,"That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys."
Bart Simpson,"Hi. You know, Gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me. She especially likes it when they give me money."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Run along, Pee-Wee. Baby gets nothing."
Bart Simpson,"Very well, you leave me no choice."
Bart Simpson,This gun is filled with ketchup. This one with mustard. Now give me three hundred fifty bucks or you're gonna be a mess for your date.
C. Montgomery Burns,You don't have the guts.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Aaagh! Here, take your money! Take it!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, the tables have turned, haven't they?"
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Monty, I'm ready."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, why'd she have to leave me?"
Jasper Beardly,"Hi, Abe. We heard you was in need of some cheerin' up, so we got you a special cake."
Voice Inside Cake,
Jasper Beardly,Uh-oh. Better call the nurse.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Bravissimo, Luigi. Bring us your finest bottle of vino."
Luigi,"Ay, you trust-a-Luigi, ah? He knows-a what for to make-a real nice the amorÃ©."
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Oh, Monty, I've never been to a more romantic restaurant."
Luigi,"Ay, Salvatore! Break out the cheap-a-hooch for Mr. No-Tip and the dried up-a zombie he's-a captured!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'm really sorry, but I charged three hundred fifty dollars on your credit card."
Homer Simpson,What?!
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, here's the cash."
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of ""Nightline""!"
Bart Simpson,But Dad...
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Bart Simpson,"Oh well, he's happy. I'm gonna keep this Mary Worth phone right here. Her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart. You wanna go play with that x-ray machine in the abandoned hospital?"
Bart Simpson,Sure!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, my dear, if you look in your champagne, I think you'll find a little surprise..."
Jacqueline Bouvier,Huh?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not to worry. I believe there's another one around here, somewhere."
C. Montgomery Burns,"My darling, since my kneecaps are filling with fluid as we speak, I'll be brief. Will you marry me?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Mom, you can't marry Mr. Burns! He's an evil man!"
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Evil-schmevil, Marge. Monty can provide for me, and besides, he's a great kisser."
Homer Simpson,Ew yuuuuck!
Marge Simpson,What about Abe Simpson? Don't you have any feelings for him?
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Ah, he's a dear, but he's too much of an old fusspot."
Marge Simpson,"We're all aware of Grampa's problems, but compared to Mr. Burns, he's Judge freaking Reinhold!"
Jacqueline Bouvier,I don't know who that is.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Aw, who needs her? Now I'll have more time to read things I find on the ground. ""Lay-tex Con-do..."" Boy, I'd like to live in one of those."
Grampa Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney, why don't you fill out the groom's side."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, down in front."
Kaiser Wilhelm Guy,Nein!
Lisa Simpson,Where's Grampa? Wasn't he invited?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the Gas Company in it."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"...and so, when Eliphaz came down from Mt. Hebron bearing figs, he offered them to Moham, who you will remember as the father of Shecham, and to Hazar on the occasion of their matrimony. Much in the same--"
C. Montgomery Burns,We've heard enough about Blizblaz and Himham already! Get to the bloody point!
Marge Simpson,Hm? Hm?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Do you, Charles Montgomery Burns, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I do.
C. Montgomery Burns,"The ring, you little imbecile! Before I really lose my temper!"
Jacqueline Bouvier,"I know, I know."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Oh, Monty! My favorite song. How did--"
C. Montgomery Burns,I specifically requested no romantic music!
Grampa Simpson,Mrs. Bouvier! Mrs. Bouvier!
Grampa Simpson,Mrs. Bouvier!
Grampa Simpson,"Honey, are ya sure ya wanna be Mrs. Montgomery Burns? Wouldn't ya rather be Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?"
Jacqueline Bouvier,No!
Grampa Simpson,
Jacqueline Bouvier,I don't want to be either.
Grampa Simpson,Hot ziggity zam! That's good enough for me!
,
Grampa Simpson,Turn off that racket!
Otto Mann,"Yeah, fat chance, pops."
Singers,HELLO GRAMPA MY OLD FRIEND / YOUR BUSY DAY IS AT AN END / YOUR EXPLOITS HAVE BEEN SAD AND BORING / THEY TELL A TALE THAT'S WORTH IGNOR-ING / WHEN YOU'RE ALONE / THE WORDS OF YOUR STORY WILL ECHO DOWN THE RESTROOM HALL / 'CAUSE NO ONE AT ALL / CAN STAND THE SOUND OF GRAM-PAAA....
Grampa Simpson,"I first took a fancy to Mrs. Bouvier because her raspy voice reminded me of my old Victrola. Oh, it was a fine machine. When the vulcanized rubber listening tube was just crammed in your ear. The tube would go in easier with some sort of lubricant like Linseed oil or Dr. Some..."
Grampa Simpson,I'm sorry.
,
Moe Szyslak,"All right, I raise a quarter."
Carl Carlson,I'm out.
Lenny Leonard,I'm out.
Barney Gumble,I'm out.
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, do you want any cards? Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"Whew. Don't try to eat these so-called ""chips."""
Lenny Leonard,Do you want another card or not?
Homer Simpson,Huh? Oh. Okay. I'll take three.
Homer Simpson,"I mean, woo hoo!"
Moe Szyslak,I'm in. Let's see your cards.
Homer Simpson,I was bluffing.
Moe Szyslak,"Come to papa... Wait a minute! You have a straight flush, Homer. Go! You do this every time. You... oh, you, ah, ... I'm choking on my own rage here."
Carl Carlson,"Hey, don't yell at Homer. Just because he's a little slow..."
Homer Simpson,How dare you call me that?!
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Homer, you still here? Boy, you are slow."
Lenny Leonard,Get the hell outta here.
,
Homer Simpson,"So, anyhoo, last night, we're playing poker, right. As usual, I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm uh... get this... ""A little slow."""
Homer Simpson,How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?
Bart Simpson,Buh.
Lisa Simpson,Sneh.
Maggie Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"We don't think you're slow. But, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything."
Homer Simpson,"You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge. They won't let me. One quality show after another. Each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. But they won't, they won't let me live!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow..."
Marge Simpson,"Oh Homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better."
Homer Simpson,Take another bath in malt liquor?
Marge Simpson,"... There's that. Or, you could take an adult education course."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine making course and I forgot how to drive?"
Marge Simpson,That's because you were drunk!
Homer Simpson,And how.
,
Patty Bouvier,"One way to drive your man wild is to wear tight, revealing clothes."
Class,Eww!
Patty Bouvier,"At this point, I'd like to remind you there are no refunds."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, here's the four one one, folks. Say some gangsta is dissin' your fly girl. You just give him one of these."
Lenny Leonard,See that ping sound means the spit was on target. Now you try.
Grampa Simpson,
Lenny Leonard,Gettin' better!
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him."
Homer Simpson,"That's it! If he can teach a class, he can teach a class. I mean, I can teach a class."
Administrator,What is your area of expertise?
Homer Simpson,"Well... I can tell the difference between butter and ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."""
Administrator,"No you can't, Mr. Simpson. No one can."
Homer Simpson,I've failed again. Everybody can teach a class but me. I'm an idiot. What am I gonna tell my wife and kids?
Administrator,"Oh, you're married?"
Homer Simpson,That depends. Is there another way to get this job?
Administrator,"No, Mr. Simpson, what I mean is, we may have a job for you after all. We need someone to teach a course on how to build a successful marriage."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. You've ruined a perfectly good jacket."
Homer Simpson,"Incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets."
Lisa Simpson,"I think it's great you're a teacher, Dad. So, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more Socratic method of interactive class participation?"
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Lisa. Daddy's a teacher."
,
Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, what a pleasant..."
Homer Simpson,"Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach."
Ned Flanders,But you rang my...
,
Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Can I take your order?
Homer Simpson,"Nothing for me, today! I've got a class to teach!"
SQUEAKY-VOICED TEENAGER,"Sir, it's a felony to tease the order box."
Homer Simpson,It's all right! I'm a teacher.
Miss Hoover,I didn't know we could do that!
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class."
Homer Simpson,"Down the hall, room twelve."
Man,Thank you.
Homer Simpson,"Ew. Okay, let's get started."
Homer Simpson,No talking.
,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. That'll eat up some time. Uh, how 'bout you, Otto."
Otto Mann,"My standards are just too high, you know. I feel like nobody's good enough for me."
Otto Mann,Whoa. You think you got 'em all but you forget about the eggs.
Lionel Hutz,"My problem is, I'm a real user of women. I move in right away and stay until the money's gone."
Edna Krabappel,"I'm a smart woman, but I make bad choices."
Edna Krabappel,Okay. Here's a set of house keys and my ATM card.
Waylon Smithers,"Um, I was married once, but uh, I just didn't know how to keep it together."
,
Smithers's Wife,"C'mon, Waylon. Make love to me the way you used to."
Waylon Smithers,No.
Smithers's Wife,"It's that horrible Mr. Burns, isn't it?"
Waylon Smithers,You leave Mr. Burns out of this! You!
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers!
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers!
Waylon Smithers,"Mr. Simpson, are you listening?"
Waylon Smithers,Simpson!
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Yeah, I was listening. Very funny."
Moe Szyslak,You were not! You were just eating a damn orange!
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange."
Homer Simpson,"First you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I don't understand.
Homer Simpson,Okay. But then we've got to get to work.
Groundskeeper Willie,"If I wanted to see a man eat an orange, I would have taken the orange eating class."
,
Hans Moleman,The eating of an orange is a lot like a good marriage...
Grampa Simpson,Just eat the damn oranges!
Carl's Wife,This is terrible.
Edna Krabappel,Unbelievable.
Groundskeeper Willie,Let's get out of here.
Seymour Skinner,He's a horrible excuse for an educator.
Homer Simpson,I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
Class,"In bed? / ""What wouldn't work?"""
Moe Szyslak,"So something wasn't working in bed, huh?"
Homer Simpson,"No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night we were fighting about money."
Seymour Skinner,"Ooh, a fight."
Moe Szyslak,"Trouble in paradise, huh? DERISIVE LAUGH)"
Homer Simpson,I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
Edna Krabappel,Marge dyes her hair?
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. She's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
Sideshow Mel,"C'mon, tell us more!"
,
Homer Simpson,I went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.
Chief Wiggum,"All right Simpson, you were warned about teasing the box."
Homer Simpson,
SQUEAKY-VOICED TEENAGER,Wait! I need closure on that anecdote.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Uh, Mrs. Simpson, it may interest you to know we are having a sale on blue dye number fifty-two. It is your hair color, I believe."
Marge Simpson,Whatever do you mean? I don't dye my hair...
Moe Szyslak,"Nah, nah, nah, you got it wrong, Pu. She's blue fifty-six."
Marge Simpson,I don't know what you're talking about.
Edna Krabappel,We just love your husband's class.
Marge Simpson,That's nice.
,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge. Let me in! There's crickets out here."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff."
Marge Simpson,Today at the Kwik-E-Mart everybody knew I dyed my hair.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say."
Marge Simpson,"Mm-hmm. I'm happy about that. But, I think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy."
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order. You're out of order. The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth. 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. Forget it, Marge - it's Chinatown."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again."
Homer Simpson,Yes ma'am.
,
Homer Simpson,"Now what is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary describes a wedding as: 'The process of removing weeds from one's garden.'"
Moe Szyslak,Tell us more about you and Marge.
Homer Simpson,"This is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things."
Carl's Wife,Guess he's run out of stories.
Seymour Skinner,What a rip off.
Otto Mann,I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course! What the heck was that lab fee for?
Homer Simpson,"No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds."
Everyone,"Oh, all right. / Okay."
Homer Simpson,"Now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow."
Edna Krabappel,We need names!
Homer Simpson,"Well let's just call 'em uh, ""Mr. X"" and ""Mrs. Y."" So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'"
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't you have to get to class?"
Homer Simpson,"Not tonight, Marge. Tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, well that will be..."
,
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,What the darn...?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you'll never guess what. My whole class is here. They're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives."
Sideshow Mel,Apparently that disturbing odor was the food.
Homer Simpson,"So, little Lisa, apple of my eye. How are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?"
Lisa Simpson,I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
Homer Simpson,And how's my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?
Bart Simpson,"Well, me and Milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer."
Homer Simpson,"Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do."
Bart Simpson,What the hell are you talkin' about? You're the one who double dared us.
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Bart Simpson,I'm outta here!
Lisa Simpson,Me too.
Homer Simpson,"Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed..."
Marge Simpson,I want this to end now!
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, why don't you just nibble her elbow. That always melts her butter, right?"
Marge Simpson,All right. Okay. Everybody out!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Ooh, she's gotta have it."
Marge Simpson,Get out! Get out! Get out!
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary."
Marge Simpson,"You, too."
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Marge Simpson,Get out!
Homer Simpson,But I'm not in the cla...
,
Otto Mann,Is any of this gonna be on the test? 'Cause I wasn't paying attention.
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives."
Marge Simpson,"You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you anymore."
Homer Simpson,"But, I learned my lesson. It'll never happen again."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, Homer, what's the big brouhaha? Ha."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing."
Homer Simpson,"Honey, the door blew shut! Oh. Fine. That's what you want? You got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road. Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I wind up in this crazy old world."
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now. And I don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, I've never seen Mom so mad at Homer before."
Lisa Simpson,"I'll tell you a secret, Bart. Every time I'm worried about Mom and Dad, I go to the attic and add to my ball of string."
,
Snowball II,
,
Bart Simpson,"Earth base, this is commander Bart McCool. We are under attack by the Zorrinid Brain Changers! Quickly, into the safety dome, Milbot!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Affirmative, humanoid."
Homer Simpson,"Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sorry, Bart, your dad kinda blew the fantasy. I only like it when I'm pretend scared."
Homer Simpson,"Keep up the rough-housing, son. Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. Oh, these stubborn grass stains."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Get a divorce.
Helen Lovejoy,Mm hm.
Marge Simpson,"But, isn't that a sin?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Mm Marge, just about everything is a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically, we're not allowed to go to the bathroom."
,
,
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Good night, Marge."
Homer Simpson,Why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture.

Marge Simpson,Funny... the way everything reminds me of Homer.
Homer Simpson,"I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together..."
Homer Simpson,Together?
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Here, Dad. I brought you some nice..."
Homer Simpson,"Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's just a plant."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you will respect your new mother. Now give her a kiss. Kisss herrr."
Homer Simpson,"OhmyGodohmyGodohmyGod. All right, let's get our stories straight. She tripped, right?"
Lisa Simpson,"Look, I brought you some nice pudding."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. There's a reason two people come together and stay together. There's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. If you want to get Mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can."
Homer Simpson,I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, thirty."
Lisa Simpson,"Good luck, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"All right, brain. It's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hi-hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so, um, I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies."
Marge Simpson,"Oh my. I'm very flattered, but I'm not really interested."
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, I come here, I get dressed up all nice-like, put my heart on the line and I make a fool of myself Oh boy, I'm gonna start bawling, here."
Marge Simpson,Why don't you come inside for a drink of water?
Moe Szyslak,'Kay.
Moe Szyslak,"Clean house, no silverfish... I coulda been very happy here."
Moe Szyslak,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what are you doing here?"
Moe Szyslak,"I uh, well... I never touched her, Homer. Homer, I swear, I never touched her."
Marge Simpson,"Here's your water, Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"I didn't ask her for no water. She's lying, Homer, she's lyin'. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I... I didn't do nothin'!"
Homer Simpson,"Bye, Moe!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what happened to you?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can."
Homer Simpson,A bouquet of po...
Homer Simpson,I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.
Homer Simpson,My tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, here, let me help you."
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's not a good thing."
Homer Simpson,"Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you."
Marge Simpson,"But, how do I know I can trust you?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again."
Marge Simpson,"I must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed."
,
,
,
Homer Simpson,It's great to be indoors with my family.
Lisa Simpson,"I'm really glad you're back, Dad. I knew you could do it. Now don't screw it up."
Bart Simpson,"Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an ""F""."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is dated two weeks ago."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, sorry. Here's a fresh one."
Marge Simpson,"And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight."
Homer Simpson,Special present?! I don't wanna wait! I want it now! I want the children to see. Oh. Right. Later.
Moe Szyslak,"So Marge, are you really happy, really?"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Moe!"

Bart Simpson,"Homer, my hat goes off to you."
Homer Simpson,"It's cool in here, boy. For the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. Although I must say, it's certainly refreshing."
Homer Simpson,I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.
Marge Simpson,Won't this overload the motor?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can you set the oven to cold?"

Lisa Simpson,Time's up?!
Bart Simpson,"So long, Lis. I'm gonna stow away underwater, and go where the pool goes. Have a good life."
Otto Mann,"Sorry, Bart-dude. We gotta fill this thing with Epsom salts and jam it on over to the old folks' home."
Bart Simpson,"Oh well. Same time tomorrow, Otto?"
Otto Mann,"No way, man. One day a summer is all we're budgeted for. I guess it is kind of a tease."
,
Lisa Simpson,Dad...
Lisa Simpson,Dad...
Lisa Simpson,Dad...
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, as you know, we've been swimming. And we've developed a taste for it. We both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. Now before you respond, you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of..."

Bart Simpson,But you're wearing your glasses.

Bart Simpson,"What fun can you have in a pool, anyway, that you can't have in a bathtub with a garbage bag taped around your cast?"
Bart Simpson,"Traitors. Go on and have your pool. I'm fine by myself, right here."
Bart Simpson,"You know, this isn't so bad. I'll just spend the summer getting better acquainted with an old friend called Television."

RAVI,Shankar.
Krusty the Clown,"Shankar. Groovy, man."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Uh, uh, noo. This can't be what it looks like. There's gotta be some other explanation."
Ned Flanders,I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isn't. I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!
Bart Simpson,Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.
Ned Flanders,I'm a murdiddly-erdiler.

Nelson Muntz,"Look, Lisa. I found this change on the bottom of the pool. You can have it."
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks, Nelson."
Ralph Wiggum,Somebody took my juice money.
English Boy,"Lisa, please join my family for a weekend in the country. There'll be hunting, charades , and ever so many delightful romantic misunderstandings."

Lisa Simpson,"Shut up, brain! I got friends now. I don't need you anymore. Duh, yeah, I'd love to go to your house."

Bart Simpson,Sure. That was twenty minutes ago.
Grampa Simpson,Gonna be in the tub for awhile.

Bart Simpson,You can start makin' it up to me right now. Flanders is leaving the house. I want you to sneak in there and bring me back some evidence... and something sweet for later.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I'm here for you but, I'm not gonna break into somebody's house."
Bart Simpson,"All right. You're right, you're right. Let's-let's just forget about that. Let me read to you from my play. ""Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga? Is it St. Swivens day already?"" ""'Tis,"" replied Aunt Helga."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm goin', I'm goin!"
Bart Simpson,A human head!
Bart Simpson,"Of course. Oh no. He's back. Flanders is back! Lisa, get outta there!"
Bart Simpson,"No, Lisa, don't go upstairs. You'll be trapped!"
Bart Simpson,"An axe! He's got an axe. I'll save you, Lisa!"
Bart Simpson,Uh... I'll save you by calling the police.
Ned Flanders,
Homer Simpson,"You see, Marge? You see?"
Police Dept. Machine,"Hello and welcome to the Springfield Police Department Resc-U-Fone. If you know the name of the felony being committed, press one. To choose from a list of felonies, press two. If you are being murdered or are calling from a rotary phone, please stay on the line."

Bart Simpson,I came to stop you from murdering Lisa like you murdered your wife.
Ned Flanders,Murdered?
,
Maude Flanders,"Murdered? Oh no, I've just been in the country for a week."
Bart Simpson,But I distinctly heard you say that Maude was with God.
Maude Flanders,"Oh, that's right. I was at Bible camp. I was learning how to be more judgmental."
Bart Simpson,"But I saw the murder, and then I saw you bury the corpse in the backyard."
Ned Flanders,"All right. It's true. I am a murderer. I over-watered Maude's favorite ficus plant, I panicked, and then I buried the remains. I was hoping to replace it before you got home."
Bart Simpson,But I heard a woman scream.
Ned Flanders,"Huh? Well, now that I can't explain."
Lou,"We found it, chief."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, well I guess that explains everything."
Homer Simpson,Not everything. There's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
Maude Flanders,"Um, I'm right here."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I see. Then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic."
,

Miss Hoover,"Ralph, this better not be about your cat."
Miss Hoover,"Oh, aLl right, Li..."
Allison,Columbus was looking for a passage to India.
Miss Hoover,"Correct, Allison! And on your very first day in our class!"
Allison,"And during a subsequent voyage, Columbus found what is now the continent of South America."
Miss Hoover,Yow-wee.
Lisa Simpson,I never made Miss Hoover yow-wee.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Allison? I'm Lisa Simpson. Oh, it's great to finally meet someone who converses above the normal eight-year-old-level."
Allison,"Actually, I'm seven. I was just skipped ahead because I was getting bored with the first grade."
Lisa Simpson,"You're younger than me, too?"
Allison,Are you hyperventilating?
Lisa Simpson,"No. I just like to smell my lunch... Gee, I never met anyone who skipped a grade before."
Allison,I'm surprised you haven't been skipped. You're obviously smart enough.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm sure I could have, but I'd hate to leave behind all my wonderful friends."
Girl #1,"Out of the way, brain queen."

Homer Simpson,Jackknifed sugar truck. Sugar?
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, buddy. Here's a quarter. Call for help at the nearest phone... I'll keep an eye on things here."
Hans Moleman,If only this sugar were as sweet as you sir.
Bart Simpson,"Homer, that was downright decent of you."
Homer Simpson,"We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, isn't this stealing?"
Homer Simpson,"Read your town charter, boy. ""If food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot."" Since I don't see him around, start shoveling."
,
Marge Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Mom.
Marge Simpson,What! What?
Lisa Simpson,Why am I still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead?
Marge Simpson,"I don't know, honey. I guess that's the school's decision to make."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school? Make a few calls on my behalf? Maybe you could've been ""nicer"" to Principal Skinner, if you know what I mean."
Marge Simpson,Lisa! I am nice.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I really appreciate you making dinner, but this food tastes a little strange."
Lisa Simpson,It hurts my teeth.
Homer Simpson,"That's because I've loaded it with sugar!!... Marge, our ship has come in! I found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that I'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. And all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound."
Marge Simpson,But the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
Lisa Simpson,And it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
Homer Simpson,"Those are prizes. Ooo, a blasting cap!"

Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh no, not again."
Lisa Simpson,"I need help, Mom. There's another girl at school who's smarter, younger, and a better sax player than me. Oh I feel so average."
Marge Simpson,"Well, you'll always be number one to me..."
Bart Simpson,Hell-o. First born within earshot.
Marge Simpson,"Uh... I meant, my number one girl."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, for Chri..."
Marge Simpson,"Honey, if you get too competitive you'll never be happy. No matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you. I always thought I had the tallest hair. But that trip to Graceland really opened my eyes."
Lisa Simpson,But she's better than me at everything that makes me special.
Marge Simpson,"Believe me, honey. She's more scared of you than you are of her."
Lisa Simpson,"You're thinking of bears, Mom."

Lisa Simpson,"Ah, that used to be my face in the mud..."
Bart Simpson,"I can't stand to see you so miserable, Lis, unless it's from a rubber spider down your dress. Hmmm. That gives me an idea."
Bart Simpson,Note for later. Put rubber spider down Lisa's dress.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I know... How about if I dig up some dirt on Allison? Remember how I got Milhouse's picture on America's Most Wanted?"
Fbi #1,There he is on the monkey bars.
Fbi #2,Try to take him alive.
Lisa Simpson,"I appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body."
Bart Simpson,"Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's my card."
Lisa Simpson,I don't need a card. You live in the room next to me.
Bart Simpson,Note: Next year order fewer cards.
,
Homer Simpson,And you didn't think I'd make any money. I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus.
Marge Simpson,"While you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. The plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in Monday."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! A four day weekend!

Lisa Simpson,Why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
Bart Simpson,"Lis, I did some checkin' on this Allison character and I know it's against all your moral fibers..."
,
Bart Simpson,"Yep, she's clean as a bean. But, I did tip off the Feds as to the whereabouts of our good friend, Milhouse."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"I'm telling you, I didn't do anything."
Agent,I don't care.
Milhouse Van Houten,My glasses!
Lisa Simpson,"I've got to stop being so petty. I should be Allison's friend, not her competitor. I mean, she is a wonderful person."
Bart Simpson,"Way to go, Lis. I mean, why compete with someone who's just gonna kick your butt anyway?"
Lisa Simpson,I prefer my phrasing.
,
Allison,"It's great of you to come over, Lisa. I really want us to be friends."
Lisa Simpson,You're a wonderful person.
Englishman,Goodbye.
Professor Taylor,"Hi, Lisa. I'm Allison's father, Professor Taylor. I've heard great things about you."
Lisa Simpson,Oh really? I...
Professor Taylor,Don't be modest. I'm glad we have someone who can join us in our anagram games.
Allison,We take proper names and rearrange the letters to form a description of that person.
Professor Taylor,"Like, oh, I dunno, Alec Guiness."
Allison,Genuine class.
Professor Taylor,"Very good. All right, Lisa. Jeremy Irons."
Lisa Simpson,Jeremy's Iron.
Professor Taylor,"Uh huh. Well, that's very good for a first try. You know, I have a ball. Perhaps you'd like to bounce it."
,
Lisa Simpson,What's this?
Allison,"Oh, it's for the school diorama competition."
Lisa Simpson,You're finished already? But the competition isn't for weeks.
Allison,"Lisa, we're talking dioramas, who could wait? I chose the ""The Telltale Heart,"" by Edgar Allan Poe. See, this is the bedroom where the old man was murdered. And he's buried here, under the floorboards. And look, I used an old metronome to simulate the heartbeat that drove the killer insane. Neat, huh?"
Lisa Simpson,It's great. It's really great.
Professor Taylor,"Oh! Got away from you, huh? Well you keep at it."
,
Homer Simpson,Must... protect... sugar... Thieves everywhere... The strong must protect the sweet... the sweet
Marge Simpson,Homer?
Homer Simpson,"In America, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Homer!"
Homer Simpson,"Huh, wha?"
Marge Simpson,I want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. You're being completely paranoid.
Homer Simpson,"Oh am I, Am I really?"
Homer Simpson,A-ha!
Englishman,Hello.
Homer Simpson,"All right, pal. Where'd you get the sugar for that tea?"
Englishman,I nicked it when you let your guard down for that split second. And I'd do it again.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?"
Homer Simpson,"Never! Never, Marge! I can't live the buttoned-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. Oh, I'll never be the darling of the so called ""City Fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this Homer Simpson."
Marge Simpson,"Look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?"
Homer Simpson,No!
Homer Simpson,Hey! Get off my sugar! Bad bees! Bad!
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Ow! Oh, they're defending themselves somehow!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Look, Bart. It almost killed me, but I hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from Oliver Twist. And now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm."
Bart Simpson,Uh oh!
Lisa Simpson,Is it okay?!
Bart Simpson,"Well, the important thing is that we survived."
Lisa Simpson,Oh who am I kidding? There's no way I'm ever gonna beat Allison!
Bart Simpson,"Well sure there is... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the French say, ""Bartesque."""
Lisa Simpson,I'll do whatever it takes.
Bart Simpson,"Then welcome to the nether regions of the soul. Now here's what we do. Tomorrow morning when Allison comes out of her house, we spray her with the hose, soaking her from head to toe, leaving us relatively dry."
Lisa Simpson,Relatively?
Bart Simpson,"Well, there's bound to be some splashback."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition."
Bart Simpson,"Well, we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in front of the students and faculty."
Lisa Simpson,Perfect!
Bart Simpson,Leaving her primed for the most traumatic hose-soaking of her life.
Lisa Simpson,Enough with the hose!
,
Beekeeper #1,Sure is quiet in here today.
Beekeeper #2,"Yes, a little too quiet, if you know what I mean."
Beekeeper #1,"Hm, I'm afraid I don't."
Beekeeper #2,"You see, bees usually make a lot of noise. No noise suggests no bees."
Beekeeper #1,"Hm, I understand now."
Beekeeper #1,"Oh look, there goes one!"
Beekeeper #2,To the Beemobile!
Beekeeper #1,You mean your chevy?
Beekeeper #2,Yes.
,
Beekeeper #1,"Ah, very clever, Simpson. Luring our bees to your sugar pile and then selling them back to us at an inflated price."
Homer Simpson,"Bees are on the what, now?"
Beekeeper #2,"Simpson, you diobolical... we're willing to pay you two thousand dollars for the swarm."
Homer Simpson,Deal!
Beekeeper #1,"Oh, wait a minute. The bees are leaving."
Homer Simpson,Nooooooo! My sugar is melting! Melting! Oh what a world!
Englishman,
Homer Simpson,Oh sugar!
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Homie."
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. I've learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is too much for one man. It's clear now why God portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in Hawaii."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, Diorama-rama. My favorite school event next to Hearing Test Thursday."
Miss Hoover,The Grapes of Wrath? I don't get it.
Nelson Muntz,Here's the grapes. And here's the wrath!!
Nelson Muntz,"Haw, haw!"
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, yes. Very good wrath. Ah, let's see, our foreign exchange student, Uter, has chosen ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Eh... But this is just an empty box!"
Ãœter,I begged you to look at mine first! I begged you!
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, here is as the French say, ""le fake diorama."" I'll create a diversion and you make the switch."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, everybody, whoa, look at me. I'm over here. Turn this way right now."
Sherry,"Hey, it's Bart!"
Milhouse Van Houten,And he's doin' stuff.
Various Kids,Fascinating! Wow! Can't take my eyes off him...etc.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here!"
Bart Simpson,
Miss Hoover,"Okay, our next entry is, ""The Telltale Heart"" from Allison Taylor."
Seymour Skinner,"Mm, I can't wait to see this. Be ready with the ribbon."
Children,Eew!
Miss Hoover,What is it?
Bart Simpson,It's a cow's heart. They're trying to make a monkey outta you!
Seymour Skinner,"Allison, is this supposed to be some kind of joke?!"
Allison,I didn't do that! I made a different one!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh is that so, young lady? Well, where is this phantom diorama?"
Allison,"Well, I don't know."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, at least have the guts to take the blame, girl. You're only compounding your folly by lying about it."
Bart Simpson,Right on!
Seymour Skinner,"Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the classroom. Well, maybe in an older student's biology classroom, but that's none of my business. Elementary school is where I wound up and it's too late to do anything about that. Frankly, I'm starting to regret skipping you ahead."
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"It's the beating of that hideous heart! I mean, I think I hear something."
Lisa Simpson,"Why, here's Allison's real diorama. It got misplaced, ...or so it would seem."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, well, that changes everything. Let's have a look. Get the ribbon ready."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh. A little sterile... no real insight. What do you think, Miss Hoover?"
Miss Hoover,Eh.
Seymour Skinner,"This has been a very disappointing day. All right, on to Lisa Simpson."
Bart Simpson,"You're a shoo-in now, Lis."
Lisa Simpson,"After the way I've behaved, I don't deserve to win."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, this doesn't deserve to win."
Lisa Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,Like what?
Seymour Skinner,"Oh noW, we're into the dregs. Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry."
Seymour Skinner,"Prepackaged ""Star Wars"" characters still in their display box?! Are those the limited edition action figures?"
Ralph Wiggum,What's a diorama?
Seymour Skinner,"Why, it's Luke, and Obie-Wan... and my favorite, Chewie. They're all here! What do you think?"
Miss Hoover,I think it's lunchtime.
Seymour Skinner,We have a winner!
,
Lisa Simpson,"I'm really sorry about what I did, Allison. It's no shame being second to you."
Allison,"Thank you, Lisa. You know, I'm actually kinda glad I lost. Now I know losing isn't the end of the world. Hey, you still think we can be friends?"
Lisa Simpson,Only if we're the best.
Ralph Wiggum,"I beat the smart kids, I beat the smart kids..."
Ralph Wiggum,I bent my Wookies!
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Ralph. Want to come with me and Allison to play anagrams?"
Allison,We take proper names and rearrange the letters to form a description of that person.
Ralph Wiggum,My cat's breath smells like cat food.
,
Marge Simpson,"This romance is so full of heartfelt passion. I can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. Homer. Are you awake? This is important, give me some sign you're awake."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Wake up!
Homer Simpson,Huh? Wuzz wrong? House run away? Dog's on fire?
Marge Simpson,"Homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives?"
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Wake up!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!"
Marge Simpson,It's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in Maggie's kiddy pool.
Homer Simpson,"There you are. Thought you could get away, huh?"
Marge Simpson,I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
Bart Simpson,"You mean ""shining."""
Marge Simpson,"Homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book."
Homer Simpson,Hmmm.
Marge Simpson,I knew I shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
Bart Simpson,It's a new episode.
Lisa Simpson,"Not exactly. They pieced it together from old shows, and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth."
Bart Simpson,Really?
Lisa Simpson,Ren and Stimpy do it all the time.
Marge Simpson,"Yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about Ren and Stimpy? Children, your father and I have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. It's time to learn about love."
Bart Simpson,"No need, Mom. We already learned in school."
,
Bart Simpson,Bo-ring.
Kids,Ew!
Edna Krabappel,She's faking it.
,
Marge Simpson,I mean romance not love.
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, romance is dead. It was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney. Homogenized, then sold off piece by piece."
Marge Simpson,That's not true. Romance is all around us. In our neighborhoods...
Marge Simpson,Even on our jobs...
Marge Simpson,All you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.
Bart Simpson,Hmmm.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, is Al there?"
Moe Szyslak,Al?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Al. Last name Caholic."
Moe Szyslak,"Lemme check. Phone call for Al, Al Caholic. / Uh, Jacques Strap! / Is I Pee Freely here? / Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Uh, Homer Sexual / My Crotch / A Amanda Huggenkiss? / A Huge Ass / ""Ivanna Tinkle"" / I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, no. No, ask your heart what its fondest desire is."
Homer Simpson,Hm...
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, Chocolate... / Mmmm, invisible cola. / Mmmm, Forbidden donut. / Mmmm sacrilicious. Mmmm, / Mmmm, free goo. Mmmm, something."
Marge Simpson,"No, think about people. About moments in your life that have been very romantic."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay."
Marge Simpson,"That's not the idea at all. Okay, well this story isn't ideal, I've never told it to you before."
Marge Simpson,I got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless.
Marge Simpson,"So I actually went to the bowling alley to spite him, or her..."
Marge Simpson,Oh!
Marge Simpson,I'm awfully sorry.
Jacques,Entirely my fault. It is nice to meet you... ... Homer.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge."
Marge Simpson,
Jacques,"Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They are far too tapered for the ball you are using. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball."
Marge Simpson,"No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... ... Brunswick."
Jacques,Call me Jacques.
Marge Simpson,Jacques.
Jacques,Marge.
Marge Simpson,Hmmm.
Jacques,May I ask you a bold question?
Marge Simpson,Sure.
Jacques,You've never bowled before?
Marge Simpson,Never.
Jacques,No?
Marge Simpson,No.
Jacques,Then I will teach you.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I don't want to trouble you."
Jacques,"Not at all. I am a professional. Roll the ball for me, Marge. Let me see your form."
Marge Simpson,All right. But I'm not very good.
Jacques,"I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up."
Marge Simpson,Oh!
Jacques,"Now, throw!"
Marge Simpson,But...
Jacques,"Throw, damn you!"
Marge Simpson,You're a very good teacher!
,
Jacques,Here we are.
Marge Simpson,You didn't have to drop me off.
Jacques,But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman."
Jacques,"I know, I know. My mind says stop, but my heart and my hips cry proceed."
Marge Simpson,
Jacques,"Marge, darling, I-I want to see you tomorrow. Meet me tomorrow for brunch."
Marge Simpson,What's brunch?
Jacques,"You'd love it. It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end. You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal."
Jacques,Here we are.
Marge Simpson,You didn't have to drop me off.
Jacques,But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
,
Marge Simpson,He seemed to know a lot about brunch. But it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.
Marge Simpson,
Jacques,"Your laughter is like music to me. But if you laugh at what I say next I will die, for I am about to say something very serious... perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again."
Marge Simpson,That doesn't shock me.
Jacques,"Away from prying eyes. At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace."
Jacques,"Marge, speak to me."
Marge Simpson,Is Thursday okay?
Jacques,It's okay indeed.
,
Marge Simpson,Thank goodness I drove down an ironic street.
Marge Simpson,"I made the right decision to stay with my Homie, and there was no harm done. So if you kind of mentally snip out the part where I already had a husband, that's my idea of romance."
Lisa Simpson,Happy Valentine's.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want you to stop seeing this Jacque. You can let him down gently. But over the next couple of months, I want you to break it off."
Marge Simpson,"Okay, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that was a close one, kids."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge. As long as we're traumatizing the kids, I have a scandalous story of my own."
Waylon Smithers,"Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet your new co-worker, Mindy Simmons. I think she has a degree in engineering or something."
Mindy,Hi. How's it goin'?
Lenny Leonard,Pleased to meet ya.
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, ditto."
Homer Simpson,Hi.
Cherub Lenny,"Homer, what's the matter?"
Cherub Carl,Ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
Homer Simpson,Gotta go.
,
Homer Simpson,I made it the whole day without seeing her again.
,
Homer Simpson,I mean hello!
Mindy,I guess we'll be goin' down together. I mean getting off togeth-- I mean...
Homer Simpson,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator."
Homer Simpson,That's unsexy.
Homer Simpson,Ew.
Homer Simpson,"Well, this is my floor."
Homer Simpson,See you tomorrow....
Homer Simpson,"I tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in Capital City together..."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it."
Mindy,"Homer, I got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
Mindy,"No, Homer. Let's do it. Let's call room service!"
Homer Simpson,Oh!
,
Waylon Smithers,"Someone is charging room service to the company, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Well we'll just see about that.
C. Montgomery Burns,Fly my pretties! Fly!
C. Montgomery Burns,Continue the research.
,
,
Passerby #1,"Thanks for poisoning the planet, bastard!"
Mindy,Get bent!
Passerby #2,No more Chernobyls!
Homer Simpson,Go to hell!
Homer Simpson,I was doing my best to resist her...
Homer Simpson,"But at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom."
,
,
Mindy,"This was a really nice night, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah."
Mindy,What's wrong?
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.
Mindy,"Oh... well, we don't have to."
Homer Simpson,Yes we do. The cookie told me so.
Mindy,"Well, desserts aren't always right."
Homer Simpson,But they're so sweet.
Mindy,"Homer, you know how I feel. So it-it's up to you. Look in your heart. I think you'll see what you want."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, baby."
Marge Simpson,"This was a wonderful idea, Homie."
Bart Simpson,What happened to Mindy?
Marge Simpson,"Yes, what did happen to her?"
Homer Simpson,She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
Marge Simpson,Good. Does anyone else have a love story?
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, I do. And just like your love stories, it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings and scars that will never heal."
Lisa Simpson,It started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on Valentine's Day...
Ralph Wiggum,
Lisa Simpson,Poor Ralph.
Lisa Simpson,"Here you go, Ralph."
Ralph Wiggum,You choo choo choose me?
Lisa Simpson,"It was an unusually warm February 14th, so the children walked home without jackets."
,
Ralph Wiggum,Can I walk you home... valentine?
Lisa Simpson,"Sure, I guess."
Ralph Wiggum,That valentine sure was funny.
Lisa Simpson,Glad you liked it.
Ralph Wiggum,"It says, ""choo choo choooose me,"" and there's a picture of a train."
Lisa Simpson,Yeah. Nice gag.
Ralph Wiggum,Uh. So... Do you like... stuff?
,
Ralph Wiggum,The doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, here's my house."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, a Malibu Stacy Convertible! ""Look in the tunk."" He must mean trunk."
Lisa Simpson,Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show!
,
Announcer,It's the Krusty the Clown 29th Anniversary Show!
Krusty the Clown,"Hey! Thank you, thank you."
Ralph Wiggum,"Lisa, you want a bite of my ice cream?"
Lisa Simpson,"No, thanks."
Chief Wiggum,"Send it this way, boy."
Ralph Wiggum,Whoops.
Lisa Simpson,Aw.
Chief Wiggum,Aw. Nothing gets chocolate out. See?
Krusty the Clown,"Now, for my favorite part of the show: Whazzat say? Talk to the audience!? Oh, God, this is always death. All right."
Lisa Simpson,Oh no. Please don't show me with Ralph.
Krusty the Clown,"What's your name, son?"
Ralph Wiggum,Ralph.
Lisa Simpson,
Krusty the Clown,"And is this your girlfriend, Ralph?"
Ralph Wiggum,Yes! I love Lisa Simpson and when I grow up I'm going to marry her.
Lisa Simpson,Noooo!!
Lisa Simpson,"Now you listen to me -- I don't like you. I never liked you, and the only reason I gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would!"
,
Ashley,
Bart Simpson,"Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half."
Bart Simpson,"A-a-a-a-and, now."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, not all romances turn out that way. Bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?"
,
Bart Simpson,"Yes, I do. The only girl I ever loved invited me up to the treehouse. She had something very important to tell me."
Laura Powers,"I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone. I have a boyfriend."
Laura Powers,You won't be needing this.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Wait, that did end in heartbreak. Thanks for opening up old wounds, you ma."
,
Marge Simpson,"Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say: ""There's a whole lotta frowning going on."""
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, doesn't any love story have a happy ending?"
Marge Simpson,Of course. Remember when... Your Aunt Selma got married?
Selma Bouvier,"Hmm, uh, good..."
Sideshow Bob,Soon I will kill you.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, wait, wait, that's no good. I know, your grandfather."
Marge Simpson,It all started on an outing for dinner...
,
Marge Simpson,"Say! I've got a neat idea. Why don't you go in and pick up my mother, and we'll all go out to dinner."
Grampa Simpson,I'll be back in a jiffy.
Marge Simpson,That's not my mother.
Grampa Simpson,I'll be back in a jiffy.
Old Woman,"Can I come, too?"
Old Woman,
Marge Simpson,They hit it off right away. But there were rivals for the fair lady's hand...
,
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Oh, my favorite song. This is so nice."
Grampa Simpson,I can't remember when I felt this young. I really can't.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Say, sport, mind if I have the next dance?"
Grampa Simpson,Don't sneak up on a...
C. Montgomery Burns,"No need for the blown gasket, Charlie! I'll have her back in one piece."
Marge Simpson,"But in the end, just when things looked worse, true love triumphed."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Oh, Monty! My favorite song. How did--"
C. Montgomery Burns,I specifically requested no romantic music! What!
Grampa Simpson,Mrs. Bouvier! Mrs. Bouvier!
Grampa Simpson,Mrs. Bouvier!
Grampa Simpson,"Honey, are ya sure ya wanna be Mrs. Montgomery Burns? Wouldn't ya rather be Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?"
Jacqueline Bouvier,No!
Grampa Simpson,
Jacqueline Bouvier,I don't want to be either.
Grampa Simpson,Hot ziggity zam! That's good enough for me!
,
,
Lisa Simpson,That didn't seem like a happy ending.
Lisa Simpson,That seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation.
Marge Simpson,I give up. Did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
Bart Simpson,I learned it screws everybody up.
Marge Simpson,"There's that side of it. But there's also... help me out here, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Sorry, Mom. I've decided to save my love for someone who is guaranteed not to reject me."
Lisa Simpson,"Soon, Corey, soon."
Marge Simpson,"Well, kids, I tried. Maybe you're right."
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Marge. Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe I'm no expert on the subject. But there was one time I got it right..."
,
Marge Simpson,"Gee, Artie. Artie wait. I don't know. I mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it."
Artie Ziff,Just kiss...
Marge Simpson,"Artie, please!"
Artie Ziff,"Come on, kiss me."
Marge Simpson,"No, oh, Artie!"
Artie Ziff,"Please, please."
Marge Simpson,"Now, really, I mean it. Now stop it!"
Artie Ziff,"I'm sorry, Marge."
Marge Simpson,"Take me home, Artie."
,
Artie Ziff,"Marge, I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anybody about my busy hands. Not so much for myself, but I am so respected it would damage the town to hear it. Good night."
Marge Simpson,"Yeah, right."
,
Homer Simpson,Shut up. I'm over as far as I can go!
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right! I'll walk in the mud!"
Marge Simpson,Homer.
Homer Simpson,Marge?
Marge Simpson,"Yeah, you want a ride?"
Homer Simpson,Sure.
Marge Simpson,"You know Homer, when I got home, I realized who I should have gone to the prom with."
Homer Simpson,Who? Oh.
Marge Simpson,My prom date.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, pour vous."
Marge Simpson,Why so glum?
Homer Simpson,"I've got a problem. Once you stop this car, I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then I'll never be able to let you go."
Lisa Simpson,"Ah, your first kiss."
Homer Simpson,But not the last.
Marge Simpson,"Mmmm, Homie..."
Marge Simpson,"See kids, that's what I meant by romance."
,
Itchy,"Thanks, kids. Now we'd like to speak to you seriously for a moment."
Scratchy,Yep. This week is the grand opening of Itchy and Scratchy Land. The violentest place on earth.
Itchy,"And to celebrate, for this week only, we're cutting ticket prices in half."
Krusty the Clown,"Kids, you heard the cartoon rat. If you haven't already run to your parents begging to go, do it now. You won't be missing anything funny. I'll just be sitting here reading this grown-up's newspaper."
Krusty the Clown,Go now!
Lisa Simpson,Dad! Remember how you said that going to Itchy and Scratchy Land would be too damned expensive?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybody's a sinner except for this guy."
Bart Simpson,"But now Itchy & Scratchy Land is cutting ticket prices in half. Can we go, Dad? Can we can we can we, take it, Lis."
Lisa Simpson,Can we?
Lisa Simpson,Yayyyyyy!
,
Homer Simpson,No no no no no no no no no. Ask your mother.
Lisa Simpson,Yayyy!
,
Bart Simpson,Mom! Guess what!
Lisa Simpson,We're going to Itchy and Scratchy Land!
Marge Simpson,"No, I've already planned our vacation. We're going to the Highway 9 Bird Sanctuary. I understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year."
Marge Simpson,It's shaped like a diner. And it's on this really tall pole.
,
Lisa Simpson,Mom! Dad! Bart's dead!
Bart Simpson,"That's right, dead serious about going to Itchy and Scratchy Land."
Lisa Simpson,"You know, Itchy and Scratchy Land isn't just for kids. They have a place called Parents Island."
Marge Simpson,Hmm?
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah. ""Dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."""
Homer Simpson,TV Town! Hammock Land!
Marge Simpson,Oooh. Recipe-related bumper cars.
Lisa Simpson,Yayyyy!
Marge Simpson,"Now wait a minute. I'm not sure about this. Every time we've ever gone on vacation, I end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. You have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time."
Homer Simpson,Embarrassed? What are you talking about?
Marge Simpson,"Well, there was our trip to the Amish Country..."
Homer Simpson,Oh yes.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look Marge! They're still not fightin' back! I can be a jerk and no one can stop me! Hee hee hee hee!"
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Even worse was our trip to Sandy Beach.
,
Homer Simpson,Suckers.
Homer Simpson,Shark-boy!
Marge Simpson,This year I want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so we'll have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation.
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Mom. We'll make you proud of us."
Homer Simpson,"Lobster hat... Fishnet Speedo, Jr... Wheelie Shoes... invisible dog leash. Well, I'm packed."
,
Marge Simpson,"...and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to Santa's Little Helper. Do you want me to write any of this down?"
Grampa Simpson,"No! I ain't senile, dad-blast it!"
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, bye-bye / Bye / Bye, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,Wait a minute. What was that last thing you said? Grampa's Little Helper? What's that?
Grampa Simpson,Which one of you is the mailman?
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families."
Bart Simpson,Agreed.
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the Interstate. Fasten your seatbelts, kids. We're on our way to Itchy and Scratchy Land!"
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I've got an ace up my sleeve."
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, can we stop at Flickey's?"
Homer Simpson,No.
,
,
Homer Simpson,Omigod! What'll I do? What'll I do?
Marge Simpson,"What's the matter with you, Homer? We don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car."
Homer Simpson,"The whole trunk's full of 'em, Marge."
Teenager,Got any fruits or vegetables?
Homer Simpson,
,
Teenager,"Hey, Mr. Wimbly, it happened again."
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio."
Radio Preacher,The Book of Revelations tells us to watch for the Seven Signs of Evil...
2nd Radio Preacher,Sign of Evil number four...
3rd Radio Preacher,Continuing our Sign of Evil countdown... here's Vanessa Williams.
,
Lisa Simpson,Haven't we stood in five different states long enough?
Homer Simpson,No.
,
Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do.
Marge Simpson,We'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
Homer Simpson,"We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all."
,
,
Bart Simpson,Whew. I'm glad that wasn't us.
,
Homer Simpson,"North. ""South."" Nuts to this! I'm going to take a shortcut."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, no. You're going to get lost."
Homer Simpson,"Trust me, Marge. With today's modern cars you can't get lost. What with all the silicon chips and such."
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, we're here. Let us never speak of the shortcut again."
,
Homer Simpson,"Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot."
,
Pilot,"We're now approaching our final destination: Itchy and Scratchy Land, the amusement park of the future, where nothing can possi-blygo wrong."
Pilot,"Possibly go wrong. Uh, that's the first thing that's ever gone wrong."
,
,
Homer Simpson,One adult and four children.
Cashier,Would you like to buy some Itchy and Scratchy Money?
Homer Simpson,What's that?
Cashier,"It's money that's made just for the park. It works just like regular money, but it's um, fun."
Bart Simpson,"Do it, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Well, okay. If it's fun. Let's see..."
Homer Simpson,I'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.
,
Homer Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,Cool! / Neat-o!
Marge Simpson,Such a violent motif.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children."
Lisa Simpson,Ow!
Bart Simpson,Ow!
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, please. It was just a figure of speech."
Engineer,"There's no need to murmur, ma'am. Here at Itchy and Scratchy Land, we're just as concerned about violence as you are. That's why we're always careful to show the consequences of deadly mayhem so that we may educate as well as horrify."
Marge Simpson,"When do you show the consequences? On TV, that mouse pulled out that cat's lungs and played them like a bagpipe. But in the next scene, the cat was breathing comfortably."
Engineer,Just like in real life. Hey look over there!
,
Bart Simpson,"I'll have the brain burger with extra pus, please."
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Homer Simpson,Eyeball stew.
Marge Simpson,Homer! We just got here and already I'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior.
Bart Simpson,"I was just ordering a cheeseburger, Mom. They have violent names for everything here."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I see. All right. I'll have the baby guts."
Waiter #1,"Lady, you disgust me."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, that's veal."
Marge Simpson,Oh.
,
Marge Simpson,You're sure she'll have fun here?
Childcare Worker,"Oh, of course. Babies love the ball room."
,
Marge Simpson,"Tortureland, Explosion Land, Searing Gas Pain Land, Unnecessary Surgery Land..."
Homer Simpson,Oh look! It's the twelve noon robot parade! Hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
Bart Simpson,"Wow, this is so much like my dreams it's scary."
Lisa Simpson,"Awww, look at that cute little baby axe."
Marge Simpson,"It's cute, but I'm sure it's very sharp, and probably dirty."
Engineer,"Dirty, maybe... dangerous, hardly. These are the latest state-of-the-art animatronic robots. They have sensors that ensure they only attack each other, never the guests."
Marge Simpson,"See all that stuff in there, Homer? That's why your robot never worked."
Marge Simpson,This is just what I was hoping for. Spending the day together as a family.
Marge Simpson,"Ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals."
Homer Simpson,Parents Island?
Marge Simpson,Yuh-huh. I'm sure we'll appreciate each other all the more when we meet up at dinner. Are you kids gonna be alright?
Marge Simpson,Kids?
,
,
Homer Simpson,It is the '70s! Right down to the smallest detail!
Marge Simpson,"Hey, the bartender even looks like John Travolta."
Bartender,Yeah. Looks like.
,
Bart Simpson,"Look at all this great stuff, Lis. Cool, personalized plates."
Bart Simpson,"Barclay, Barry, Bert, Bort?! Aw, c'mon, Bort?"
Little Kid,"Mommy, mommy, buy me a license plate!"
Mother #1,"No. Come along, Bort."
Man,Are you talking to me?
Mother #1,No. My son is also named Bort.
Lisa Simpson,Who are all these characters?
Bart Simpson,"Well you're probably too young to remember the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy and Friends Hour. They had to come up with some friends. There's Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Klu Klux Clam..."
Lisa Simpson,Oh yeah. They weren't very funny.
Bart Simpson,"I don't know, Disgruntled Goat had his moments."
,
Announcer,"Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's, where it's constantly New Years Eve. Here we go again - three, two, one..."
Marge Simpson,It must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over.
Waiter #2,Please kill me.
Lisa Simpson,
Scratchy,
Childcare Worker,The babies look unhappy.
Childcare Supervisor,Add more balls.
Narrator,"Roger Meyers Sr., the gentle genius behind Itchy and Scratchy, loved and cared about almost all the peoples of the world. And he in return was beloved by the world, except in 1938 when he was criticized for his controversial cartoon ""Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors."""
,
Homer Simpson,Thank you!
Narrator,"Among his proudest achievements was the full length musical, ""Scratchtasia."""
,
,
Cletus Spuckler,"Hey Maw, I'm gonna get me a picture of this crazy critter."
Engineer,"No flash photography, please."
Narrator,"Roger Meyers' next full length feature was the wildly successful, ""PinItchio""."
Scratchy,"Now you be a good, PinItchio, and don't you lie."
Pinitchio,I promise I will never hurt you.
Scratchy,Ouch!
Lisa Simpson,I wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?
Bart Simpson,Wanna get a snow cone?
Lisa Simpson,Okay.
Bart Simpson,"So, Mr. Itchy. You think you're God's gift to women, do ya?"
Lisa Simpson,"Don't do it, Bart."
Itchy,I just wanted to entertain!
Bart Simpson,Can you believe I keep gettin' away with this... Officer?
,
Technician #1,"Mop and bucket man to the exit of the ""Nauseator."""
Technician #2,We have another jumper on the roof of T.G.I. McSCRATCHY'S.
Technician #3,"We need more ""Bort"" license plates in the gift shop. I repeat, we are sold out of ""Bort"" license plates."
,
Technician,I really wish they wouldn't scream.
Bart Simpson,Dad?
Homer Simpson,I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the butt.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah. There's just no way to resist it, is there?"
,
Marge Simpson,"I want all five T-shirts to say, ""Best vacation ever."""
Loud Speaker,"Attention, Marge Simpson. Your son has been arrested."
Marge Simpson,
Woman,I'd be terribly embarrassed if I were that boy's mother.
Loud Speaker,"Attention, Marge Simpson. We've also arrested your older, balder, fatter son."
,
Marge Simpson,I'm so embarrassed. I wish there was a hole I could just crawl into and die.
Policeman,"Okay, throw her in the hole."
Marge Simpson,"Stay away from me, Homer!"
Professor Jonathan Frink,You've got to listen to me. Elementary chaos theory tells us that all robots will eventually turn against their masters and run amok in an orgy of blood and kicking and the biting with the metal teeth and the hurting and shoving.
Scientist,"How much time do we have, Professor?"
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Well according to my calculations, the robots won't go berserk for at least twenty-four hours."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Uh, I forgot to uh, carry the one."
,
Marge Simpson,I have nothing to say to you.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I was a political prisoner."
Marge Simpson,How were you a political prisoner?
Homer Simpson,I kicked a giant mouse in the butt. Do I have to draw you a diagram?
Marge Simpson,"Oh for gosh sakes, what now?"
Homer Simpson,"Hey look, this one's coming on to me."
Homer Simpson,"Yoo hoo, Mr. Robot..."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't contradict your elders."
Homer Simpson,My hair! You chopped off my hair! Oh God I'm ugly!
Marge Simpson,I knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary.
,
Hans Moleman,"I need the biggest seed bell you have. No, that's too big."
,
Bart Simpson,"A chopper, we're saved!"
Employee,"Hey, you're the guys who didn't like our capering. When you get to hell, tell 'em Itchy sent ya."
Marge Simpson,"Oh my, it looks like we're doomed!"
Homer Simpson,Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits."
Homer Simpson,"What're you, the narrator?"
Lisa Simpson,Just keep taking pictures.
Bart Simpson,I'll get more cameras!
Bart Simpson,"Smashie, smashie."
Marge Simpson,I don't approve of that.
Bart Simpson,Sideshow Bob! I'm only ten and I already got two mortal enemies.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, mouse! Say cheese. Hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero."
Homer Simpson,"Die, bad robots, die! With a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero."
Bart Simpson,Who would've thought that our visit to Itchy and Scratchy Land would turn out to be our best vacation ever.
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, best ever."
Marge Simpson,"Are you two bonkers? We almost got killed, not to mention all the embarrassment I suffered."
Lisa Simpson,"But Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. It brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories."
Marge Simpson,"You know, you're right. This truly was the best vacation ever. Now, let us never speak of it again."
,
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner of the park, I'd like to thank you for stopping the killer robots. And to show my appreciation, here are two free passes."
Homer Simpson,But there are five of us.
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Here are two free passes.
Homer Simpson,That's better.
Technician #4,"Man, if this is happening here, I-I hate to think what's happening in Euro Itchy and Scratchy Land."
,
French Ticket Taker,"Hello! Itchy and Scratchy land open for business. Who are you to resist it, huh? C'mon! My last paycheck bounced. My children need wine!"
,
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"I hope you realize now that violence on TV may be funny, but it's not so funny when that violence is happening to you."
Bart Simpson,But it would be funny to someone who was watching us.
Marge Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"No, Mom. He's right. Observe."
Bart Simpson,Ow!
Marge Simpson,"Oh my. Lisa, go to your room."

Jingle Singers,"NO SPORTS, NO ROCK, NO INFORMATION / FOR MINDLESS CHATTER, WE'RE YOUR STATION!"

Radio Announcer,"KBBL Talk Radio. And now, Springfield's favorite conservative, and author of the well-selling book ""Only Turkeys Have Left Wings,"" ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow!"
,
Carl Carlson,Ugh. That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot! He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity. Can you believe that?!
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, switch the station. I consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable."
Homer Simpson,"Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. Now, I'm not very political -- I usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this Birch Barlow really speaks to me..."
,
Birch Barlow,"Good morning, fellow freedom-likers. Birch Barlow, the fourth branch of government, the fifty-first state. You know, there are three things we're never gonna get rid of here in Springfield. One: the bats in the Public Library..."
,
Birch Barlow,Two: Mrs. McFearly's compost heap.
,
Birch Barlow,"And three: our six-term mayor, the illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking Spend-o-crat -- Diamond Joe Quimby!"
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Hey, I am no longer illiterate."
,
Birch Barlow,"Now why are we doomed to this Quimby quagmire, you ask, o reasonable listener? Because this town is under the stranglehold of a few tie-dyed tree huggers who would rather play hackey-sack than lock up the homeless."
,
Marge Simpson,"This sounds awfully controversial. Lisa, you know I don't like controversy in this house."
Lisa Simpson,"I don't like him either Mom, but I'm doing a report on local politics for my school project."
Bart Simpson,"You think you're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects. Well, um... I'm doing a school project on, uh, fireworks!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that."
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,...and uh this proposed expressway will bring increased commerce to our local merchants.
Old People,
Seymour Skinner,"Now, as a special send-off and a way to say ""Gung hay fat choy"" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has promised us a fireworks display!"
Bart Simpson,
Chinese Principal #1,All week he promise big firework display!
Chinese Principal #2,Bad student.
Chinese Principal #1,Bad principal.
,
Birch Barlow,"...so my friends, let's just junk those Dumb-o-crats and their bleeding heart smell-fare program!"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I had to listen to this jerk all morning. Can we listen to something else?"
Homer Simpson,"When I'm driving the car, I get to choose the radio station. When you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station."
Homer Simpson,I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back.
Birch Barlow,"Alright my friends, now let's go to the phones. First up is Bob, from South Springfield. Welcome to you, sir."
Sideshow Bob,"Hello, Birch. Long-time listener, first-time caller. Kudos for bringing the ""public"" back to the Re""public""an party! It's high time people realized we conservatives aren't all Johnny Hate-mongers and Charlie Bible-thumps, or even -- God forbid -- George Bushes!"
Lisa Simpson,That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
Homer Simpson,"Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob. Yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who Sideshow Bob is."
Homer Simpson,Phew.
Lisa Simpson,"Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Clown's sidekick. But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail."
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Lisa Simpson,"When he got out, he married Aunt Selma and tried to murder her."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Sideshow Bob."
,
Lisa Simpson,Bart! Your mortal enemy is on the radio!
Dr. Demento,It's time for more deeee-mentia with Dr. Demento!
Bart Simpson,
DR. DEMEMTO,"And now the ""Funny Five..."""
Lisa Simpson,"I meant your other mortal enemy, Sideshow Bob."
Grampa Simpson,What's in it for us?
Jasper Beardly,"Yeah, give us something we like, or we'll ride ya out of town on a rail!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well uh, what do you, er, people like?"
Jasper Beardly,Sleep.
Old Jewish Man,"Sexy dames, and plenty of 'em!"
Grampa Simpson,Matlock!!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well, uh, I suppose I could name it the uh, ""Matlock Expressway."""
,
Sideshow Bob,...but it would be terribly myopic of me to blame all my current woes on one spikey-haired little simpleton.
Birch Barlow,"Mm hm. Myopic, or to say the least, intransigent. Now, you mentioned some ""woes"" there..."
Sideshow Bob,"Well -- you see, Birch, I'm presently incarcerated."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Convicted of a crime I didn't even commit. ""Attempted"" murder. Now, honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for ""Attempted"" Chemistry? Do they --"
Sideshow Bob,"Oh really, now! This is a personal call!"
Birch Barlow,"Now, m-m-my Friends, isn't this just typical? Another intelligent conservative here railroaded by our liberal justice system -- just like Colonel Oliver North, Officer Stacey Koon, and cartoon smokesperson Joe Camel. Well, I've had it!!"
,
Birch Barlow,I am gonna make it my mission to see that our friend Bob is set free!
Bart Simpson,Nooooo!!
Edna Krabappel,"Well, despite Bart's objections, the people of South Africa can now vote in free Democratic elections."
Birch Barlow,"My friends, Bob is a political prisoner. I want every loyal listener to do everything they can to get him out of jail!"
Moe Szyslak,"All right, you heard the man. One grenade each."
Barney Gumble,"Moe, I think he meant through non-violent grass-roots political action."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, geez... really ya think so? All right, give 'em back. Come on, everybody give 'em back."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, who pulled the pin on this one?"
,
Protesters,Free Bob! Free Bob!
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Very well. If that is the way the winds are blowing, let no one say I don't also blow."

Mayor Joe Quimby,"By special order of the Mayor of Springfield, you are hereby granted a full and complete pardon. Congratulations, Robert Onderdonk Terwilliger."
Guard,Boat's on the other side.
Sideshow Bob,Yes! Thank you!

C. Montgomery Burns,"Hail, brothers! Quoronon cillairia ozu mahoq!"
Others,Mahoq! Mahoq!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, then. Gentlemen, the mayoral campaign is upon us and if we hope to defeat this Joe Quimby we need a candidate with name recognition and media savvy. A true leader who will do exactly as he's told."
Birch Barlow,"Monty, I'm way ahead of you. If you'll just open that door you'll see the next mayor of Springfield."
The Rich Texan,Whu'd it say?
Birch Barlow,"No, no. Bob! Bob, come in!"
Sideshow Bob,"A fine ""Mahoq"" to you all."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Why, he's even better."
Rainier Wolfcastle,I agree. I like the human touch.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Now, students, I want you to be on your best behavior for this carefully-choreographed media event. Now this means there is to be no wising-off, no face-making, and no grass-eating. This means you, Ralph."
Ralph Wiggum,"Yes, sir."
Sideshow Bob,"Hello, children. Hello, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Eep.
Sideshow Bob,"Young friends, my opponent Joe Quimby is confused about your school system. Do you know what he does? He flip-flops."
Sideshow Bob,Sometimes he doesn't know whether he's coming or going.
Sideshow Bob,He wants to sell your future short!
Sideshow Bob,"Hmm. Bart, we can't let Bob steal the spotlight. We're gonna have to stoop to the lowest common denominator."
Bart Simpson,I can do that.
Mayor Joe Quimby,Ack! Help! I'm being attacked by uh things!
Homer Simpson,"It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!"
Lisa Simpson,Uncle Mayor was just saying that us kids are the most important natural resource we have!
Kent Brockman,More important than coal?
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Er, uh, er yes."

Lisa Simpson,"This time, he's the lesser of two evils."
Jimbo Jones,"Uh, yeah, yeah. I love Grimby. Uh, could I have some more bumper stickers, please dude?"
Jimbo Jones,All right! The mummy's ready for his mystical journey!
Milhouse Van Houten,What's haaappening?!
,
Grampa Simpson,"That Quimby fella promised to build us a Matlock Expressway! How you gonna top that, smart guy?"
Sideshow Bob,"Hmm. Oh how's this? I'll not only build the Expressway, I will spend the remainder of this afternoon patiently listening to your interminable anecdotes."
Old People,

Sideshow Bob,
Scary Announcer,"Mayor Quimby supports revolving-door prisons. Mayor Quimby even released Sideshow Bob, a man twice convicted of attempted murder. Can you trust a man like Mayor Quimby? Vote Sideshow Bob for Mayor."

Larry King,
Mayor Joe Quimby,I shouldn't have shaken hands with those old people.
Lisa Simpson,I hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.
Bart Simpson,Don't worry. He's taken a million of these capsules.
Bart Simpson,
,
Birch Barlow,"Sideshow Bob: Councilman Les Wynan says that you're not experienced enough to be mayor. Sir, what do you have to say about that?"
Sideshow Bob,I'd say that Les Wynan ought to do more thinkin' and less whinin'!
Lisa Simpson,There's no Councilman Les Wynan.
Bart Simpson,"Good line, though."
Birch Barlow,"Mayor Quimby, you are well-known, sir, for your lenient stance on crime. But suppose for a second that your house was ransacked by thugs, your family tied up in the basement with socks in their mouths. You try to open the door -- but there's too much blood on the knob--"
Mayor Joe Quimby,What is your question?
Birch Barlow,"My question is about the budget, sir..."
Mayor Joe Quimby,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. I don't agree with his Bart-killing policy, but I do approve of his Selma-killing policy."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, he framed me for armed robbery, but man, I'm achin' for that upper-class tax cut."
,
Everyone,Shh!
Kent Brockman,And the results are in. For Sideshow Bob -- one hundred per cent. For Joe Quimby -- one per cent. And we remind you there is a one per cent margin of error.
Everyone,
Kent Brockman,"All right let's go, live, to Bob Headquarters now, for Mayor Terwilliger's victory speech."
Sideshow Bob,
Kent Brockman,And just look how happy he is!
Sideshow Bob,
Sideshow Bob,"So sorry, Mr. Simpson. Your house is blocking construction of our new Matlock Expressway."
Sideshow Bob,"Now, I am a fair man. You will have seventy-two hours to vacate. At that time, we will blow up your house and any remaining Simpsons."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we've got to stop them."
Homer Simpson,"I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!"
Grampa Simpson,"Move your god darned house, Son!"
,
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going to be left back."
Bart Simpson,You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade?
Seymour Skinner,"Well, yes... but, not for four or five years. Bart, you're going to kindergarten."
Bart Simpson,Kindergarten?
Edna Krabappel,Ha!
Kindergarten Teacher,"Now boys and girls, who knows what this is?"
Bart Simpson,Triangle.
Kindergarten Teacher,"Very good, Bart. You have first choice of toys for free play."
Bart Simpson,Cool! I call the Flintstone Phone!
FRED FLINTSTONE,Yabba dabba doo! I like talking to you!
Bart Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,We're gonna lose our house and end up living under a bridge like common trolls.
Lisa Simpson,I don't think Bob won that election legally. I can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
,
Clerk,Here you go. The results of last month's mayoral election. All forty-eight thousand voters and who each one of them voted for.
Lisa Simpson,I thought this was a secret ballot.
Clerk,Meh.
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, Aaron A. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Aaron L. Aaronson voted for... Bob. Arthur B. Ablabab voted for... Bob."
Lisa Simpson,Hey!
,
Bart Simpson,So whoever it is who wrote that note wants to meet us here tonight?
Lisa Simpson,"This is so cool, Bart. We're just like Woodward and Bernstein!"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics."
Homer Simpson,Stuck-up Riverdale punks. Think they're too good for me.
Shadowy Figure,You're on the right track. Follow the names.
Bart Simpson,How the hell do you know?
Shadowy Figure,"I can't tell you who I am, but I worked on the campaign."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Mr. Smithers!"
Waylon Smithers,"Well, you might as well give me a ride home now!"
,
Waylon Smithers,"I've never gone behind Mr. Burns' back before, but Sideshow Bob's ultra-conservative views conflict with my, choice of lifestyle."
Waylon Smithers,All I can do is give you one name. Edgar Neubauer. Find him and you'll find your answer.
Lisa Simpson,No Edgar Neubauer.
,
Lisa Simpson,This is hopeless. They're gonna demolish our house for sure. We're gonna have to move into a Motel 6.
Bart Simpson,But dad can't afford six dollars a night.
Bart Simpson,Heyyy...
Bart Simpson,Lis! Lis! C'mere! I found him! I found Edgar Neubauer!
Bart Simpson,Oh my God! The dead have risen and they're voting Republican!
Lisa Simpson,"No, Bart, don't you see? Dead people can't vote!"
Lisa Simpson,"Look! Prudence Goodwyfe, died 1641. She voted for Bob, too! So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Bopper!"
,
Lisa Simpson,Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob! Look! Mr. and Mrs. Bananas! Humphrey Boa-gart!
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, my poor dead kitty! Please, not you too!"
Lisa Simpson,"All right, Bob! Now it's personal!!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, uh, he did try to kill me..."
,
,
Lionel Hutz,"Mr. Mayor, is it true you rigged the election?"
Sideshow Bob,"No, I did not."
Lionel Hutz,"Kids, help."
Edna Krabappel,Ha!
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, I don't mind. We want these children to feel justice has been served. That way, they can sleep soundly tonight on their hard, feculent motel pillows. Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am."
Lisa Simpson,I have a plan. I think we can trap him.
Lisa Simpson,"You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're innocent..."
Sideshow Bob,Indeed I am.
Lisa Simpson,"Because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius Springfield has ever known -- Birchibald T. Barlow!"
Birch Barlow,
Lisa Simpson,"You don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?"
Bart Simpson,You were just Barlow's lackey!
Lisa Simpson,You were Ronnie to his Nancy!
Bart Simpson,Sonny to his Cher!
Lisa Simpson,Ringo to his rest of the Beatles!
Sideshow Bob,"Enough! Lies, lies, lies! I did it! I did it all!"
Spectators,
Sideshow Bob,"There! Is that what you want, you smarmy little bastards?!"
Bart Simpson,We want the truth!
Sideshow Bob,"You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! No truth-handler, you! Bah! I deride your truth-handling abilities!"
Judge Snyder,Would you get to the point?
Sideshow Bob,"Yes. Only I could have executed such a masterpiece of electoral fraud. And I have the records to prove it! Here, just look at these! Each one a work of Machiavellian art!"
Judge Snyder,But why?
Sideshow Bob,"Because you need me, Springfield! Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside, you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! That's why I did this -- to protect you from yourselves! Now, if you don't mind, I have a city to run."
Judge Snyder,Bailiffs! Place the Mayor under arrest!
Sideshow Bob,"What? Oh, yes. All that stuff I did..."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart! We did it! Now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!"
Groundskeeper Willie,"Boy, you read my thoughts! You've got the ""shinning."""
Bart Simpson,Aww. Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with.
Lisa Simpson,"The spoon, Bart."
Bart Simpson,Of course!

Sideshow Bob,"Someday, I'll have my vengeance. Someday, when I find my way out of this savage, roach-ridden cesspool..."

Homer Simpson,"Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house?"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again."
Marge Simpson,"When you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door?"
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Oh no! We left Grampa back at the gas station.
Lisa Simpson,What about Grampa?
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hello. ""We're here."" ""Hi."" etc."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh goody, the Sea Monkeys I ordered have arrived. Look at them cavort and caper."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, they're the new winter caretakers for the lodge."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, they work hard and they play hard."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five John Denver Christmas Specials."
Homer Simpson,John Denver.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, that's odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I found a short cut through your hedgemaze."
Groundskeeper Willie,
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE'S BRAIN,"Now, now. Go easy on the wee one. His father's gonna go crazy and chop them all into haggis."
Bart Simpson,What's haggis?
Groundskeeper Willie,"Shhh! You wanna' get sued? Now look, boy. If your Da' goes ga-ga, you just use that ""shin"" of yours to call me and I'll come a-runnin'. But don't be readin' my mind between four and five. That's Willie's time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply, I can ensure an honest winter's work out of those low-lifes."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, did you ever stop to think that maybe it was doing this that caused the previous caretakers to go insane and murder their families?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, perhaps. Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hm, cable's out... Think I'll have a beer."
Homer Simpson,"Hm, not a drop in the house. What do you know?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'm impressed. You're taking this quite well."
Homer Simpson,I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sorry. Don't worry, there's plenty I can do to keep myself occupied. Maybe I'll check out that axe collection. See ya later."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, is Dad gonna kill us?"
Marge Simpson,We're just gonna have to wait and see.
,
Moe Szyslak,"So what'll it be, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,Moe! Give me a beer!
Moe Szyslak,No. Not unless you kill your family.
Homer Simpson,Why should I kill my family?
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, they'd be much happier as ghosts."
Homer Simpson,You don't look so happy.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. See? Now waste your family and I'll give you a beer!"
,
Marge Simpson,Homer! Homie? Hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness.
Marge Simpson,"Feelin' fine, well, that's a relief."
Marge Simpson,This is less encouraging.
Homer Simpson,"So, what do you think, Marge? All I need is a title. I was thinking along the lines of ""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something something."
Marge Simpson,Go crazy?
Homer Simpson,"Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!"
Homer Simpson,Heh-heh. Scaredy-cat...
Homer Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"You stay here 'til you're no longer insane. Mmmm, chili would be good tonight."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, it's Moe. Ah, look, some of the ghouls and I are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward."
Homer Simpson,Can't murder now. Eating.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, for cryin' out loud."
Moe Szyslak,C'mon.
Homer Simpson,Noooo!
,
Homer Simpson,Heeeeere's Johnny.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Daaaa-vid Lettermaaaan!
Grampa Simpson,"Hi David, I'm Grampa."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer. And I'm Ed Bradley. All this and Andy Rooney tonight on ""60 minutes."""
Marge Simpson,"Hello, police? This is Marge Simpson. My husband is on a murderous rampage. Over."
,
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, well thank God that's over. I was worried there for a second."
,
Marge Simpson,No answer.
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Mom. I can use my ""shinning"" to call Willie."
,
Kent Brockman,And that was the first time she'd ever flown a plane.
Groundskeeper Willie,Uh oh. The little fat boy an' his family're in trouble.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,I'm comin' to rescue the lot o' ya.
Groundskeeper Willie,"All right, looney! Show me what ya got."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Heh, is that the best you can do?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh my, I hope that rug was Scotchguarded."
Homer Simpson,Must kill family. .
Kent Brockman,"...have been given rifles, but no ammunition. Reportedly there was a hardware store along the..."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, look!"
Homer Simpson,"Television! Teacher, mother, secret lover."
Homer Simpson,"Urge to kill fading, fading..."
Homer Simpson,Fading... Rising!
Homer Simpson,"...Fading, fading, gone."
Homer Simpson,"Come, family, sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow."
,
Announcer,"Live from Broadway, it's the Tony Awards! With your hosts, Tyne Daly and Hal Linden."
Bart Simpson,"Homer, change channel!"
Homer Simpson,Can't. Frozen.
Chorus,One!...
Lisa Simpson,
Chorus,ONE / SINGULAR SENSATION...
Homer Simpson,Urge to kill rising.
,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy."
Lisa Simpson,Dad!! Your hand is jammed in the toaster!!
Marge Simpson,Dad!! Daaadd!! Homer!!
Homer Simpson,Get it off! Get it off! Get it offf!!
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's in there again!"
,
Homer Simpson,"This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools."
,
,
Homer Simpson,There! Better than new! Now to take her for a test toast.
Homer Simpson,What the-?
,
Homer Simpson,Look at that! I'm the first non- Brazilian person to travel backwards through time!
Mr. Peabody,"Correction, Homer, you're the second."
Sherman,"That's right, Mr. Peabody."
Mr. Peabody,"Quiet, you."
,
Homer Simpson,I've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. OK. Don't panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...
Grampa Simpson,"If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything, because even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you can't imagine."
,
Homer Simpson,"Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future."
Homer Simpson,Stupid bug. You go squish now.
Homer Simpson,"But that was just one little insignificant mosquito. That can't change the future, right? Right?"
Sloth,
,
Homer Simpson,Phew. I'm back.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my loving family. Nothing's changed."
Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, slave-a-reenos."
Lisa Simpson,Okilly dokilly.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I see by the big board we've got a Negative Nellie in Sector Two. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask the whole family to kinda freeze and prepare for re-Neducation."
Bart Simpson,"Don't you remember, Dad? Flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world."
Homer Simpson,
,
,
,
Ned Flanders,"Okay, everybody. Let's see some big smiles."
Ned Flanders,"Just relax, let the hooks do their work."
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you smiling at?
,
Ned Flanders,"Now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
Moe Szyslak,"It's not so bad, Homer. They go in through your nose. And they let you keep the piece of brain they cut out."
Moe Szyslak,"Look. Oooo, hello. Hello there. Who's that big man there? Who's da?"
Bart Simpson,"Join us, Father."
Marge Simpson,It's Bliiiiisssss.
Homer Simpson,Nooooo!
Homer Simpson,"Oh no! They're gaining on me. Wait, I have an idea."
Homer Simpson,These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape.
,
Homer Simpson,I gotta go back... Fix future...
,
Homer Simpson,This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.
Homer Simpson,Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wish I wish I hadn't killed that fish."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where is everybody?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, there's a bug that looks like dad. Let's kill it."
Lisa Simpson,Okay.
,
Homer Simpson,This is gonna cost me.
,
Homer Simpson,"I mean, Heeeyy."
Bart Simpson,"Good morning, father dear. Hope you're well."
Lisa Simpson,Are we taking the new Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut?"
Marge Simpson,Donut? What's a donut?
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Hmph. It's raining again.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"You're still not in your own world, Homer. I can get you home, but you have to do exactly as I tell..."
Maggie Simpson,This is indeed a disturbing universe.
,
Homer Simpson,Don't touch anything?!! I'll... touch... whatever... I... feel like!!
Homer Simpson,
,
Kang,Foolish earthling. Totally unprepared for the effects of time travel.
Kang,"What happened to us, Kodos?"
Kodos,Quiet you.
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Good morning, dear."
Homer Simpson,"What's my name?! What color is the sky?! What of donuts? WHAT?! For the love of God, tell meeeee!!!"
Marge Simpson,Homer! The sky is blue. Donuts are plentiful. Friday is TGIF night on ABC. What's gotten into you?
Homer Simpson,Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's just eat.
Homer Simpson,Eh. Close enough.
,
,
Bart Simpson,Hey everybody! Let's all turn our desks backwards before Mrs. Krabappel shows up!
Class,Yeah / Cool / Great idea/ etc.
,
Bart Simpson,Eh?
Edna Krabappel,"Alright, backwards boy. Back your butt down to detention."
Seymour Skinner,"Over here, Simpson! The detention room is dangerously overcrowded, so you'll be serving your time in the cafeteria."
Kid Behind Glass,Oxygen running out...
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, you should have thought of that before you made that paper airplane."
,
Seymour Skinner,This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical. It's a powder keg waiting to go off in an explosion of unacceptable behavior.
Lunchlady Doris,"Don't bitch to me, boss man. Thanks to the latest budget cuts, I'm down to using grade F meat."
,
Seymour Skinner,Wouldn't it be wonderful if there were some sort of common solution to both our problems?
Lunchlady Doris,That would be great!
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, Bart, watch this."
Lunchlady Doris,Drats.
Jimbo Jones,Oh no! My favorite outfit!
Seymour Skinner,"Jimbo, this is by far the worst..."
Seymour Skinner,Hmmm.
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm. Uh, Jimbo, why don't you ""assist"" Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen."
Jimbo Jones,"Bite me, Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,Well might we.
,
Jimbo Jones,It's hard for me to clean this giant pot when you keep spilling meat tenderizer all over me.
Jimbo Jones,"Oh great, now I gotta work in the dark."
,
Edna Krabappel,"Mmmm. Mm-mmm. This sandwich tastes so young and impudent. Seymour, what's with the good grub?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm. Well, perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret. Do you remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I'd make something of him one day?"
Edna Krabappel,"Are you saying you killed Jimbo, processed his carcass, and served him for lunch?"
Bart Simpson,"Hmm, I wonder where Jimbo is today. He should've beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago."
Ãœter,"Frau Lunchlady, please to have another Sloppy Jimbo. Das is good, nein?"
Seymour Skinner,"Now, that's your third helping, young man. It's making you fat and soft... and tender. Hmmm... Uh, you just cut in line, didn't you? Report to detention, Uter."
Ãœter,For how long?
Seymour Skinner,Oh about seven minutes a pound should do it.
Lunchlady Doris,"Okay, I got your German grub right here."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called UterbrÃ¤ten?"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh relax, kids. I've got a gut feeling Uter's around here somewhere. After all, isn't there a little Uter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ate Uter and he's in our stomachs right now. Wait. Scratch that."
,
Lisa Simpson,Mom! Mom! You've gotta help! They're cooking kids in the school cafeteria!
Marge Simpson,"Listen, kids. You're eight and ten years old now. I can't be fighting all your battles for you."
Bart Simpson,But Mom!
Marge Simpson,"No buts. You march right back to that school, look them straight in the eye and say ""don't eat me."""
Lisa Simpson,Okay.
,
Edna Krabappel,"Since so many students have been put on ""permanent detention"" , we've merged everyone into a single class. I trust there are no objections?"
Edna Krabappel,Detention.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uhm, uh..psst-- hey you guys, I was just thinkin' that any one of us could be next, so what d'ya say we make a break for it?"
,
,
Seymour Skinner,"Easy there, young man. You'll only make yourself tired and stringy."
Seymour Skinner,Now to check on the free-range children.
Lunchlady Doris,
Groundskeeper Willie,Hold on kids! I'm comin' to rescue the lot of ye! I'll ju-
Groundskeeper Willie,"Oww! Ach, I'm bad at this."
,
Seymour Skinner,"I'm going to enjoy devouring you, Bart Simpson. Yes... I believe I'll start, as you've so often suggested, by eating your shorts."
Milhouse Van Houten,
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, guys. Something always comes along to save us."
Milhouse Van Houten,
Bart Simpson,"Nevertheless, I remain confident that something will come along and save the two Simpson children."
,
Marge Simpson,"Relax, honey. You were just having a crazy nightmare. You're back with your family now, where there's nothing to be afraid of -- except that fog that turns people inside out."
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,"Uh oh, it's seeping in! Stupid cheap weather stripping."
Lisa Simpson,ONE --
Lisa Simpson,CHORUS LINE OF PEOPLE / DANCIN' TILL THEY MAKE US STOP /
Groundskeeper Willie,TWO --
All,MANY DANCING PEOPLE/ COVERED WITH BLOODY GLOP.../
All,JUST ONE SNIFF OF THAT FOG AND YOU'RE INSIDE OUT / IT'S WORSE THAN THAT FLESH EATING VIRUS YOU'VE READ ABOUT....
All,VITAL ORGANS / THE FAMILY DOG IS EYEING BART'S INTESTINE/ HAPPY HALLOWEEN.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Remember Bart, I mean, ""Dances in Underwear,"" we take the white man alive."
Bart Simpson,"All right, ""Thinks Too Much,"" it shall be so."
Milhouse Van Houten,Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns... I mean Native Americans. They're after us because we gave them those blankets infected with cooties.
Ralph Wiggum,I ate all my caps.
Ralph Wiggum,
Bart Simpson,"Throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie, cowdorks."
Milhouse Van Houten,Why do we have to play this corny old game anyway? I brought my jacks.
Milhouse Van Houten,I got twosies!
Bart Simpson,"That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have the Killmatic 3,000 back then."
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, records from that era are spotty at best."
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Bart! Lisa! Time for church.
Grampa Simpson,Son!
Luann Van Houten,"Milhouse, time for church."
Jewish Man,"Shlomo, time for your violin lesson."
,
Bart Simpson,"Why the crap do we have to go to church, anyway?"
Marge Simpson,"You just answered your own question with that commode mouth. Besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency, and how to love your fellow man."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,And with flaming swords the Aramites did pierce the eyes of their fellow men and did feast on what flowed forth. Among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lust of or flesh...
Bart Simpson,I'M A TROLL MAN / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ I'M A TROLL MAN...
Marge Simpson,"I don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. Awful, awful hair."
Bart Simpson,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"And now my daughter Jessica, who has just returned from boarding school, will read the same passage I just read. I noticed a few of you weren't paying attention."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Wow, there is a God."
,
Engineer,"I'm tellin' you, the light would work better if it pointed out to sea."
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arrr! Shut up, I know what I'm doin'."
Captain Horatio McCallister,I hate the sea and everything in it!
,
Helen Lovejoy,"Bye, b-bye, b-bye... Thank you for choosing our church... B-Bye..."
Bart Simpson,I've never felt this way about a girl before. My long search is finally over.
Bart Simpson,Hi. I'm Bart Simpson. I was incredibly moved by your reading. I don't think God's words have ever sounded so plausible.
Jessica,"Thanks, Art. Um, I have to go over here now."
Bart Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart. It's not your fault Jessica doesn't like you."
Bart Simpson,"Is it my hair? My overbite? The fact that I've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?"
Jessica,"You're bad, Bart Simpson."
Lisa Simpson,"No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica are too different from each other to get along. She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy."
,
Teacher,"Good... very good... Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels."
Teacher,Bart Simpson?
Bart Simpson,"Yes Ma'am. I'd like to return to your wonderful Sunday school, please."
,
Bart Simpson,"I've changed my ways. Please give me another chance, ma'am."
Teacher,"All right, Bart, the Bible does teach forgiveness... Class, I want you to welcome back our prodigal son."
Class,Prodigal wha? / Who? / Huh? / What's prodigal mean?
Teacher,Oh dear.
Bart Simpson,"You know, the great thing about Sunday school is we're finally learning something we can use."
Jessica,"Yeah, so true. I have to turn my chair this way now."
Bart Simpson,"Somehow I gotta convince her I'm a good person. All right, I have to sit here and behave no matter what."
Teacher,"Okay, class. We have a special treat today for pass-around -- a replica of the slingshot David used to slay Goliath... While you kids are looking at that, I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet."
Bart Simpson,Must... fight... Satan. Make it... up to him... later.
Bart Simpson,You know I was considering staying after school and helping teacher clean up.
Jessica,Do you ever think anything you don't say?
Bart Simpson,There is just no pleasing a girl like that. All that unnecessary behaving... I'm all tensed through the chestal area. I need relief.
Groundskeeper Willie,Now that kilt was only for day-to-day wear. In battle we donned a full length ball gown covered in sequins. The idea was to blind your opponent with luxury.
Groundskeeper Willie,"Ah, 'tis no more than what God gave me, you Puritan pukes!"
Bart Simpson,That'll hold me. At least 'til I get my hands on some kind of explosives.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,No I'm not. I'm really...
Seymour Skinner,"Congratulations, Simpson. You just fell for our sting and won yourself three months detention. There's no such thing as Scotchtoberfest."
Groundskeeper Willie,There's not? You used me Skinner! You used me!
Bart Simpson,Three months .
Jessica,"Hi, Bart. I saw the way they set you up. That was really unfair."
Bart Simpson,
Jessica,Wanna have dinner at my house tonight?
Bart Simpson,"Really? Uh, sure."
Jessica,Great. We eat at seven.
Bart Simpson,There's only one thing to do at a moment like this... strut.
,
Homer Simpson,"I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh that's sweet, Homer. Our son is growing up, isn't he?"
Homer Simpson,"No, it's not that. Didn't you hear? They have no bananas. They have no bananas today."
,
Helen Lovejoy,"So Bart, how's school going? Jessica always gets straight A's."
Bart Simpson,"Well, in my family, grades aren't that important. It's what you learn that counts."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Six times five, what is it?"
,
Helen Lovejoy,"Hm, I didn't know the rocket sled was an Olympic event."
Bart Simpson,"Well no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Young man, explain yourself."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, I have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night, I heard a rather amusing story... This character named Martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark..."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"And don't you ever come near my daughter again! Never have I heard such gratuitous use of the word ""butt""."
Bart Simpson,"But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but..."
Helen Lovejoy,Make him stop! Make him stop!
Bart Simpson,O-kay.
Jessica,"Yes you are. You're bad, and I like it."
Bart Simpson,"I'm bad to the bone, honey."
Jessica,Let's go find some fun.
Bart Simpson,But your father said...
Jessica,"Oh, I told the ""Rev"" I was going to my room to say my prayers."
Bart Simpson,"Smart, beautiful, and a liar! So much better than that Sarah, plain and tall."
,
Bart Simpson,"Right there, put it right there. Oh, excellent. You're incredible, Jessica. Your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops, it's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,No way would a minister's daughter go out with you.
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah? I'll prove it.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Jessica."
Jessica,Yes? Am I supposed to know you?
Bart Simpson,Jessica we just...
Nelson Muntz,That's for besmirching an innocent girl's name!
Bart Simpson,Why?
Jessica,"I'm sorry, Bart -- you know my parents can't find out about us. And besides, if it's secret, it's even more exciting."
Bart Simpson,I guess.
Jessica,"Hey, you want to go skateboarding?"
Bart Simpson,"Um, actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second."
Jessica,"Come on, it'll be fun."
Bart Simpson,Wow. Now I have the energy to do anything!
Bart Simpson,Just give me two minutes.
Jessica,
,
Bart Simpson,"Jessica, I think this is too steep."
Jessica,"Bart, you can't trust your perception at this altitude."
Bart Simpson,"Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, I just might be able to hold on."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, the glue will slow me down."
Trucker #1,Any glue leaking?
Trucker #2,No. That glue ain't goin' nowhere.
Bart Simpson,Nothin's ever gonna stop me.
Trucker #1,"Ah, no. There goes the glue, after all!"
Bart Simpson,Nooooo!
Jessica,"Fun, huh?"
Bart Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,Have you noticed any change in Bart?
Homer Simpson,New glasses?
Marge Simpson,No. He looks like something might be disturbing him.
Homer Simpson,Probably misses his old glasses.
Marge Simpson,I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities. But then I'd be afraid of smothering him.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
Marge Simpson,That's not what I meant.
Homer Simpson,"It was, Marge. Admit it."
,
Jessica,Hi.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, we should get to class."
Jessica,What's the hurry?
Bart Simpson,We could get in trouble for being late.
Jessica,"Ah, you worry too much. Now come on, if you stay here awhile, I'll let you hold my hand."
Jessica,Team work! C'mon Bart!
Groundskeeper Willie,"If I don't sae the wee turtles, who will?!"
Groundskeeper Willie,Agh! Save me from the wee turtles! They were too quick for me! Aah!
,
Lisa Simpson,"I can't believe it, Bart. I'd always thought Jessica was so sweet."
Bart Simpson,"She's like a Milk Dud, Lis. Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside."
Lisa Simpson,You gotta give her up.
Bart Simpson,"No, no, wait. Hear my plan. I put up with her for seven more years. Then, we'll get married. Once the first baby comes along, she's bound to settle down and start treatin' me right. After all, I deserve it."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, it's naive to think you can change a person. Except maybe that boy who works in the library."
Ralph Wiggum,Do you have Go Dog Go?
Library Boy,That's in juvenile. This is young adult.
Lisa Simpson,Well read and just a little wild. If only someone could tame him.
Bart Simpson,"You're right, Lisa -- love isn't about fixing someone. I'm just going to give her up cold turkey. I'm not gonna talk to her or see her. It's over. Thanks for the advice, sis."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"There. If I can just get through this many days without seeing her, she should be completely out of my system. Okay, day one."
Marge Simpson,"Time for church, Bart. I bet your little friend Jessica will be there."
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,Jessica...
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, be strong. You don't need that little hell cat."
Bart Simpson,"Oh Lis, she's already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song."
Bart Simpson,That's very disturbing.
Jessica,"Hey, Bart. What? What's wrong?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug."
Homer Simpson,"Oh good, here comes the collection plate."
Marge Simpson,Thirty cents off Shake 'n Bake. Homer!
Homer Simpson,"We can spare it, Marge. We've been blessed."
Jessica,"You're right about everything, Bart. I have been too reckless. From now on I am going to settle down."
Bart Simpson,"Jessica, what are you doing!"
Jessica,It takes money to start a new life.
Bart Simpson,But stealing from the collection basket is really wrong. Even I know that.
Jessica,"Oh, fine. You just lost your cut."
Helen Lovejoy,"I'll just take that . Everyone, turn around and look at this!"
Grampa Simpson,"What is it, a Unitarian?"
Various Congregation Members,The collection money is gone! / That awful boy must have stolen it!
Bart Simpson,I...
Helen Lovejoy,"Took the money. Yes, we know."
Moe Szyslak,He confessed!
Homer Simpson,Stop him! He's headed for the window!
,
Homer Simpson,"Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didn't take the collection money, that's all I need."
Bart Simpson,I didn't take it.
Homer Simpson,Why you little... How can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, stop that. I believe him."
Homer Simpson,"Tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?"
Marge Simpson,That's what he wore to church.
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, how convenient."
Marge Simpson,"Bart honey, do you know who did take the money?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad."
,
Car,Crook!
Car,Thief!
Car #3,Stealer of money from the church collection plate!
,
Bart Simpson,We've gotta talk.
Jessica,"Listen, thanks for not turning me in. That was sweet."
Bart Simpson,"Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward."
Jessica,"Oh, don't you see? It's because I care for you that I can't come forward."
Bart Simpson,That doesn't make any sense.
Jessica,"All right, then I just don't feel like it, okay?"
Bart Simpson,"Jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice."
Jessica,Duh.
Bart Simpson,"You know, with the way you're treating me, why should I protect you?"
Jessica,"Because if you tell, no one will believe you. Remember, I'm the sweet, perfect minister's daughter and you're just yellow trash."
Bart Simpson,Huh?
,
Lisa Simpson,So here's where you're hiding.
Bart Simpson,Yeah. This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
Jasper Beardly,Thief.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
Ralph Wiggum,I won! I won!
Bart Simpson,"Give it up, Lis. She's a criminal mastermind. She's got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth grade level, and her hair smells like red Fruit Loops."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, well I eat Fruit Loops for breakfast."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Because of last week's problems, we'll be taking certain precautions with this week's collection."
Marge Simpson,We really shouldn't have let them do this. It can't be helping his self esteem.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, for our offertory reading, Lisa Simpson, who we'll all be keeping an eye on."
Lisa Simpson,"I know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. But doesn't the Bible teach us ""Judge not lest ye be judged,"" Reverend?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I think it might be somewhere towards the back.
Lisa Simpson,"There is someone among us with a guilty conscience. After much soul searching I decided it would be wrong of me to name names, but I urge that guilty person here, under the eyes of God, to come forward to confess and save yourself from the torment of your own personal hell."
Seymour Skinner,I smelled some marijuana smoke in Vietnam.
Grampa Simpson,"I was the one that canceled ""Star Trek""."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I left my Porsche keys inside Mrs. Glick.
Lisa Simpson,I am talking to the collection money thief. Only you can come forward and end this injustice.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, what the heck, it was Jessica Lovejoy."
Congregation,
Lisa Simpson,"If you search her room, I am certain you will find the money."
Homer Simpson,To the little girl's room!
,
Seymour Skinner,That's the collection money!
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, yeah, it smells like church."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I guess it's obvious what's happened here. Bart Simpson has somehow managed to sneak his bedroom into my house.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Well come on! Use your imaginations.
Jessica,"No, Dad, I did it. It's your classic cry for attention."
Seymour Skinner,"All right, first academic alert: Wiggum, Ralph..."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, young lady, I suppose we brought you home from boarding school a little prematurely."
Jessica,"I was expelled, Dad. Remember the pipe bomb? The glee club brawl? Remember the school chapel collection plate? The exploding toilets ring a bell? Come on dad, pay attention to me. Hello in there... hello?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES... BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES
Marge Simpson,"Uh, I think you all owe my son an apology."
Bart Simpson,That's okay. 'Preciate it... Mm Hmm.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Jessica."
Jessica,"Hi Bart, come to watch me suffer?"
Bart Simpson,"I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience, I really learned a lot... I'm a little wiser and a little less naÃ¯ve."
Jessica,"Well, I learned that I can make men do whatever I want."
Bart Simpson,"Well, don't you see, Jessica, then you really haven't learned --"
Jessica,"Um, would you finish scrubbing these steps for me?"
Bart Simpson,Will I!
Library Boy,"Hey, Jessica."
Jessica,Coming.
Bart Simpson,Poor sucker. It's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face. Not me though. Wait'll she sees the second rate job I do on these stairs. .

News Announcer,"It's Channel Six ""Action"" News!"
Bart Simpson,"Ah, Action News, the last place an impressionable kid can go for TV violence."
News Announcer,"Now, here's your ""Action"" Anchor, Kent Brockman."
Kent Brockman,Hello-I'm-Kent Brockman!
Kent Brockman,"Our top stories tonight, a tremendous explosion... in the price of lumber. And ""President Reagan dyes... his hair,"" says Garry Trudeau in his new musical comedy revue. But first, let's check the death count from the killer storm bearing down on us like a shotgun full of snow."
Weatherman,"Well Kent, as of now the death count is zero, but it is ready to shoot right up."
Kent Brockman,"Oh my God! Damn you, snow!"
Bart Simpson,"All right, snow day! No school tomorrow!"
Reporter,What a story!
Lisa Simpson,That doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report. What if the weatherman is wrong?
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist."
Weatherman,"Kent, I'd like to remind everybody to come down and watch me at the Springfield Laugh 'n Brew 'n Burgers 'n Fries this Saturday. The forecast calls for a seventy-five percent chance of hilarity."
Homer Simpson,I like those odds.
,
Lisa Simpson,Snowball fight!
,
Bart Simpson,You're gonna eat a blizzard of...
Bart Simpson,Unseasonable warmth...?
Lisa Simpson,I made the snowball from the frost in our freezer.
Jimbo Jones,"Nice p.j.'s, Simpson! Did your Mommy buy them for you?"
Bart Simpson,Of course she did. Who else would have?
Jimbo Jones,"All right Simpson, you win this round."
,
Edna Krabappel,"Okay, it's book report time! We'll do them alphabetically. Today it's ""A"" through ""M."""
Bart Simpson,I'm saved! I love being a S-s-s-simpson!
Edna Krabappel,"Let's see, we have no ""A's,"" so let's go right to the ""B's."" Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Huh?!
Edna Krabappel,Ha!!
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't..."
Seymour Skinner,"Attention. This is Principal Skinner, your principal, with a message from the principal's office. All students please proceed immediately to an assembly in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium. Dammit I wish we hadn't let the students name that one."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Children, the times, they are a-becoming quite different. Test scores are at an all time low. So I've come up with these ""Academic Alerts."" You will receive one as soon as your grades start to slip in any subject. This way, your parents won't have to wait until report card time to punish you."
Martin Prince,How innovative! I like it!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Hey, Dolph, take a memo on your Newton: Beat up Martin."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Bah.
Seymour Skinner,"No, no Ralph. This means you're failing English."
Ralph Wiggum,Me fail English? That's unpossible.
Seymour Skinner,"Muntz, Nelson. You're failing history, geography, and math. But ah, you're doing quite well in Home-Ec."
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, keep it down, man. Ha ha."
Seymour Skinner,Simpson...Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,Grades are all I have. What could I be failing? I'm smart and a teacher's pet.
Lisa Simpson,Gym?!! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
Lisa Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning. I really hope you try harder."
Homer Simpson,"Whew, that's all of 'em. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, I could use a new pair of hockey skates."
Homer Simpson,Done and done.
Lisa Simpson,That's not fair... Why is Bart getting a present and I'm getting chewed out?
Homer Simpson,"Ah, the mysteries of life."
,
Gym Teacher,"Tell you what, Simpson. I won't fail you if you join one of those Pee Wee teams outside the school."
Lisa Simpson,You mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?
Gym Teacher,"Look, I don't need this. I inhaled my favorite whistle this morning."
,
Lisa Simpson,
,
Female Coach,"Children, that was our only ball. There'll be no team this year."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, this is really scary. I'm gonna get my first 'F' ever."
Marge Simpson,Cheer up. So you're not good at sports. It's a very small part of life.
Homer Simpson,"Sports, sports, sports, sports. Sports, sports, sports, sports. Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports."
Homer Simpson,I mean my little girl buddy.
Marge Simpson,"I think Lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. How about letting her ride up front, too?"
Homer Simpson,I tried.
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, I'll kill you."
Bart Simpson,...Dad.
,
Chief Wiggum,"All right, Pigs. Beat those Gougers!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"I could have been equipment manager, but ""Nooo""..."
Lisa Simpson,Ooooh.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, no. Our goalie cannot stand up. Tell you what. Get some rope."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Defense! Defense! Come on, you call that blowing?!"
Chief Wiggum,"Oh yes, we won! We won! We won! Um, unfortunately, since I bet on the other team, ah, we won't be going for pizza."
Homer Simpson,"Well boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Here's your turtle, alive and well."
Bart Simpson,"Aw thanks, Dad."
Bart Simpson,How about some adulation from my li'l sister?
Lisa Simpson,"Wow Bart, I'm so impressed you were able to give Milhouse a concussion."
Bart Simpson,"Ah, you're just jealous..."
Bart Simpson,Because - you - stink - at - sports...
Lisa Simpson,"Cut it out, Bart!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"What the... Y'know, I wonder... if her skills will transfer over to the game of hockey. Well, only one way to be sure. Heads up little girl!"
Bart Simpson,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,The goalie of my dreams! Let's try a hard one to make sure it wasn't a fluke.
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey! Way to knock out my teeth!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yeah, that's it, Milhouse! Keep up the chatter!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, if the Bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."
Homer Simpson,"Oh! Ooh my - oh, the hell with it."
,
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think women should be able to play any sport men play, but hockey is so violent and dangerous. Look at Milhouse's teeth."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, will you stop showin' us those?"
Lisa Simpson,"I have to join the team, or I'll get an ""F"" that will haunt me for the rest of my life."
,
Justice,I now pronounce you President of these United...
Reporter,"Stop the inauguration! I just discovered our president ""elect"" got an ""F"" in second grade gym class."
Everyone,
Justice,"In that case, I sentence you to a lifetime of horror on Monster Island. Don't worry -- it's just a name."
,
Lisa Simpson,He said it was just a name.
Running Man,What he meant is that Monster Island is actually a peninsula.
Lisa Simpson,
Milhouse Van Houten,Do you have my teeff?
,
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, I want to make a few things clear."
Lisa Simpson,"Please, Dad, I'll be fine."
Homer Simpson,"I don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. No jokes, no taunting... Look! That kid's got bosoms! Who's got a wet towel?"
Homer Simpson,"Come here, you butterball."
Ãœter,"Don't make me run, I'm full of chocolate."
,
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,I can't even watch. I don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor Lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
Homer Simpson,"We're laughing with her, Marge! There's a big difference."
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,With her.
Lisa Simpson,"You really think I did okay out there, Mom?"
Marge Simpson,"Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net I really think you helped your team."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, little buddy, hop in!"
Marge Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, hon."
Homer Simpson,"Sucker. Competitive, violent, that's why you're here."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"We are having our best season ever. And I would like to say that it is because of teamwork. Gee, but who am I kidding, huh? It's all because of Lisa."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Let's hear it for Lisa!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart, if Lisa is better than you at hockey, does that mean you're gonna become better than her at school?"
Bart Simpson,"Maybe I will, Milhouse, maybe I will."
Edna Krabappel,Who can tell me the capital of Spain?
Edna Krabappel,Bart Simpson.
Edna Krabappel,The square root of thirty-six?
Edna Krabappel,Bart Simpson.
Edna Krabappel,Who freed the slaves?
Edna Krabappel,"Bart Simpson... Bart Simpson... Bart Simpson... Bart Simpson, will you stop raising your hand?! You haven't had one right answer all day."
Bart Simpson,Sorry.
,
Nelson Muntz,This is for wasting teacher's valuable time.
Lisa Simpson,"Lay off, guys. He's with me."
Jimbo Jones,It's a lucky coincidence you happen to be your sister's brother.
Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, Bart, they won't bother you anymore."
Seymour Skinner,I hardly ever let Mother fight for me anymore!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sorry, Bart, I'm gonna hang out with Lisa! For protection... and to be seen!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Come watch TV with me, Dad. We missed the first two episodes of Cops, but if we hurry we can catch the last three."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, sorry Bart, Lisa and I are going out for gelato. We'd ask you to come but, you know..."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I can spend some time with you."
Bart Simpson,"I dunno, Mom."
,
Marge Simpson,"Don't have a stereotypical view of me just because I'm your mother. I know. How about we play the basketball? I'm no Harvey Globetrotter, but..."
Bart Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Hey, watch out for the Shaq-attack!"
Bart Simpson,Ow.
Marge Simpson,I told you to watch out.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey Milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! Jimbo! Jimbo! Go for the face! Look! Ralph Wiggum lost his shin guard! Hack the bone! Hack the bone!"
Homer Simpson,"Wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. To think of all the time I wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... I love you."
,
Marge Simpson,"Lemme give my special little winner a big, big hug."
Lisa Simpson,Ma. I think I'm all hugged out. Oh... one more.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, queen Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, what are you doing in my room?"
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, certain differences, rivalries, if you will, have come up between us. At first I thought we can talk it over like civilized people. But instead, I just ripped the head off Mr. Honeybunny."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, that was your cherished childhood toy."
Bart Simpson,Mr. Honeybunny!
Homer Simpson,"Quiet down, Bart!"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, just get out of here."
Bart Simpson,Hey! It's a free country. You get out.
Lisa Simpson,That doesn't make sense.
Bart Simpson,"I know you are, but what am I?"
Lisa Simpson,Get out! Get out!
Bart Simpson,"Okay, but on my way, I'm gonna be doing this."
Bart Simpson,"If you get hit, it's your own fault."
Lisa Simpson,"Okay. Then I'm going to start kicking air like this. And if any part of you should fill that air, it's your own fault."
,
Marge Simpson,"Hm, I better go check that out. Now Homer, don't you eat this pie."
Homer Simpson,"Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this."
Homer Simpson,"And if you get eaten, it's your own fault."
Farmer,'Round back... oops.
Marge Simpson,Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Bart Simpson,"Mom, that is really annoying."
Lisa Simpson,Bart started it.
Bart Simpson,"Uh uh, Lisa started it."
Marge Simpson,I don't care who started it. I don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat. You are not in competition with each other.
Homer Simpson,Hey! Apu just called. This Friday Lisa's team is playing Bart's team. You're in direct competition. And don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. I want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
Homer Simpson,"Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight."
,
Chief Wiggum,"All right, I'm going to make a little deal with you mugs. I'm gonna let you all out to see my team play the hockey game if you promise to return to your cells."
Snake Jailbird,"Sorry, pig, we can't make that promise."
Chief Wiggum,"All right. All right, I'll sweeten the deal. You can see the game, you don't have to come back, but you have to promise not to commit any more crimes, okay?"
Snake Jailbird,No.
Chief Wiggum,I'll take that as a yes.
,
Terri Mackleberry,"At seven tonight the games begin / Bart versus Lisa, who will win / Their father's fat and their mother's thin / And Grampa Simpson reeks of gin."
Grampa Simpson,Hey! That's Obsession for Men!
,
Homer Simpson,Pass the ketchup.
Lisa Simpson,"You'll have to do better than that tonight, chump."
Homer Simpson,I asked for ketchup. I'm eating salad here.
Marge Simpson,I won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
Moe Szyslak,Hello.
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what are you doin' here?"
Moe Szyslak,"What? What? A bartender can't come by and say ""hi"" to his best customer? Hey, hey there, Midge! Oh gee I like what you done to your hair."
Bart Simpson,"You go, Mom. For the greater good."
Marge Simpson,"You caught me at a real bad time, Moe. I hope you understand I'm too tense to pretend I like you."
Moe Szyslak,"And how are the little kids doin'? I mean really how are they doin'. Any disabling injuries? Something, say, that the gambling community might not yet know about? Come here, let me see those knees."
Marge Simpson,"Moe, I think you should leave."
Moe Szyslak,But Blanche! You gotta help me out here. Please! I'm sixty-four grand in the hole. They're gonna take my thumbs!
,
Bart Simpson,"Good luck tonight, sis. I'll try not to hurt you."
Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, I'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head."
Bart Simpson,Mr. Honeybunny! You inhuman monster!
Lisa Simpson,You want a piece of me?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Stop it! Stop it! Conserve your precious hatred for the game.
Homer Simpson,"Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best."
Marge Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?"
Marge Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we can't root for one child over the other. You wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom!"
Lisa Simpson,Hi Mom! Over here! Mom!
Homer Simpson,Hi kids!

Hockey Announcer,"And now, to honor America, here's Krusty the clown."
Krusty the Clown,"OH SAY CAN YOU SEE... ... LIGHT, WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HEL... I shouldn't have turned down those cue cards ."
,
Homer Simpson,I love Bart!
Homer Simpson,"No, wait! I love Lisa!"
Homer Simpson,"Beer. Oh, Marge, I love you!"
Marge Simpson,He tripped my boy. I demand vengeance! I want vengeance!
Hockey Announcer,Jimbo Jones called for tripping. A penalty shot will be taken by Bart Simpson.
Lisa Simpson,For the greater good.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, Marge. A penalty shot, with only four seconds left. It's your child versus mine! The winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore."
Chief Wiggum,"Kill 'er, boy! Kill 'er!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Stop 'em dead, little girl!"
Crowd,"Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart!"
Crowd,Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart!
Bart Simpson,"Great game, Lis."
Lisa Simpson,"Great game, Bart."
Crowd,Tie game? / What the hell? / This is outrageous!
Marge Simpson,I've never been so proud of them.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,They're both losers. Losers!
Grampa Simpson,Rip off!
Hans Moleman,We paid for blood!
Chief Wiggum,Let's tear this place apart!
Grampa Simpson,Good idea!
Snake Jailbird,Those kids are like so sweet. If only they had had Pee Wee hockey when I was a lad. Oh well.
,
Bart Simpson,Damn FDA. Why can't it all be marshmallow?
Lisa Simpson,"Ew. Bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. They go in the trash."
Homer Simpson,"You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. ."
Lisa Simpson,How did you get tickets?
Homer Simpson,They hid them in every millionth Krusty Klump bar and Krusty Klump bar with almonds.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Hey, hey, hey! I have asked you nicely not to mangle my merchandise. You leave me no choice but to ask you nicely again."
Bart Simpson,CanIcometothecandyshow!?CanIcome!? CanIcome!?
Lisa Simpson,"No,me!Takeme!Me!Me!Me!"
Homer Simpson,"Sorry kids, but this is one event I want my darling wife by my side."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, well thank you Homer. But take one of the kids."
Homer Simpson,"Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, are all these pockets necessary?"
Homer Simpson,They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
Marge Simpson,"Well, that's the babysitter. No one in town will sit for you two anymore. I had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo."
Bart Simpson,Please the hobo. Please the hobo. Please the hobo.
Ashley,"Hi, I'm Ashley Grant."
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Ashley Grant! You gave a talk on women's issues at my school on how we don't have to be second class citizens.
Bart Simpson,Mom! How can you leave us with this maniac?!
Homer Simpson,"Hurry, Marge. If we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving Musketeers."
Marge Simpson,Well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs!
Bart Simpson,"So, you're one of those ""don't call me a chick"" chicks, huh?"
Lisa Simpson,"Eh, sorry about my unenlightened brother. He will make the next few hours a living hell."
Ashley,"Oh, I don't know. See this, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Disemboweler 4, the game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks."
Ashley,"Mmm hmm. Do a little housework, and you can play for five minutes."
Bart Simpson,No waaaay. Gg-aah... Yes'm.
Ashley,"See, Lisa? Males aren't hard to tame. They all follow their video cartridges."
Bart Simpson,Ow.

Pa,Mr. Goodbar to the front desk... The front desk is looking for Mr. Goodbar.
Homer Simpson,I feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
Homer Simpson,"Brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... Gimme those, etc."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"As you can see, I have created a lemonball so sour it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field. The candy, known as 77X42 -- Where the hell is the candy?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
Salesman,"Hey sir, try our wax lips. It's the candy of a thousand uses."
Salesman,"One, a humorous substitute for your own lips."
Homer Simpson,Mmm hmm. Keep going.
Salesman,"Two, ah... ooh, I'm needed in the basement."
Security Guard,"Ah, you're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am."
Homer Simpson,Oooh -- gummy bears. Gummy calves heads. Gummy jaw breakers.
Homer Simpson,What dat?
German Gummy Salesman,That is the rarest gummy of them all. The gummy Venus de Milo. Carved by gummy artisans who work exclusively in the medium of gummy.
Marge Simpson,"Will you two stop saying ""gummy"" so much."
Homer Simpson,Must have rare gummy. Distract the salesman Marge!
Marge Simpson,No. I won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
Marge Simpson,Oooh... how'd they get there?
Homer Simpson,"Now, this is going to take all my skill."
German Gummy Salesman,Halt! Halt!
Homer Simpson,"Run, Marge! Save the booty!"
Homer Simpson,"See you in hell, candy boys."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey Lis, I found a big caramel deposit at the small of her back!"
Lisa Simpson,I'm coming!
Marge Simpson,
Maggie Simpson,Wheee!
,
Marge Simpson,I'm sure it'll turn up. Take the baby-sitter home now. She's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge, there's plenty for her to do in there."
Homer Simpson,"See, she's having the time of her life."
,
Homer Simpson,"So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"
Ashley,I'm sorry?
Homer Simpson,"Nobody's blaming you. Hey, could you take the wheel for a second? I have to scratch myself in two places at once."
Ashley,Just drop me off here.
Homer Simpson,Precious Venus...
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, kids. Lots of candy left for breakfast."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Well why don't we give it to some needy children, then?"
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! The candy conventioneers tracked us down!
Ashley,There he is! There's the man that sexually harassed me!
Homer Simpson,For a minute there I thought I was in big trouble. It's just a...
,
Protesters,"Two four six eight / Homer's crime was very great! ""Great"" meaning ""large or immense"" / We used it in the pejorative sense!"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I swear I didn't touch her. You know how bashful I am. I can't even say the word ""titmouse"" without giggling like a schoolgirl."
Marge Simpson,"At any rate, I believe you and I think you should go outside and straighten this out. Some of their chants are very catchy and memorable."
Ashley,You grabbed me in the car!
Homer Simpson,Oh that. No. I was just grabbing a gummy Venus de Milo that got stuck to your pants.
Heavy Woman,Yeah right! That's the oldest excuse in the book.
Protesters,Boo!
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, I'm a decent guy..."
,
Bart Simpson,Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt? That's where cooties come from.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I don't understand. What is she saying you did?"
Homer Simpson,"Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah. That was brilliant."
Homer Simpson,"That's right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman."
Bart Simpson,"And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's kind of a gray area."
Bart Simpson,"We know you're innocent, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, kids."
Marge Simpson,They seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.
,
Marge Simpson,Homer! Wake up! Wake up!
Homer Simpson,"Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"
Protesters,"Boo! No respect for women, no peace."
Protesters,"Just try to push the right buttons now! We aren't crazy about nuclear power, either!"
Waylon Smithers,You people aren't allowed in here.
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, they're with me."
Protesters,Boo!
,
Homer Simpson,"They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay-- go."
Marge Simpson,Homer--
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh?
Marge Simpson,"I already talked to the Indignation Coordinator out on the lawn today. I told her you were a decent man. But she wouldn't listen. Besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more I can do."
Homer Simpson,"You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!"
Homer Simpson,Y'ello?
Deep Voice,"Hello, Homer. This is God...frey Jones from the TV magazine show, Rock Bottom."
Deep Voice,"We're aware of your problems and Mr. Simpson, we want to help."
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it."
,
Homer Simpson,"...Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed, she was sitting on the gummy Venus so I grabbed it off of her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy. I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is..."
Godfrey,"That was really great, Mr. Simpson, we got everything we need."
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Say, can you introduce me to the Sasquatch? I like his style."
,
Homer Simpson,Hee hee. Here comes the bouncing ball of justice!
ROCK BOTTOM ANNOUNCER,"Tonight on ""Rock Bottom:"" we go undercover at a sex farm for sex hookers."
Farmer,"I keep tellin' ya, I just grow sorghum here."
Voice,"Uh huh, and where are the hookers?"
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Awww, crap!"
Homer Simpson,"... Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so I grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! Oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! I just wish I had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"
Godfrey,"So, Mr. Simpson, you admit you grabbed her ""can"". What do you have to say in your defense?"
Godfrey,"Mr. Simpson, your silence will only incriminate you further."
Godfrey,"No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me! Get back! Get back!"
Godfrey,"Mr. Simpson, nooooo!"
ROCK BOTTOM ANNOUNCER,Dramatization. May not have happened.

Homer Simpson,"Marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. Now go upstairs and pack your bags. We're gonna start a new life under the sea."

Homer Simpson,UNDER THE SEA / UNDER THE SEA / THERE'LL BE NO ACCUSATIONS / JUST FRIENDLY CRUSTACEANS / UNDER THE SEA.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. It's not gonna happen."

Homer Simpson,
TV Announcer,Simpson scandal update: Homer sleeps nude in an oxygen tent which he believes gives him sexual powers!

Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's a half truth."
Crying Woman,"I don't know Homer Simpson, I never met Homer Simpson or had any contact with him but... ...I'm sorry, I can't go on."
Female Host,That's okay. Your tears say more than real evidence ever could.
Marge Simpson,"Yes, yes, yes. That's fine. Good, good."
Homer Simpson,Whaa?
Ben Announcer,"Today on ""Ben""... Mothers and runaway daughters, reunited by their hatred of Homer Simpson. And here's your host, Gentle Ben."
Woman,I just have one thing to say: Let's have less Homer Simpsons and more money for public schools.
Ben,
Woman #2,"Ben, I have a question."
Trainer,"No, Ben! No!"
Fox Announcer,"And now, we return to Fox Night at the Movies. ""Homer S.: Portrait of An Ass Grabber,"" starring Dennis Franz."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ""Portrait!"" Sounds classy... doesn't it?"
Young Babysitter,"No, Mr. Simpson! A cat is a living creature!"
Dennis Franz,I don't care!
Dennis Franz,"Now, I'm gonna grab me sumpin' sweet!"
Young Babysitter,"No, Mr. Simpson. That's sexual harassment. If you keep it up, I'll yell so loud the whole country'll hear."
Dennis Franz,With a man in the White House? Not likely.
Kent Brockman,"This is hour fifty-seven of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside the Simpson estate. Remember, by the way, to tune in tonight at eight o'clock for highlights of today's vigil, including when the garbage man came, and when Marge Simpson put the cat out. Possibly because it was harassed, we don't know."
Kent Brockman,"Of course, there's no way to see into the Simpson home without some kind of infrared heat-sensitive camera. So let's turn it on."
Kent Brockman,"Now this technology is new to me, but I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. His body temperature has risen to over four hundred degrees. He's literally stewing in his own juices. Now here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95 percent of the people believe Homer Simpson is guilty. Of course, this is just a television poll, which is not legally binding. Unless Proposition 304 passes, and we all pray it will."
Homer Simpson,I don't have a friend in the world.
Moe Szyslak,Let us through!
Marge Simpson,Oh really?
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon on let us through, you vultures."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. It's a miracle."

Marge Simpson,I hope you kept the Homie fires burning...
Marge Simpson,Homer.
Moe Szyslak,"How can you judge this man, without talking to the people who know him best. We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the biddin' starts at ten G's."
Reporter,I bid ten G's!
Aussie Reporter,Ten five G's!
,
Homer Simpson,I need a hug.
Homer Simpson,How come you guys hesitated?
Lisa Simpson,"Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do."
Bart Simpson,It's just hard not to listen to TV. It's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
Homer Simpson,Maybe TV is right. TV's always right.
Homer Simpson,Are you hugging the TV?
Lisa Simpson,No.
David Letterman,And the number one reference that I am running into the ground is... Ho-mer Simpson.
Bumblebee Man,Ai yi yi! Es Homer Simpson. Me ha molestado. Ohh!
Homer Simpson,"I like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. I know - ""Evening at the Improv."" They never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."
Standup,"See I think about weird stuff. Like what would happen if E.T. and Mr. T. had a baby? Well, you'd get Mr. E.T. wouldn't ya? And you know I think he'd sound a little something like this: I pity the fool who doesn't phone home."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I wouldn't want to be Mr. T right now."
Marge Simpson,Homer! Homie! The kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name!
Lisa Simpson,"The media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. All they care about is entertainment. Well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word ""entertainment"" -- Public Access Television."
Homer Simpson,But those shows all look so crummy.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we can dress it up a bit. We can bring a fern... and a folding chair from the garage... And the most decorative thing of all: the truth."
,
,
Marge Simpson,There are only forty-nine stars on that flag.
Grampa Simpson,"I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground before I recognize Missoura."
Lisa Simpson,Now it's time for the Innocence Report with Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson,"Hello. I am Homer Simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, ""Father Goose."" You know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. Nobody cares that I didn't do it. But I didn't. Okay, look, I've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. Like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. So I figured, ""We'll see about that."" So I get this big chunk of cinderblock and I..."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, gotta go. Innocent!"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you did it! I am so proud of you."
Teenage Manager,The switchboards are lighting up!
Lisa Simpson,Yay!
Teenage Manager,Two calls! That's our best ever!
Teenage Manager,"Hello?... No, Janis doesn't live here. Hello? Yes I am interested in long distance savings. Very interested."

Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is so depressing. My only hope is this homemade Prozac. Hmm... needs more ice-cream."
Bike Rider,"So uh, you don't like the old time bikes, huh?"
Groundskeeper Willie,"Homer, I love amateur video and your show is the most amateur video I ever saw."
Groundskeeper Willie,My hobby is secretly videotaping couples in cars. I didnae come forward because in this country it makes you look like a pervert. But every single Scottish person does it.
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Oh baby, oh yeah... Oh, baby..."""
Groundskeeper Willie,"No, that's Mayor Quimby."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Ah, here we go."
Homer Simpson,Precious Venus...
Homer Simpson,Thank you!
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, this clears you completely!"
Marge Simpson,"You know, the courts might not work anymore, but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done."
,
Lisa Simpson,See?
Ashley,"Hmm. Homer, I thought you were an animal, but your daughter said you were a decent man. I guess she was right."
Homer Simpson,You're both right.
,
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Godfrey,"In our mad pursuit of a scoop, we members of the press sometimes make mistakes. Rock Bottom would like to make the following corrections:"
Bart Simpson,Wow. V8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.
Homer Simpson,And Ted Koppel is a robot.
Lisa Simpson,"There's you, Dad!"
Lisa Simpson,Yay!
ROCK BOTTOM ANNOUNCER,Tomorrow on Rock Bottom. He's a foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least suspect it. He's Rowdy Roddy Peeper.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that man is sick!"
Marge Simpson,"Groundskeeper Willie saved you, Homer."
Homer Simpson,But listen to the music. He's evil!
Marge Simpson,Hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
Homer Simpson,"Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing."
Homer Simpson,Let's never fight again.
Announcer,"We now return to the 1971 film ""Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie, and the Great Frisco Freak-Out!"" starring Troy McClure."
Uncle Doobie,"Slim, if we've got the bag with the stolen diamonds, then what happened to the bag with our stash?"
GOODTIME SLIM,"There's more than one way to get high, baby."
Uncle Doobie,Whhoooooaa!!
,
Homer Simpson,"Please, Marge. How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late-night TV?"
Marge Simpson,"Is there something wrong, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,"No. It's just that I've only seen this movie twice before, and I've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- What I meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. I promise."
Homer Simpson,Enchiladas.
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Mom!! Dad!!
Marge Simpson,Don't turn on the light! Don't turn on the light!
Bart Simpson,There's a U.F.O. outside my window!! Seriously!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart. It's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree."
Bart Simpson,C-c-can I sleep in there with you guys tonight?
Marge Simpson,No!
Bart Simpson,Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a U.F.O. does come?
Marge Simpson,We need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but I promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex."
Marge Simpson,I simply can't wait that long. Maybe we should get some help... How 'bout a book?
Homer Simpson,Ooooookay.
Marge Simpson,A tasteful book.
Homer Simpson,Oh. All right.
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge! This guy looks like Apu!"
Marge Simpson,Shh. I don't want people to see us looking at these books.
Bart Simpson,"Hi, guys. Whatcha lookin' at?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I'm just reading up on, artillery."
Homer Simpson,Yes. And I am pursuing my interest in...
Marge Simpson,"This one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey, you know, that nice Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh. ""Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American."""
Lisa Simpson,"Mom! Dad! Look, this biography of Peter Uebberoth is only ninety-nine cents! And I found the new Al Gore book!"
Marge Simpson,Sane Planning: Sensible Tomorrow.
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, I hope it's as exciting as his other book ""Rational Thinking: Reasonable Future!"""
Bart Simpson,I'm getting this book on U.F.O.s.
Bart Simpson,"Did you know they're real, but there's a huge government conspiracy to cover it up?"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy."

Colonel Leslie Hapablap,"Mr. Vice President! Someone finally bought a copy of your book, sir!"
Vice President Gore,"Well, This calls for a celebration."
Kool & the Gang,CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES / C'MON! / LET'S CELEBRATE...

Homer Simpson,N -- -- yes. But please don't you say that word.
Grampa Simpson,"That's the house you grew up in, Son."
Paul Harvey,"Hello Americans, Paul Harvey here. Did you know every good American is, at heart, an erotic American? Iiiit's true. A famous couple -- I don't need to tell you it was Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower -- offered this advice: double your pleasure with a bath, together!"
Marge Simpson,"HomeIE, I can't quite..."
Homer Simpson,Faucet's jammed into my back... I'm stuck.
Marge Simpson,So am I.
Marge Simpson,Kids? Kids?

Paul Harvey,"A romantic vacation can provide... titillation. Sensual, sanitary seclusion awaits you at any of America's fine Triple-A Approved motor lodges."
,
Marge Simpson,The Arabian Nights Room looks nice...
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus."
Desk Clerk,"Uh, sorry there Fred and Ethel. Shoulda made a reservation. We only got uh, one room left."
Mayor Joe Quimby,The uh... toilet is overflowing in the uh Caveman Room!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, here we are. The ""Utility Room."""
Marge Simpson,This isn't very erotic. I think it's an actual utility room.
Homer Simpson,"No, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room."
Desk Clerk,"Don't mind me, folks. Just need to get the ol' Wet-Dry Vac."

Homer Simpson,You're home safe. Done my duty. See ya the next time we need your signature.
Grampa Simpson,"Aw, you never wanna spend any time with me. But I can help you with your lovin' problem. I got a home remedy that will put the zowsers back in your trousers."

Homer Simpson,You want me to spend more time with dad? What about my New Year's resolution?
Marge Simpson,You could make a lot of money.
Homer Simpson,Yeah... Where are my pants?
Marge Simpson,You threw them out the window in a fit of passion. You said you were never going to need them again.

Maude Flanders,"Oh, hurry, Neddie! They're awful."
Ned Flanders,You just be ready with that garbage bag.

Homer Simpson,"Hoo mama! This is finally really happening. After years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme! And quick!"
Homer Simpson,"Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!"
Homer Simpson,"Ow. I guess people have some sort of ""moral objection"" to our sex-drug."
Grampa Simpson,"Lemme sell it, you idjit."
Grampa Simpson,"Step right up, folks, and witness the magnificent medicinal miracle of Simpson & Son's Patented Revitalizing Tonic!"
Grampa Simpson,"Put some ardor in your larder with our energizing, moisturizing, tantalizing, romanticizing, sur-prising, her-prizing, revitalizing tonic!"
Shoppers,
Professor Jonathan Frink,I doubt very highly that one elixir could boast so many fantastic properties.
Professor Jonathan Frink,"What say we amscray outta here and have a wild wing-ding at the cyclotron, Doctor?"
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Anything you say, Professor!"
Kirk Van Houten,"Tonight we'll push the twin beds together. And I found something for Milhouse down at the mall, too! A pup tent!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, boy! Now I can sleep out in the yard!"
Kirk Van Houten,Yeah! Every single night!
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"I've discovered that the ""rejuvenating"" effect people feel is actually a mild form of poisoning, no doubt a result of the unsanitary conditions in Grampa Simpson's bathtub. Nonetheless..."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,What's goin' on? Where are the grown-ups?
Nelson Muntz,"Who cares? With no adults around, I run this city! Er, carry on."
Bart Simpson,"Listen to this. ""Unexplainable Behavior. Individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with UFOs, or other paranormal phenomena, e.g. telephone explosions."""
Milhouse Van Houten,"Geez! If it's in a book, it's gotta be true!"
Bart Simpson,"Scary, no? And this guy's head of the Spaceology Department at the Correspondence College of Tampa!"
Ralph Wiggum,Will you cook my dinner for me? My parents aren't around and I'm not allowed to turn on the stove.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Hurry up! We got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid..."
Homer Simpson,Great. I'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.

Grampa Simpson,"...and that's what's wrong with Bart's generation. Now, as for your generation..."
Homer Simpson,
,
Grampa Simpson,"And for the minimal outlay of one dollar, you can take home a bottle of Liquid Lothario! Distilled Don Juan! Catalytically-Carbonated Casanova! Lock old Rover in the shed, 'cause man has a new best friend in Simpson and Son's Revitalizing Tonic!"
Goony-looking Man,I'm not convinced. I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs.
Grampa Simpson,"All questions will be answered, all fears will be allayed, with one incontrovertible demonstration! May I have a volunteer from the audience? Yes, you, sir!"
Grampa Simpson,"Now, sir, you have never seen me before. Is that correct?"
Homer Simpson,That is correct.
Audience Member,Well then how come his face is on the bottle?
Grampa Simpson,Umm... umm...
,
Grampa Simpson,You're the worst shill I ever seen! You're a disgrace to the medicine show business!
Homer Simpson,They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
,
Bart Simpson,Okay. It's now painfully clear. The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.
Milhouse Van Houten,"You fool! Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy? Or have they gotten to you, too?"
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it! Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? Haven't you heard of Occam's Razor? ""The simplest explanation is probably the correct one."""
Bart Simpson,So what's the simplest explanation?
Lisa Simpson,"I don't know. Maybe they're all reverse vampires, and they have to get home before dark."
Kids,Reverse vampires! / Etc.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. That's Amos Pierson's Moose Farm. Make a right, here."
Homer Simpson,"Ewww, why're we stopping at this dump?"
Homer Simpson,Wow. Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, we lived here till the bank foreclosed in sixty-three. Farm went bust after the cows started givin' sour milk. Somethin' musta spooked 'em good."
,
Grampa Simpson,
Cows,
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, memories. If this old place could talk, it'd say..."
Grampa Simpson,Yah! Ooh! Ow! Wah!
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Ow!

John F. Kennedy,"If uh, I may, Helen, I'd like to respond to that question with yet another flip remark..."
Reporters,
Mona Simpson,"Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer could grow up to be president some day!"
Grampa Simpson,"You, president? This is the greatest country in the world. We got a whole system set up to keep people like you from ever becomin' president. Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead."
Grampa Simpson,"Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead."
Homer Simpson,"Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? Maybe I could've been something more than I am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm."
,
Grampa Simpson,Who are you to complain? You lock me up in a home and give me the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas!
,
Homer Simpson,"Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me."
Grampa Simpson,That's 'cause you're a screw-up.
Homer Simpson,You're the screw-up!
Grampa Simpson,Why you little...!
Homer Simpson,All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
Grampa Simpson,This tonic's caused me nothin' but trouble. You've done all the damage you're gonna do!
Grampa Simpson,"If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago, you'da never been born and I'da been happy! You were an accident!!"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Get out.
Grampa Simpson,I'm sorry I said that.
Homer Simpson,Out.
Grampa Simpson,"I'm gonna get out of the car, and I hope you'll find it in your heart not to drive awa--"
Grampa Simpson,"Well, I'll be all right as long as I can remember my Army training... Dang."
,
Grampa Simpson,I'm sorry.
Grampa Simpson,Hi?
Marge Simpson,"Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?"
Homer Simpson,"Of course not Marge, just for the rest of his life. He said I was an accident. He didn't want to have me!"
Marge Simpson,You didn't want to have Bart.
Homer Simpson,"I know, but you're never supposed to tell the child."
Marge Simpson,You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning.
Homer Simpson,"But when I do it, it's cute."
,
Bart Simpson,"So, finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults. Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Okay, here's what we've got. The Rand Corporation, in conjunction with the saucer people..."
Bart Simpson,Thank you.
Milhouse Van Houten,Under the supervision of the reverse vampires...
Milhouse Van Houten,"... are forcing our parents to go to bed early in a fiendish plot to eliminate the meal of DINNER! We're through the looking glass here, people!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve."
Maggie Simpson,
,
Grampa Simpson,"Aw, nuts."
Homer Simpson,Dad!
Grampa Simpson,"And just feast your ears on this tantalizing testimonial from my own flesh and blood, the son who puts the fun in ""Simpson & Son"" -- my son, Barney!"
Barney Gumble,"I used to be a fat, disgusting slob."
Onlooker,That medicine seems to be givin' your son a lotta gas.
Grampa Simpson,I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol problem.
Grampa Simpson,It just ain't the same without Homer. He knew how to drive a car.
,
Homer Simpson,"Son! My dear Son. From now on I'm going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your ""old man"" is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!"
Bart Simpson,"Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: that is a girl's bike."
Homer Simpson,"You're no girl, you're a boy. A good boy. You can be president. Scratch that. You will be president."
Lisa Simpson,Dad!
Homer Simpson,I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad. I want to get down. This tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me."
Homer Simpson,Wheeee! Wheeee!!!
Lisa Simpson,No! No! No! No!!!
Bart Simpson,"No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting."
Homer Simpson,B-But I'm using my whole ass.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
Homer Simpson,"Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
Bart Simpson,"I'm sure he meant to say ""serious drinking."""
Lisa Simpson,That's what I assumed.
,
,
Homer Simpson,Here's where it all started to go wrong. How'm I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
Homer Simpson,Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.
Homer Simpson,Dad? This photo is a blessing. It eases my pain.
Homer Simpson,I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.
Grampa Simpson,"No, I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house."
Homer Simpson,You know what?
Grampa Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,We're both screw-ups.
Grampa Simpson,It doesn't matter. What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you.
Homer Simpson,So are you gonna say something nice now?
Grampa Simpson,"Well, I hadn't thought that far ahead."
Grampa Simpson,"Okay, here it goes... I'm not sorry I had you, Son. And I was always proud that you weren't a short man."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Dad."
Grampa Simpson,"Whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?"
Homer Simpson,"I'm with you, Dad."

Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Moe. You got change for a five?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, sure thing, Lenny."
Moe Szyslak,"Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ow! A snake in the cash register. Great prank, fellas, great. Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight."
Barney Gumble,"Hey Moe, you wanna smell my flower?"
Moe Szyslak,Do I?!
Moe Szyslak,"I'm burnin' up, here. Ooh, ooh, taking advantage of my alcohol soaked clothes. It's funny and it makes you think."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh I need some coffee before I black out. Homer, pass me the sugar."
Homer Simpson,This is gonna to be great.
Moe Szyslak,Ooh!
Barney Gumble,Geez!
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, there's sugar all over the bar now."
Lenny Leonard,"That's not funny, Homer."
Barney Gumble,"Yeah, we were just messin' around. And you had to go too far."
Moe Szyslak,How many people want Homer banned from this place for life?
Moe Szyslak,Yeah!
Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me."
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer. You should have thought of that before you gave me the old sugar-me-do. I'm taking your caricature down from Mt. Lushmore."
Moe Szyslak,And I'm pulling your favorite song out of the juke box.
Homer Simpson,It's Raining Men?
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, not no more it ain't."
Waylon Smithers,Oww. Ohh...
Homer Simpson,Jokes on them. I'm still alive.
,
Bart Simpson,"Cheer up, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Can't.
Bart Simpson,Okay.
Marge Simpson,What if you pretended that this couch were a bar? Then you could spend more nights at home with us. Huh?
Homer Simpson,I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
Lisa Simpson,"Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know that the Chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?"
Homer Simpson,"Yes. Cris-a-tunity. You're right! I've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. That's it. I'm going to find a new bar to drink in. And I'm gonna get drunker than I've been in my entire life! Bart, where's my wallet?"
Bart Simpson,"Right here, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Thank you!
,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, classy."
Host,"Good evening, sir. Would you please leave without a fuss right now?"
Homer Simpson,Okay.

Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. This looks like a nice, friendly place."
Carla,"Sammy, you're too old to go on a date with two twins on the same night you're supposed to marry Diane without Rebecca knowing."
Sam,"Okay Carla. I'll make you a bet. If this affects my major league comeback, I'll sell the bar."
Norm,"Woody, gimme a beer."
Woody,"I think you've had enough, Mr. Peterson. My chiropractor says I can't carry you home anymore."
Norm,"Just give me another beer, you brain dead hick."
Norm,I'll kill you! I'll kill all of ya!
Cliff,"Whoa! Settle down, Normie. Gotta save those pipes for karaoke."
Homer Simpson,
Norm,I love you guys.
,
,
Marge Simpson,I just left my first session and I haven't even opened my mouth yet.
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. There's something bothering me about this place. I know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. Enjoy your death trap, ladies."
Woman,What was her problem?
,
Man,"Greetings, good man. Might I trouble you for a drink?"
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, get outta here, Homer."
Man,Homer? Who is Homer? My name is Guy Incognito.
Homer Simpson,"Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!"
Homer Simpson,"Here, Puff! Here Puff!"
Homer Simpson,"The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm gonna have to quit drinking."
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, liver."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, my liver hurts."
,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a beer, please."
Bartender,"Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink in here."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, but I am a pilot."
Bartender,Where's your uniform?
Homer Simpson,I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
Bartender,"Well, you talk the talk. Here's a loner."
Runway Signaler,"We need a pilot. Pronto. Who wants to fly to the ""Windy City?"""
Runway Signaler,Conditions are windy.
Runway Signaler,You.
Homer Simpson,But I -
Runway Signaler,"Hey, you're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink here, are you?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here."
Runway Signaler,You fly boys. You crack me up.
,
Homer Simpson,"But, I keep tellin' ya, I'm not a pilot."
Runway Signaler,"And I keep telling you, you fly boys crack me up."
Alan,"Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your co-pilot."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan."
Homer Simpson,"And um, ah, I'll just uh get us started..."
Alan,"Uh, we'll need that to live."
,
Executive,"If word gets out about this, Kwazy Klown Airlines will be a laughing stock. In exchange for your silence, I'm prepared to offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the United States. Excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The freak states."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
Homer Simpson,"Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want."
Bart Simpson,Alaska!
Lisa Simpson,Hawaii!
Marge Simpson,"I don't know, Homer. We're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season."
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, you deserve a vacation. It's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state."
Marge Simpson,"I don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden."
Homer Simpson,"Come on Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want to visit strange exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you please?"
,
,
Homer Simpson,"So Marge, pretty sweet, eh?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. If someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, great. I specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby."
Grampa Simpson,"Wow, we must really be flying high. Those people down there look all tiny and blurry... just like the inside of a cataract."
Stewardess,"Attention passengers. Due to our policy of overselling flights, this flight has been oversold. In accordance with FAA rules, the first two people to the front will be upgraded to first class."
Stewardess,"Okay, you two."
Lisa Simpson,"C'mon, Bart. They're gonna pamper us. Not literally, of course."
Bart Simpson,"I come for the service, but I stay for the leg room."
Pilot,Flight crew prepare for take off.
Marge Simpson,I think I'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.
Lisa Simpson,"See, Dad. I told you Mom would have problems."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, what's wrong? Are you Hungry? Sleepy? Gassy? Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I've never told you this before, but I'm not a good flyer. I have to get off the plane. Let me off the plane. I'm asking you nicely to open the doors."
Homer Simpson,"Take it easy, Marge. How 'bout if we dope you up real good?"
Marge Simpson,Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!

Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. We don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us."
,
Bart Simpson,"You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something..."
,
Grampa Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,I'm sure it's nothing.
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, are you feeling any better?"
Marge Simpson,"Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it."
Homer Simpson,Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.
Bart Simpson,"So much for the days when I could say ""at least my mother's normal."""
Marge Simpson,"Well, everybody's got a fear of something."
Homer Simpson,Not everybody.
Marge Simpson,Sock puppets.
Homer Simpson,Where? Where?
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?"
Marge Simpson,Sure as sugar.
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. Push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again."
Lisa Simpson,"But if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come out in other ways."
Marge Simpson,I just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog. They've been living in sin.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, you've been cooking all night?"
Marge Simpson,"Judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one, you are."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"No, no honey, it's all right. Really. I'm fine. I'm all right. Mother always said ""don't complain. Be good. Behave, behave. Be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."""
Homer Simpson,"You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave."
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's three A.M. Shouldn't you be baking?"
Marge Simpson,In a little while.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, can we talk to you?"
Marge Simpson,Can't talk. Keeping myself in a state of cat-like readiness.
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, neat... anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy."
Marge Simpson,"Mm, no, I don't need therapy, I'm fine. And it's too expensive."
Homer Simpson,And I don't believe in it. It breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. You don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
Psychic,"Hello, Radio Psychic. You will die a terrible, terrible death. Ooh I'm sorry, that was our last caller. Okay, I'm getting something now... huh?... Okay, you will die a terrible, terrible death."
Marge Simpson,But I...
Announcer,"Thank you for calling ""Radio Psychic."" Do you have a song request?"
Homer Simpson,It's Raining Men!
,
Homer Simpson,"Now Marge, ""Dear Abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. Ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""Hero."" ""Fearless."" ""Alive."""
,
Man,"No thanks to the plane, many of us are still..."
All,Alive.
Additional Man,We certainly are.
Man,Pass me another hunk of co-pilot.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, Mom's getting worse. You have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. Look how tense she is."
Homer Simpson,She's fine.
Homer Simpson,Oh.
,
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?"
Homer Simpson,"All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a psychiatrist. She's gonna tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family, and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I like picking beans with grandma."
Homer Simpson,"Well keep it up, then."
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, I will."
Homer Simpson,"Good, you do that."
Lisa Simpson,Fine.
Homer Simpson,You'll be picking many a bean.
Lisa Simpson,Hope I do.
Bart Simpson,I don't believe it! Principal Skinner!
Bart Simpson,"Well, well, well. I never thought I'd win this easy."
Seymour Skinner,"Huh, this has nothing to do with you, Simpson. I have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down."
Bart Simpson,Okay.
,
Homer Simpson,All right. How much do you charge?
Dr. Zweig,"If money's a problem, I charge on a sliding scale. I can go as low as thirty dollars an hour."
Homer Simpson,Keep sliding.
Marge Simpson,Thirty dollars will be fine.
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. First, what are your qualifications?"
Dr. Zweig,Well...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, I'm not here to take a reading test. I wanna see some credentials."
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid you'll blame all my problems on him."
Dr. Zweig,I'm not here to blame anyone.
Dr. Zweig,"Marge, therapy can be an intense process."
Marge Simpson,
Dr. Zweig,We're going to delve deeply into your subconscious and we're not going to stop until we've exposed the root of your fear of flying.
Marge Simpson,
Dr. Zweig,"Don't worry, this is a private sanctuary where whatever transpires will be just between us."
Dr. Zweig,"Oh, that's just Murray, the window washer. He comes everyday at 12:00."
Marge Simpson,But it's a few seconds before 12:00.
Homer Simpson,"You see?! You see?! ""I"" just left ""my"" first session and ""I"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."
,
Dr. Zweig,"Marge, there's no simple explanation for your fear of flying. But it can probably be traced to some childhood trauma. Think back, what's the earliest memory you have of something bad happening?"
Marge Simpson,Hmm. That would have to be my first day of school.
,
Selma Bouvier,"They got this thing called a ""fire drill."" They use it to drill a flaming hole in your head."
Marge Simpson,
Patty Bouvier,And there's only one big toilet and they make you all go at the same time.
Marge Simpson,The kids at school were even worse.
,
Girl,"Ew, you like The Monkees? You know they don't write their own songs!"
Marge Simpson,They do so!
Girl,They don't even play their own instruments...
Marge Simpson,No! No!
Girl,That's not even Michael Nesmith's real hat.
Marge Simpson,
,
Dr. Zweig,Kids can be so cruel.
Marge Simpson,But it's true. They didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments.
Dr. Zweig,"The Monkees weren't about music, Marge! They were about rebellion, about political and social upheaval."
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Did you talk about me in therapy today?
Marge Simpson,I don't think so.
Homer Simpson,"Tell me the truth! Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't. Happy family, happy family."
,
Marge Simpson,"I keep having the same dream. I'm the mother from ""Lost In Space."""
,
Marge Simpson,"Ready for breakfast, Doctor Smith?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, being stuck on this God forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite I have."
Lisa Simpson,Warning. Warning. Doctor Smith refuses to do his astro chores.
Homer Simpson,"Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!"
Lisa Simpson,"Danger, danger... My hooks are flailing wildly!"
Marge Simpson,Wait! Daddy! Wait! Please don't leave. Take me with you!
,
Dr. Zweig,"Marge, are you aware you just said ""please don't leave"" to your daddy?"
Marge Simpson,"No, I didn't."
Dr. Zweig,"Yes, you did. And you also infringed on any number of copyrights. Now, let's talk about your father."
Marge Simpson,"Sure, okay. I'll talk about father. Father Christmas. That's what they call Santa Claus in England. They drive on the wrong side of the road there. Now that's crazy. People are always saying how small England is. But you couldn't fit it all in here. Not by a long shot. You know what? I'm cured."
Dr. Zweig,Marge get back here... and tell me about your father. What did he do for a living?
Marge Simpson,Okay. Okay... But you're gonna make a big deal outta this. He was a pilot.
Dr. Zweig,A pilot? This is a big deal.
Marge Simpson,You see.
Dr. Zweig,"Marge this may not be the best time to bring this up, but uh, your last check bounced."
Marge Simpson,Wait. I'm remembering something...
Dr. Zweig,"Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of..."
Marge Simpson,I was a little girl...
,
Mr. Bouvier,"Goodbye, Margie. Be a good girl, now."
Marge Simpson,Why does Daddy have to leave?
Jacqueline Bouvier,Because he's a pilot. He flies all over the world.
Marge Simpson,I want to see Daddy fly!
Jacqueline Bouvier,"Margie, oh come back!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Daddy?! Daddy, where are you, Da..."
Mr. Bouvier,"So who wants a pre-flight cookie? Fig Newtons, Hydrox?"
Marge Simpson,Daddy?
Mr. Bouvier,Don't look at me! DON'T LOOK AT ME!!
,
Marge Simpson,My father was a stewardess.
Dr. Zweig,"Marge, there's nothing to be ashamed of here. Today, male flight attendants or ""Stewards"" are common."
Marge Simpson,They are?
Dr. Zweig,Yes. Thanks to trailblazers like your father. You might say he was a pioneer.
Marge Simpson,Yeah... You might even say he was an American hero.
Dr. Zweig,Let's not go nuts. The important thing is that we've pinpointed the precise moment when you developed your fear of flying.
Marge Simpson,"Wait, some other stuff's coming back to me."
,
Gramma Bouvier,Open wide. Here comes the airplane!
Marge Simpson,
,
,
Jacqueline Bouvier,"This is what a corn field looks like, honey."
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,You think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying?
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh well, Thank you, Doctor, you've changed my life!"
Dr. Zweig,"You know, Marge. We've really just begun to scratch the surface. There's still the far more serious problem of your husband."
Homer Simpson,That's okay. You don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. She can get on a plane. That's plenty.
Marge Simpson,"Thank you, Doctor. Whenever the wind whistles through the leaves I'll think Lowenstein, Lowenstein."
Dr. Zweig,My name is Zweig.
Marge Simpson,Lowenstein.
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this."
Homer Simpson,Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax.
,
Homer Simpson,That's just the engine powering up. That's just the engine struggling.
Homer Simpson,That's just a carp swimming around your ankles.
Marge Simpson,
,
Plumber,"Uh, looks like you got a leak."
Marge Simpson,Could you start fixing it pretty soon? The basement is getting awfully flooded. And I think the cat's down there.
Plumber,"Yeah, I probably won't be able to get the parts I need for two--three weeks. And that's if I order 'em today. Which I won't."
Marge Simpson,Oh dear.
Plumber,"Hm, emergency call. Gotta go."
Homer Simpson,What should we do until you get back?
Plumber,Put a pan down there.
Homer Simpson,"Aw, it didn't work."
,
,
Homer Simpson,Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.
Arnie Pye,This is Arnie Pie.
,
Arnie Pye,Looks like we got a little accident that's backing traffic up as far as this reporter can see.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Dad."
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how come you guys got such great parking places?"
Lenny Leonard,It's a secret.
Carl Carlson,Shh-- shut up.
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, will you guys help me fix my..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?"
Lenny Leonard,It's a secret.
Carl Carlson,Shut up.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you guys wanna go bowling tonight?"
Lenny Leonard,Nah. We're busy.
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, we got uh, things to do."
Homer Simpson,Like what?
Lenny Leonard,It's a secret.
Homer Simpson,Shut up.
,
Homer Simpson,I saved your life. That egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.
Homer Simpson,"So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy."
Bart Simpson,"A conspiracy, eh? You think they might be involved in the Kennedy assassination in some way?"
Homer Simpson,"I do... now. Anyway, I'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer. Don't start stalking people again. It's so illegal. Remember when you were stalking Charles Kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, something did."
Marge Simpson,I don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay. Have it your own way, Marge. I'll be back in a minute. I'm going outside. To stalk... ... Lenny and Carl."
,
Homer Simpson,All I have to do is follow the yellow drip road.
,
Lenny Leonard,There's our secret meeting place.
Carl Carlson,Yes. Let's go inside.
Lenny Leonard,Sounds good!
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hee hee hee! I can see everything. And they're none the wiser, hee hee hee."
,
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,An intruder!
Seymour Skinner,He will pay the ultimate price.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Yes, the ultimate price."
Moe Szyslak,Ged oudda heah!
,
Homer Simpson,I saw weird stuff in that place last night. Weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. And I want in.
Carl Carlson,We don't know what you're talkin' about Homer.
Lenny Leonard,And you can't join the Stonecutters because it's too exclusive.
Carl Carlson,Oh well. That was a real nice secret organization we had once.
Homer Simpson,"Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?"
Lenny Leonard,There are only two ways to gain membership. Be the son of a Stonecutter...
Homer Simpson,Next.
Lenny Leonard,Or save the life of a Stonecutter.
Lenny Leonard,"Forget it, Homer. While it has been established that eggs contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human bloodstream."
Homer Simpson,"So, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?"
Lenny Leonard,"You got it all wrong, Homer. It's not like that."
Homer Simpson,"You'd better run, egg!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Why don't people like me, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,Everyone likes you. You're a wonderful person.
Homer Simpson,Then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
Marge Simpson,"I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer."
Homer Simpson,It is. It's been happening to me all my life.
,
Boy,"Hey, Billy, hey, Joey, come on in. There's plenty of room. Sorry, not you, Homer."
7-Year-Old Homer,Why not?
7-YEAR-OLD-HOMER,But you let in Homer Glumplet.
Homer Glumpet,
Boy,"It says ""No Homers."" We're allowed to have one."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I felt so left out.
Marge Simpson,Kids can be so cruel.
Bart Simpson,"We can? Thanks, Mom."
Lisa Simpson,"Ow! Cut it out, Bart."
Bart Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,I'd give anything to get into the Stonecutters.
Lisa Simpson,"What do they do there, Dad?"
Grampa Simpson,I'm a member.
Homer Simpson,What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.
Lisa Simpson,"You don't know what they do there, do you?"
Homer Simpson,"Not as such, no."
Grampa Simpson,I'm a Stonecutter.
Bart Simpson,"Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?"
Homer Simpson,"Do I ever! It's five years later and I still think I'm a chicken. I'm a chicken, Marge."
Marge Simpson,"I know, I know."
HUGH,Certainly.
Bart Simpson,Maybe we should be listening to him now.
Grampa Simpson,I'm a member.
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Grampa Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,What?
Grampa Simpson,Huh?
Lisa Simpson,"You're a member of the Stonecutters, Grampa?"
Grampa Simpson,Oh sure. Let's see...
Grampa Simpson,"I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist... I'm the president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance for some reason... Ah, here it is. The Stonecutters."
Homer Simpson,This is it. My ticket in. They have to let me join if I'm the son of a member.
Homer Simpson,I'll take this Communist one too.
,
Homer Simpson,"Comin' through! Can't throw me out! My father's a member! I'm in, I'm in!"
Lenny Leonard,"Okay, okay, Homer. You're in. Just don't point that thing at me!"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks, Lenny. When am I gonna be initiated?"
Carl Carlson,As soon as Number One gets here.
Homer Simpson,"Number one? Ha ha. What kind of stupid wiener name is that? ""Hello, my name is Number One."" And so forth."
Lenny Leonard,"We call each other by number, not by name. Carl is number 14, I'm number 12. Burnsie is number 29."
Homer Simpson,You outrank Mr. Burns here?
Lenny Leonard,Sure. Watch. Hey 29! Get over here!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you, sir, may I have another?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder."
Homer Simpson,Is he the leader?
Moe Szyslak,Of this chapter. There are chapters all over the world. And it has been foretold that someday a Chosen One will...
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, I didn't ask for your life story."
Carl Carlson,Let the initiation begin.
Number One,"All Stonecutters must take the leap of faith. If you survive this five-story plunge, your character will be proven."
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,Happy landings.
Homer Simpson,I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.
Number One,"This ritual is called ""Crossing the Desert."""
Number One,"And this we call ""The Unblinking Eye."""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, have you ever noticed that the ""Crossing the Desert"" is a lot like ""The Unblinking Eye"" and it's exactly like ""The Wreck of the Hesperus""?"
Number One,And now the final ordeal: the paddling of the swollen ass... with paddles.
Homer Simpson,And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
Moe Szyslak,Um... I think he should have to take a different oath.
Number One,Everyone takes the same oath.
Number One,"Welcome to the club, Number 908. You have joined the sacred order of the Stonecutters, who since ancient times have split the rocks of ignorance that obscure the light of knowledge and truth. Now let's all get drunk and play Ping-Pong!"
Moe Szyslak,...cause he's already kind of heavy you know and...
,
Plumber,"Well to be honest, I never got around to ordering that part for ya, so uh, it's still gonna be a couple of weeks."
Homer Simpson,Oh really?
Plumber,Yes.
Homer Simpson,Really?
Plumber,"Yes, yes."
Homer Simpson,But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?
Plumber,"Well, I didn't realize you were a member."
,
Homer Simpson,"Heh heh heh! So long, suckers!"
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Same old space, huh, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,"Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door."
Homer Simpson,Heh heh heh heh. Sweet.
Homer Simpson,Jealous?
Lenny Leonard,Well... no. We've got the same chair.
Homer Simpson,You're jealous.
Lenny Leonard,Your membership pack.
Homer Simpson,What's this?
Lenny Leonard,You put that sticker on your car so you won't get any tickets. And this other one keeps paramedics from stealing your wallet while they're working on you.
Homer Simpson,Everything lasts forever.
Carl Carlson,"Oh, and don't bother calling nine one one anymore. Here's the real number."
Homer Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,I still don't believe all the founding fathers were Stonecutters.
Homer Simpson,That's because you trust your stupid school books. Here's what really happened at the signing of the Declaration of Independence...
Last Signer,... and a nation is born. Now let us party like 'twere seventeen ninety-nine!
Others,"Quaff, quaff, quaff, quaff ...!"
Innkeeper,"Please, sir. You're destroying my establishment."
Thomas Jefferson,"We just created the greatest democracy on earth, you low-life commoner."
Homer Simpson,You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, a man who called himself ""You Know Who"" just invited you to a secret ""wink wink"" at the ""you know what."" You certainly are popular now that you're a Stonecutter."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, AA meetings, beer night. It's wonderful, Marge. I've never felt so accepted in all my life. These people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which I joined."

Number One,"Thank you. Tonight we are here to commemorate our glorious society's 1500th Anniversary. And in honor of this momentous occasion, we're having ribs."
Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt, I could lose the respect of my beloved brethren."
Homer Simpson,The Black Panthers?
Number One,So let us rejoice and enjoy our meal in the shadow of the hallowed sacred parchment.
Stonecutters,
Lenny Leonard,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Lenny."
Stonecutters,/ This is just appalling and outrageous.
Homer Simpson,What? Did I miss something?
Stonecutters,
Stonecutters,"Oh God! / Oh Homer, no! / This is outrageous! / You can't do that! / No!"
Carl Carlson,You really are stupid.
Number One,And the official Stonecutter underwear too.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Please don't kick me out! This society is everything to me! Please give me another chance! I've learned my lesson.
Homer Simpson,I've learned my lesson!
Stonecutters,/ That's it!
Homer Simpson,Oh. Sorry.
Number One,"Homer Simpson: for your continuing and baffling desecration of our beloved sacred parchment, you are hereby banished from the Stonecutters forever. And as a final humiliation, you must walk home naked, dragging behind you the stone of shame."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,The mark!
Homer Simpson,Oh that. It's just a birth mark and I'll thank you not to stare.
Moe Szyslak,He's the chosen one!
Number One,"You are the Chosen One, whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory. Now to the top of Mount Springfield for the coronation! Remove the stone of shame!"
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!
Number One,Attach the stone of triumph.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Wow. Mental note. Don't overdo this.
Homer Simpson,Peek-a-boo!
,
Homer Simpson,I always wondered if there was a god. And now I know. There is. And it's me.
Marge Simpson,"You're not a god, Homer."
Lisa Simpson,"Remember, Dad. All glory is fleeting."
Homer Simpson,So?
Lisa Simpson,Beware the Ides of March.
Homer Simpson,No.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever."
Lisa Simpson,Don't you see? Getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
Homer Simpson,Remove the girl.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you're not with the Stonecutters now. There are no lackeys around to carry out your every..."
Stonecutters,Another strike for the Chosen One! Hurrah!
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Moe Szyslak,Well that's just an excellent break.
Stonecutters,Most assuredly. That's for sure. / Etc.
Carl Carlson,Absolutely.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,I'm out.
Carl Carlson,"No, no, Homer. You have a... royal... sampler."
Homer Simpson,"Oh I win again, don't I? Woo hoo."
Stonecutters,"""Good one, Chosen One."" Etc."

Carl Carlson,
Chief Wiggum,
Moe Szyslak,Run!
,
Seymour Skinner,The Grand Exalted Leader requests a moment of your time. Class dismissed.
School Kids,Yay!
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you were right. My happiness is fading."
Lisa Simpson,You're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
Homer Simpson,"What do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated."
Lisa Simpson,Well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
Homer Simpson,"Hm... I could help others. I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the Civil War ."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that doesn't help people."
Homer Simpson,Couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
,
Homer Simpson,"Brothers, brothers."
Stonecutters,
Marge Simpson,"Aw, Homie. You know, you are a member of a very exclusive club."
Homer Simpson,"Brothers, I've learned a wonderful lesson. Helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. So instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us Stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate."
Moe Szyslak,He's gone mad with power. Like that Albert Schweitzer guy.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, for the love of God! Somebody get the jaws of life!"
C. Montgomery Burns,
Kid #3,Higher! Higher!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh I'll give you higher, my filthy little urchin."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You've won this round, but..."
Woman,"Oh, thank you Mr. Simpson. It looks so much better. A beautiful sky-blue."
,
Homer Simpson,"You were right, Lisa. I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. And with my brothers, the Stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us."
,
Moe Szyslak,We gotta kill him.
Number One,"Take it easy, Moe. Let's hear from the Stonecutter World Council before we act too rashly."
Redenbacher,Kill him!
NICHOLSON,Kill him!
Mr. T,Kill the fool!
BUSH,"I'm afraid I have to disagree with Orville, Jack, and Mister. Can't we just do something to his voice box?"
Number One,"We might as well face the truth. As long as we're Stonecutters, he will control our lives."
Moe Szyslak,"Maybe... but maybe, we don't want to be Stonecutters no more."
,
Number One,Silence! I now call to order the first meeting of the Ancient Mystic Society of NoHomers.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, fellas. Can I join?"
Number One,"Sorry, no Homers."
Homer Glumpet,
Homer Simpson,

Homer Simpson,"Loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites."
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, kids, I miss my club."
Marge Simpson,"No. The family Simpson, which has just five members. And only two of those members have special rings."
Lisa Simpson,Yeah!
Marge Simpson,I meant our wedding rings.
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge you're right. The Simpson family is the best possible club I could belong to."

Homer Simpson,This club'd better be worth it.
Marge Simpson,"All right, all right. It's Lisa's turn."

Announcer,We now return to Knightboat: The Crime Solving Boat...
Knightboat's Partner,"Faster Knightboat, we've got to catch those starfish poachers."
,
Knightboat,Oh no! They're headed for land.
Knightboat's Partner,We'll never catch 'em now.
Knightboat,Incorrect. Look. A canal.
Homer Simpson,"Go Knightboat, go!"
,
Bart Simpson,Every week there's a canal.
Lisa Simpson,Or an inlet.
Bart Simpson,Or a fjord.
Homer Simpson,Quiet. I will not hear another word against the Boat.
Marge Simpson,"Okay, TV off. It's family time."
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, Knightboat. The crime solving boat."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you promised. One night of family time a week. Besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example."
Bart Simpson,"Says you, woman."
Marge Simpson,"All right, family time begins now."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,It was Bart.
Lisa Simpson,Why don't we all look at the photo album?
Homer Simpson,"So many memories. Aw, look... Knightboat."
Lisa Simpson,Aw.
Homer Simpson,Thanks honey. Bank shot.
Homer Simpson,And here's our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two.
Bart Simpson,Wow. Two.
Marge Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah two. Let's get to the baby pictures."
Homer Simpson,Moom.
Homer Simpson,That's exciting.
Bart Simpson,Oh please.
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Here's Bart sleeping... Here he is dozing... Here he is after a visit from the sandman... Ooh, here's nappy-time Bart... Here's a cute one, he's all tuckered out..."
Lisa Simpson,Why aren't there any pictures of Maggie?
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm glad you asked. It's actually a very interesting story."
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa you were the age Bart was several years ago."
Bart Simpson,"Get the camera ready, Bart very seepy."
Homer Simpson,Listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any TV show. It was a tumultuous time for our nation. The clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
Homer Simpson,"The Information Super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""Star Trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
,
Homer Simpson,I was at my work station when suddenly...
Villain,Attention American workers. Your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of free-lance terrorists.
Homer Simpson,Not on my shift.
,
Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't!
Homer Simpson,"Simpson ten, terrorists eight."
Marge Simpson,Homer! Tell the story right.
Homer Simpson,Okay.
,
Carl Carlson,"Homer, you should see a doctor. I don't think a healthy man could make that kind of a smell."
Waylon Smithers,"Your paychecks, gentlemen."
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! This is it! With this single glorious check, I'm finally completely out of debt."
Lisa Simpson,"Good aim, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Yes! With my bills paid off, I can finally quit this lousy job."
Lenny Leonard,"But Homer, how're you gonna make a living?"
Homer Simpson,Don't worry about Homer J. I've got a plan. A plan that'll fix you good.
Carl Carlson,"Hey, what did we do?"
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, that just slipped out. I'll miss ya."
,
Homer Simpson,"Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty. And since I quit, I can do anything I want."
C. Montgomery Burns,Is that so?
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, lovely desk. It would be too bad if someone, oh, I don't know... didn't use a coaster!!"
Homer Simpson,Such a nice tidy office. Maybe it's time you started living like a pig!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hope I haven't upset you... bongo head!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with rage... and island rhythms."
,
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, way to play the boss' head like a bongo, Homer."
Lenny Leonard,He's gettin' a pretty good sound outta that guy.
Homer Simpson,That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
Homer Simpson,"And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise."
,
Homer Simpson,And now the final phase of my plan.
Homer Simpson,"Hey Barney, any chance you can get me a job here?"
Barney Gumble,"Hey sure, Homer. I told you, my uncle owns the place."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job?"
Al,Sure.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Al,"Barney, you're fired."
Barney Gumble,Okay.
Al,"Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags. Oh, and a change of pants."
Homer Simpson,Why?
Al,"When it happens, you'll know."
,
Bart Simpson,You're a pin-monkey? Wow. Finally I don't have to be ashamed of my father's job.
Lisa Simpson,I think it's romantic. Throwing off the shackles of the workaday world and following a dream... of sorts.
Marge Simpson,I don't know if it's such a good idea. Can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge. I've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. There will be exactly enough money for you, me, Bart and Lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind..."
Homer Simpson,And only one of you kids can go to college.
Lisa Simpson,Fine.
Homer Simpson,That night your mother and I went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. We began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
Homer Simpson,Marge...
Marge Simpson,Homer...
Homer Simpson,I've got sand in my underpants.
Marge Simpson,Me too. Let's go home.
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Marge."
Marge Simpson,"I love you too, Homie."
Homer Simpson,Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.
Marge Simpson,
Sperm #1,
Sperm #2,
"SPERM #3, #4, & #5",
Sperm #40012,Woo hoo!
Marge Simpson,Did you have to be so graphic?
Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. They pave the way for this kind of filth in school."
Lisa Simpson,"So Dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?"
Homer Simpson,"Actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. At that time, I had no idea Maggie even existed."
Lisa Simpson,Daaad!
Homer Simpson,Hi Maggie.
Homer Simpson,"So anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair."
,
Homer Simpson,The next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... bowling fresh.
Homer Simpson,Mmm... urinal fresh.
Kent Brockman,In science: dead last.
Al,"Homer, did you polish your head in the ""Shine-O Ball-O?"""
Homer Simpson,No.
Al,Okay then.
Homer Simpson,"...I slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down."
Homer Simpson,"I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well."
Customers,"Hey, great job, Homer. / Thanks a lot./ You're the best."
Homer Simpson,I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Congratulations Mrs. Simpson, you're pregnant."
Marge Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Am I to take it that this is... an unwanted pregnancy?
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, you know, a healthy baby can bring upwards of sixty-thousand dollars."
Marge Simpson,What?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Of course, that was just a test. Had you reacted differently, why you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test."
,
Marge Simpson,So in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.
Bart Simpson,"Been there, done that."
Lisa Simpson,I hope it's a girl.
Bart Simpson,"You know nothin' about genetics, Lis. It goes boy, girl, boy, girl."
Lisa Simpson,"You're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
Marge Simpson,Why do you say that?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, you've been in my room for about four hours now."
Marge Simpson,"Hey, I'm just hangin'."
Marge Simpson,"Homie, I--"
Homer Simpson,"Can't talk, praying. Dear Lord, the gods have been good to me and I am thankful. For the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. What are all these presents? It looks like you're ""showering"" Marge with gifts."
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was my major."
Homer Simpson,"So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done."
,
Selma Bouvier,"Oogie boogie, boogie, boogie, boo,"
Marge Simpson,"I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. Until then please, keep this to yourselves."
Patty Bouvier,"If he found out now it would probably destroy him, huh?"
Marge Simpson,Oh yes.
Selma Bouvier,Gotta go.
Marge Simpson,"Wait a minute, wait, I know that look. Now promise you won't tell Homer."
Selma Bouvier,"Oh, we promise we won't tell... Homer."
,
Patty Bouvier,"Hello, is this A. Aaronson? It might interest you to know that Marge Simpson is pregnant again..."
Patty Bouvier,"Just thought you'd like to know, Mr. Zowkowski."
Patty Bouvier,There. Aaronson and Zowkowski are the two biggest gossips in town. In an hour everyone will know.
,
Homer Simpson,Ah... another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. That's nice work, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Thank you. Thank you very much. It is nice work.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy. Congratulations, sir."
Homer Simpson,"It's true, the bundle is little. But I'm not in it for the money."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey Homer, way to get Marge pregnant. Heh, heh, heh."
Homer Simpson,"This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I do enjoy working at the bowling alley."
,
All,Surprise! Baby Shower!
Marge Simpson,"Baby shower?! You know I haven't told Homer yet, and he'll be home any minute."
Selma Bouvier,Oh really.
Homer Simpson,Man. It's windy as hell out there.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. With little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. Well... I'll be in the tub."
Maude Flanders,"By the way, congratulations on your new job, Homer."
Homer Simpson,New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!
Bart Simpson,"Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?"
Homer Simpson,Oh just that one time.
Marge Simpson,"Actually, when I was about to have Bart..."
Homer Simpson,You're pregnant?!
Marge Simpson,And then when I told him about Lisa...
Homer Simpson,You're pregnant again?!
Homer Simpson,"Well who wouldn't be upset? That new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! Hey, where're you going?"
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you can't expect a person to sit for thirty minutes straight."
Lisa Simpson,I'm gonna get a snack and maybe go to the bathroom.
Marge Simpson,"I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think about products I might like to purchase."
Marge Simpson,"Ooh, I don't have that."
Homer Simpson,You're pregnant! We're gonna have to have a baby! All our financial plans are ruined. We're doomed! Doomed I tells ya!
Marge Simpson,Homer! Let your father tell the story.
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Bart Simpson,"Okay, but I know funny."
Homer Simpson,Anyhoo...
Homer Simpson,We're doomed!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you had a head."
Homer Simpson,Check.
Marge Simpson,And your bottom was a little bigger.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, a raise! I've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. But I'm damn good at this one. That's it! I'm gonna march right up to Al and say..."
,
Homer Simpson,"Steve -- I mean Al, I think I deserve a raise."
Al,"Well, you're a hard worker and I'd like to give you a raise, but the alley just ain't doin' enough business to pay that kind of money."
Legs,"When he's done in there, I gotta go."
Homer Simpson,How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?
Al,"Well yeah, but how--"
,
Homer Simpson,Of course!
,
Homer Simpson,Bowling! Bowling here! Come bowl now! Get yer bowling! Who's ready?! Bowling!
Lisa Simpson,Mom! Make Dad tell the story right.
Marge Simpson,That's what really happened.
Lisa Simpson,Oh.
Homer Simpson,"My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done."
Al,"You did a great job Homer, and I'm really gonna miss you. The place has never been cleaner, and the way you kept the young people away... That was beautiful."
Various Patrons,
Al,"Anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little goin' away thing."
Homer Simpson,"This was the happiest time of my life. I'll never forget you guys. Especially you, Joey."
Joey,"See ya 'round, Mr. Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Joey. We'll make it to California some day."
Joey,"Sure we will, Mr. Homer. Sure we will."
Customer #1,"It's gonna be sad around here without you, Homer."
Customer #1,"Boy, this is depressing."
Customer #2,"Hey, I know what would cheer us up... Bowling!"
Everyone,
Everyone,
Homer Simpson,I needed more money to support my growing family. And there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.
Guard,Uh-oh. Acid rain again.
,
Receptionist,"Yes, are you a new applicant?"
Homer Simpson,"Actually, I quit and I came to get my job back."
Receptionist,Through there.
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, come crawling back, eh?"
Homer Simpson,Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
,
Homer Simpson,Thanks for giving me my old job back.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm afraid it's not that simple. As punishment for your desertion, it's company policy to give you the plague."
Waylon Smithers,"Uh sir, that's the plaque."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah yes, the special demotivational plaque, to break what's left of your spirit. Because, you see, you're here forever."
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Don't forget, you're here forever."""
,
Homer Simpson,I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.
Homer Simpson,"Hi honey, how are you?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, actually -"
Homer Simpson,I can't go on with this charade any longer. I hate my job. I hate my life. And ever since I found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
Marge Simpson,My contractions started an hour ago.
Homer Simpson,"It's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, Marge."
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,This is incredible! It's God's most wondrous miracle!
Nurse,"Sir, I think your wife wants to hold the baby."
Mayor Joe Quimby,My wife? Where?! Where?!
Doctor,Congratulations! It's a boy!
Captain Horatio McCallister,Argh -- you're truly the catch of the day!
Homer Simpson,"It's wonderful! It's magical! Oh boy, here it comes - another mouth."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,One more push should do it.
Homer Simpson,Marvelous.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. You have a beautiful, healthy baby."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, I think someone is saying hello."
Homer Simpson,Hello. Aw. It's a boy... And what a boy.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Uh, that's the umbilical cord. It's a girl."
Homer Simpson,"A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Come on Marge, show a little enthusiasm."
Lisa Simpson,"So, you loved her right from the start."
Homer Simpson,Absolutely.
Bart Simpson,Then why no pictures?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up."
,
,
Seymour Skinner,"And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever, our grand finale! The launching of a weather balloon."
Bart Simpson,Yay! Go weather balloon! Hurrah for science! Woo!
Seymour Skinner,"Hurrah for science, woo? I can't say I approve of the woo, but the hurrah was quite heartening. Release the balloon."
Nerds,Yayyyy!
Kids,
Seymour Skinner,Nooooooo!
Bart Simpson,I don't think I really captured the eyes.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, if you have a failing, it's that you're always demanding perfection. If you have a failing."
Seymour Skinner,Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn fractions!
Kids,Yayyy!
Seymour Skinner,"Careful children, that's my car."
Seymour Skinner,Destroy that balloon.
Groundskeeper Willie,Aye.
,
Pilot,"Tango Fourteen, we're being fired at. I'm gettin' an exact ID on the bogie now."
Pilot,Iraqis again. Launching Sidewinder missile.
,
Pilot,Missed him. Launching second Sidewinder missile.
,
Pilot,This is what happens when you cut money out of the military and put it into health care.
Pilot #2,"It's a good program. Just give it a chance, that's all I ask."
Seymour Skinner,It won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium. Curse Pierre Jules Cesar Janssen! Now to find out who did this.
Seymour Skinner,Bart? Empty your pockets.
Bart Simpson,And you've never found anything?
Bart Simpson,"Empty my pockets you say? Well, certainly, but I fail to see how..."
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm... blueprints of the dummy, ... notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner: ""Buttzilla."""
Bart Simpson,"Race you to Utah, Milhouse."
Milhouse Van Houten,Okay.
Seymour Skinner,"I am going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time."
Seymour Skinner,"Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning."
Bart Simpson,There's a four-thirty in the morning now?
,
Radio Announcer,"Top of the hour. Time for the morning news. But, of course, there is no news yet. Everyone's still asleep. In their comfy, comfy beds. Good night everybody."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, will you make me breakfast?"
Marge Simpson,There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. Just rinse it good...
Small Boy,"Come home, Lassie! Here boy! C'mon girl! Atta boy!"
Bart Simpson,Still dark. Better use the generator.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, there's nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers, paying attention... Science has it all!"
Bart Simpson,Is that the telescope we're gonna be looking through?
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, but you won't be looking through it. I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. There are all the constellations you've heard so much about."
Seymour Skinner,There's Orion... the Swan...the chariot race...
Bart Simpson,Why don't they look anything like their names?
Seymour Skinner,"Well, you do have to use your imagination. Look, there's the Three Wise Men."
Bart Simpson,Who names these things anyway?
Seymour Skinner,Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I could find something that would be named after me.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway... that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not."
Bart Simpson,So what am I supposed to do exactly?
Seymour Skinner,"Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-two minutes declination... No sighting."
Bart Simpson,Uh huh.
Seymour Skinner,"Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-three minutes declination... No sighting."
Bart Simpson,Uh huh.
Seymour Skinner,"Six hours, nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees fifty-eight minutes declination... No sighting. Did you get that one, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Hell no.
Seymour Skinner,Good... My stars! Give me the phone! Quick!
,
Female Astronomer,Check out six-nineteen-fourteen-fifty-nine.
,
Seymour Skinner,"No, no there's no need for that... it's already named after me."
Seymour Skinner,"It's coming pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole morning's work."
Bart Simpson,Woo! All hands on deck! Pirates off the port bow! Hey!
Bart Simpson,"Observatory? This is Bart Simpson. I see something in the sky at... four, twelve, eight, and the last number is seven."
Seymour Skinner,"Ah got you, my rumpy doppelganger."
Seymour Skinner,I've got it! What are you doing? Give me that phone.
,
Female Astronomer,"Congratulations, Bart. You've just discovered a comet."
,
Seymour Skinner,NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
Seymour Skinner,NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
Seymour Skinner,NOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
Homer Simpson,...And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
Lisa Simpson,"Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, except I forgot to go to work."
Marge Simpson,"What did you do today, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,What didn't I do.
Marge Simpson,Boy Discovers Comet.
Lisa Simpson,What!?
Marge Simpson,"""A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as 'The Bart Simpson Comet.'"" Oh honey, I'm so proud of you."
Bart Simpson,"But then, you've always been proud of me."
Marge Simpson,Yes.
,
Ham,"Won't you join us, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Uh... I guess so.
Database,"As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a comet, we're very proud to make you a member of our very select group. Welcome to SuperFriends!"
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Nerds,"Welcome, SuperFriend!"
Ham,"I am called ""Ham,"" since I enjoy ham radio. This is ""E-Mail,"" ""Cosine,"" ""Report Card,"" ""Database"" and ""Lisa"". Your nickname will be ""Cosmos."""
Bart Simpson,Well I'm done eating. Goodbye.
Nerds,Goodbye Cosmos! / Bye-bye!
Database,Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.
Bart Simpson,There it is right there.
Database,"I make it a point never to turn my head unless I expect to see something, Bart. Naturally we can't see your comet in broad daylight and without a telescope."
Bart Simpson,But you don't need a stupid telescope. It's right there.
E-Mail,Oh no no no no! This isn't right at all!
Database,It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Lisa Simpson,"Don't you realize what's happening, Bart? Your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed."
Bart Simpson,I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet Lisa. You've always been petty and small. Right from the beginning.
Report Card,We must alert the proper authorities.
E-Mail,To the observatory!
,
SUPERFRIENDS,We are the SuperFriends...
Bart Simpson,"Hey, shut up."
Male Astronomer,Dear God.
Female Astronomer,"Warren, we've talked about you hogging the eyepiece."
,
Grampa Simpson,Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle. Ain't been blown for nigh on to three years.
Jasper Beardly,Trouble a brewin'.
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Fellow citizens, when I learned about the impending crisis, I caught the very next plane to Springfeld - field."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"First of all, yes, there is a comet in the sky, and yes, it is going to hit Springfield."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"You uh, don't need to applaud that. Now, here's what we think the impact might look like. Show them, Jerry."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh dear God, no!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,Fortunately we have a plan. Professor Frink?
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Good evening, ladies and..."
Panicked Man,Quit stalling! What's the plan?!
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Alright, just take your seat, just take your seat."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Now, working with former Carter Administration officials and military men who were forced into early retirement for various reasons, which we won't go into here , we have planned this defense for the city."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"As the comet hurtles toward the city, our rocket will intercept it and blow it to smithereens."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, dear God, no!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,...and that will be the end of Mr. Comet.
Townspeople,Yay! / We're saved! / Etc.
Townspeople,
,
Homer Simpson,Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed. Didn't you hear what the guy in the building said?
Lisa Simpson,"But, Dad, don't you think..."
Congressman #1,Then it is unanimous. We are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of...
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?"
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad, I don't think..."
Homer Simpson,There's that word again.
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what if this doesn't work?"
Homer Simpson,"Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, the plan!"
Homer Simpson,"I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
Bart Simpson,Dad!
Homer Simpson,"So anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
Lisa Simpson,"Daaad, they're firing the rocket!"
Homer Simpson,All right!
Townspeople,YAYYYY!
Townspeople,Gllllll.
Lisa Simpson,It blew up the bridge!
Bart Simpson,We're doomed!
Homer Simpson,It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"It's all over, people! We don't have a prayer!"
Kent Brockman,"And, like Icarus, the rocket foolishly soared too high and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism, leaving us with some... six hours to live. So! Let's go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town, with Arnie Pye and ""Arnie In The Sky."""
Arnie Pye,"With the bridge gone, and the airport unfortunately on the other side of the bridge, a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars."
Arnie Pye,"It's a silent testament to the ""never give up"" and ""never think things out"" spirit of our citizens."
Kent Brockman,"With our utter annihilation imminent, our Federal Government has snapped into action. We go live now via satellite to the floor of the United States Congress ..."
,
,
Lisa Simpson,It's a pony.
Congressman #2,"Wait a second, I want to tack on a rider to that bill. Thirty million dollars of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts."
Congressman #1,All in favor of the amended Springfield-slash-Pervert bill?
Congress,Boo!
Congressman #1,Bill defeated.
Kent Brockman,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. Democracy simply doesn't work. Now, over the years, a newsman learns a number of things that, for one reason or another, he just cannot report. It doesn't seem to matter now, so... the following people are gay."
Marge Simpson,Turn it off.
Homer Simpson,Just a second.
Homer Simpson,"What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right."
Homer Simpson,"Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow."
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter."
Lisa Simpson,We have a bomb shelter?
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson takes care of his family.
,
Homer Simpson,Flanders! Open up!
Ned Flanders,"Hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. What can I do you for?"
Homer Simpson,Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Ned Flanders,"I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families."
Homer Simpson,No deal. Out.
Marge Simpson,"Get in the shelter, Homer."
,
Marge Simpson,One more hour.
Homer Simpson,An hour! I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet?
Homer Simpson,THERE it is.
Ned Flanders,"Well, Howdilly doodilly neighbors. Shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?"
Moe Szyslak,We haven't got sheltereenees. We want in yours.
Ned Flanders,"Well sorry, the shelter's kinda full."
Moe Szyslak,"Really? Oh. Well, we'll just go off someplace and die then. Thanks."
Ned Flanders,Wait!
Ned Flanders,"I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
Townspeople,
Krusty the Clown,All right!
Homer Simpson,I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.
Lisa Simpson,"I'd get out, but I don't know where I am."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, somebody's touching me."
Seymour Skinner,I am.
Barney Gumble,"Oh, okay."
Krusty the Clown,"Okay, okay, let's figure out who should stay. Let's see... the world of the future will need laughter, so I'm in."
Moe Szyslak,"And it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. Um, and someone will have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah. I can do that."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Okay, let's start again. We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip -- that's Mrs. Lovejoy..."
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders."
Homer Simpson,"I'm terribly sorry. Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. So let's kick Flanders out. Sorry."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, sounds fair. Toodle-oo, everybody. I'll, I'll scream when the comet gets here."
Maude Flanders,"Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddy."
Ned Flanders,"No, sweetheart, you stay here because--"
Maude Flanders,Okay.
Ned Flanders,"I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in."
Todd Flanders,"Okay, Dad."
Ned Flanders,Okay.
Ned Flanders,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE / THE FUTURE'S NOT OURS TO SEE..."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I got an idea. We can play a game to pass the time. Uh, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and uh, you all try to guess what it is."
Chief Wiggum,It's a pig!
Bart Simpson,"It's a cow, man."

Krusty the Clown,"No, it's a goat. You know, one of them lady goats."
Selma Bouvier,There are no lady goats. A lady goat is a sheep.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I believe she's right.
Otto Mann,You're crazy.
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arrr, what's it to ya?"
Otto Mann,What's it to me?
Marge Simpson,"Stop it, stop it. Can't you see this barnyard noise guessing game is tearing us apart?!"
Ned Flanders,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE..."
Marge Simpson,"Say Moe, was it a duck?"
Homer Simpson,"No, no! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it, stop it! I can't take this anymore. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. Especially his children. I'm goin' out there."
Homer Simpson,And it was a baby ox.
Moe Szyslak,"He's right, ya know."
Seymour Skinner,About the ox?
Moe Szyslak,"About everything, dammit! Hey, Homer, wait up! I wanna die too!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"If you are going, I'm going."
Barney Gumble,Me too.
Ned Flanders,"WHEN I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL / I ASKED MY MOTHER WHAT WILL I BE / WILL I BE PRETTY, WILL I BE RICH? / HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID TO ME..."
Townspeople,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE / THE FUTURE'S NOT OURS TO SEE, QUE SERA, SER--"
Mayor Joe Quimby,RUN!
,
Marge Simpson,Look!
Lisa Simpson,It's breaking up!
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Lisa Simpson,We're saved!
Townspeople,Yay!
Patty Bouvier,Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life.
Moe Szyslak,Let's go burn down the observatory so this'll never happen again.
,
Lisa Simpson,I can't believe that extra thick layer of pollution that I've actually picketed against is what burned up the comet.
Bart Simpson,What's really amazing is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen.
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, dad was right."
Homer Simpson,"I know kids, I'm scared too."
,
,
Lisa Simpson,When Krusty wants to he can still blow 'em away.
Bart Simpson,"Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle and make it funny."
,
Krusty the Clown,"See you tomorrow, kids. But before I go I'd just like to say..."
,
Krusty the Clown,"Ahh, there's nothing better than a cigarette, UNLESS it's a cigarette lit with a $100 bill."
Krusty the Clown,"Put five thousand bucks on the Lakers... Hire Kenny G to play for me in the elevator... My house is dirty, buy me a clean one..."
,
Accountant,"Krusty, as your accountant, I must warn you you're spending too much mon--"
Krusty the Clown,Did you send those thousand roses to Bea Arthur's grave?
Accountant,"Yes, but she's still..."
Krusty the Clown,I don't want to hear the end of any sentences...
Secretary,George Carlin on three.
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah? Lawsuit? Oh, come on! My ""Seven words you can't say on TV"" bit was entirely different from your ""Seven words you can't say on TV"" bit. So I'm a thief, am I? Well exCUSE MEEEEEEEEE!"
Krusty the Clown,Give him ten grand.
Secretary,Steve Martin on four.
Krusty the Clown,Ten grand.
Fat Tony,"Krusty, in regards to the large wager you made on yesterday's horse race..."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, come on. How about letting me go double or nothing on the big opera tonight?"
Fat Tony,Who do you like?
Krusty the Clown,The tenor.
Fat Tony,Okay. But we're only letting the bet ride because you crack us so consistently... up.
Accountant,"You've got to stop blowing your money like this, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,No can do.
Accountant,"And those ridiculous bets you make! Gambling is the finest thing a person can do, if he's good at it. But you haven't won anything in months."
Krusty the Clown,So I'll just make some more money. Crank out some cheesy merchandise.
Homer Simpson,I am holding still. I am squirming.
,
Accountant,"But you've already merchandized everything: Krusty's Monopoly Game,... the Krusty Krowd Kontrol Barrier. Nothing is selling anymore. Not even your new ""Lady Krusty"" line."
Krusty the Clown,But our info-mercials are running twenty-four hours a day.
Johnny Unitas,"So, what do you think of the Lady Krusty Moustache Removal System now, Angelique?"
Angelique,"It's Krusterific, Johnny Unitas, but is my upper lip supposed to bleed like this?"
Johnny Unitas,Probably.
Accountant,"At this rate you'll be broke in a month. The only thing left to do is to open a clown college and train some ""regional"" Krustys."
Krusty the Clown,"You mean like that bozo, Bonko the Clown?"
Accountant,Exactly.
Krusty the Clown,"Forget it. I'll just cut back on the condor egg omelettes. Mmmm, a couple of those would be tasty right now."
Accountant,I'll found the college tomorrow.
,
Homer Simpson,It must be the first of the month! New billboard day!
Transport Driver,Finders keepers.
Homer Simpson,"""This year give her English Muffins."" Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard."
Homer Simpson,Best in the West. It rhymes.
Homer Simpson,Clown college? You can't eat that.
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I got everything I was supposed to get. I'm not going to enroll in that clown college though. That advertisement had no effect on me whatsoever."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Homer. The section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire."
Homer Simpson,Clowns are funny.
,
Lisa Simpson,Mom?
Marge Simpson,I think I'll have some wine.
Homer Simpson,Marge.
Marge Simpson,"Yes, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!
Bart Simpson,I don't think any of us expected him to say that.
Homer Simpson,Hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
Marge Simpson,"Hold still, Homer. Don't squirm."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you can't just go around pretending to be Krusty. It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as I know."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as Tom Bosley. But Krusty!"
Homer Simpson,You weren't complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.
Bart Simpson,What's a Chachi?
,
,
Krusty the Clown,"All right. Now, there can only be one Krusty in each territory, so I hope this works out. Tell me where you're from."
Georgian,Georgia.
Texan,Texas.
2nd Texan,Uh... Brooklyn.
Russian,Russia.
New Englander,New Hampshire.
Homer Simpson,Homer.
Krusty the Clown,"Okay, we'll start off with the baggy p...wha?"
Krusty the Clown,Those are supposed to be baggy pants. Baggy!
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life."
Krusty the Clown,"Okay, memorize these funny place names. Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga, Seattle..."
Homer Simpson,Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...
Krusty the Clown,"And now everybody's favorite, the ""spin cycle fantastique"" trick. It's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool."
Homer Simpson,"Steady, steady..."
Krusty the Clown,"Now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? Wrong."
Homer Simpson,Kill wealthy dowager.
Krusty the Clown,"Uh, burn that seat."
Krusty the Clown,"These Krusty brand balloons are three bucks each, but get a cheap one and what happens? It goes off, takes out the eyeballs of every kid in the room. What's that gonna cost yA? Hey Bill, what did that cost us?"
,
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Wow. I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad."
Lisa Simpson,"If there has to be a bastardized version of Krusty, I'm glad it's you."
Krusty the Clown,"Welcome to the noble family of skilled Krustaceans. You will now go back to your hometowns and do kids' parties, swap meets, and all the other piddling crap I wouldn't touch with a ten foot clown pole. Now come and get your cat skins -- Uh, I mean sheep skins."
Student,This is the happiest day of my life. A-YAH-ha.
Homer Simpson,Got it! No shock for me .
Krusty the Clown,Oh yeah?
Homer Simpson,

Manager,"And now, to help introduce our fantastic new burger, the one with ketchup, here he is, coming in by parachute.... Krusty the Klown!"
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Lord save me.
Kid In Crowd,It's the Krusty Burglar!
Homer Simpson,Omigod! He's stealing all the burgers! Why you little - I've got you!
Manager,"Homer, it's all just an act."
Kid In Crowd,Stop! Stop! He's already dead!
Manager,Krusty the Clown everybody!
Krusty Burglar,Please look at my Medic Alert bracelet.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey."
Homer Simpson,"And - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and Ah. Here's your giraffe, little girl."
Ralph Wiggum,I'm a boy.
Homer Simpson,That's the spirit. Never give up.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I guess you're pretty impressed, huh Bart? My dad got Krusty the Klown to personally appear at my party."
Bart Simpson,I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house.
Milhouse Van Houten,"I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty big wheel down at the cracker factory."
Kirk Van Houten,"Uh, it's not 5:30 yet."
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, nice threads."
Homer Simpson,"I'm beat, and after work I've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the Ace Awards."
Lenny Leonard,"Wow, jiffy lube."
Grampa Simpson,You've stolen my soul.
Carl Carlson,"Boy, you're really running yourself ragged."
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. When I started this clown thing I thought it would be nothing but glory. You know, the glory of being a clown? I tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when I see the smiles on their little faces, I just know they're getting ready to jab me with something."
,
Dick Cavett,"Well my time's almost up here, so uh, I'd just like to say I know Woody Allen."
Homer Simpson,"And now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""Starsky and Hutches."""
Announcer,"Accepting the award is the son of the guy who played ""Huggy Bear."""
Dick Cavett,"Let's walk and talk. I ah, I have some wonderful stories about other famous people that include me in some way."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo."
Dick Cavett,Hey! Me too! We can go together.
Homer Simpson,"Uh... no. I'm going a different way than you, Dick."
Dick Cavett,"Your churlish attitude reminds me of the time I was having dinner with Groucho, and..."
Homer Simpson,"Look, you're gonna be having dinner with Groucho tonight if you don't beat it."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Being a clown sucks. You get kicked by kids, bit by dogs, and admired by the elderly. Who am I clowning? I have no business being a clown. I'm leaving the clowning business to all the other clowns in the clowning business."
Homer Simpson,Oh no.
Chief Wiggum,"Well, well, well ""Velocity Boy,"" I am gonna give you the biggest ticket you... Hey! Krusty!"
Homer Simpson,I'm not Krusty.
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, to think I was going to give you a ticket! Krusty the Klown!"
Homer Simpson,I am not Krusty.
Chief Wiggum,"Hey Krusty, Krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set those beavers loose in that pine furniture store? Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, he didn't give me a ticket! This is an intriguing development."
,
Homer Simpson,"You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"How could I charge full price to the man whose lust for filthy magazines kept me in business during that first shaky year? By the way, here is your new issue of ""Gigantic Asses."""
,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, Marge, this will work. They'll think I'm Krusty and give us free stuff. I've been gettin' free stuff all day. Look at this swell bucket of house paint."
Homer Simpson,Look at it.
Marge Simpson,I'm not saying it won't work. I'm just saying it's dishonest.
Homer Simpson,"Well if we agree, then why are we arguing?"
,
Luigi,"Hey, Krusty! Hey, ooh, beautiful date tonight! And such lovely children you have now!"
Bart Simpson,I'm more striking than lovely.
Luigi,You come with me. Come with Liugi.
Luigi,You don't want to sit with the rest of this scum.
Luigi,I only consider you scum compared to Krusty.
Luigi,"Yeah, you see how you're scum."
,
Accountant,Let me get this straight. You took all the money you made franchising your name and bet it AGAINST the Harlem Globetrotters?
Krusty the Clown,I thought the Generals were due.
Krusty the Clown,He's spinning the ball on his finger! Just take it! Take the ball!
Krusty the Clown,That game was fixed. They were using a freakin' ladder for god's sake!
Fat Tony,I am afraid the time has come for you to pay us.
Krusty the Clown,"Look, I'm cleaned out. Just take the clown college."
Fat Tony,We have already taken it.
,
Gangster,"Kids have a lot of money these days, so, after you finish your performance, you might consider robbing 'em."
Krusty the Clown,"Look, what can I tell ya? You can't get blood from a turnip. You wanna kill me? Go ahead and kill me."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey! Hey! All right, okay, already. Look, we can talk this over."
Fat Tony,No more talk. It is time for us to take you for a ride.
Krusty the Clown,Mind if I go to the bathroom first?
Fat Tony,I see no harm in that.
Fat Tony,"Okay, wherever Krusty's gone, we'll find him. Legs, you check out the East Side. Louie, Rome and Budapest. Tell the boys I want a total world search."
Louie,"Right, Boss."
Homer Simpson,I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty!
Fat Tony,Cancel the world search.
,
Homer Simpson,"I want everything that's coming to Krusty the clown, which is me... Krusty."
Louie,Hey! It's Krusty all right. Should I shoot him gangland-style or execution-style?
Fat Tony,Listen to your heart.
Salesman,"Well, I can't give you the car, Krusty... but I can let you have this little number for practically nothing. Only thirty-eight thousand."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what are these holes?"
Salesman,These are speed holes. They make the car go faster.
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Speed holes.
Salesman,You want my advice? I think you should buy this car.
Fat Tony,We need more ammo. Let's go to Big five.
,
,
Plastic Surgeon,"Krusty, your plastic surgery is complete. Now when I remove the bandages don't be alarmed by the total stranger staring back at you."
Krusty the Clown,"I look exactly the same, you moron!"
Plastic Surgeon,"Nonsense Krusty, you look at least ten years younger. Plus I did your breasts."
Krusty the Clown,"Does anyone hear me complaining about the breasts? Ah, what's the use in hiding? I gotta go back to Springfield and face the music. Can you loan me bus fare?"
Krusty the Clown,Hey hey hey hey hey.
,
Ned Flanders,"Whatcha diddily doin', neighbor?"
Homer Simpson,Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.
Ned Flanders,Is that so? Well gee... maybe the old FlandersMobile could use a...
Ned Flanders,Lucky I always keep a Bible close to my heart.
Ned Flanders,Lucky I was wearing an extra large piece of the True Cross today. I think I'll go inside.
Homer Simpson,What keeps doin' that?
Fat Tony,I told you we should've bought more than three bullets. Let's just grab him.
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,But wait. You can't kill me for being Krusty. I'm not him. I'm Homer Simpson.
Fat Tony,The same Homer Simpson who crashed his car through the wall of our club?
Homer Simpson,Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.
Legs,The same Barney Gumbel who keeps taking pictures of my sister?
Homer Simpson,"Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi."
Louie,The same Joe Valachi who squealed to the Senate Committee about organized crime?
,
Homer Simpson,Benedict Arnold!
Legs,The same Benedict Arnold who plotted to surrender West Point to the hated British?
Homer Simpson,
Don Vitorio,"I am so glad I had a chance to meet you before we did this, Krusty, because I am a great-a fan. Don Vittorio Dimaggio."
Homer Simpson,Krusty the clown.
Don Vitorio,"Sorry, I have to do this, Krusty."
Don Vitorio,"I cannot do it. To murder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime. Tell you what, Krusty. Do for me my favorite trick where you ride the little bike through the loop, and I will let you live."
Homer Simpson,"But, I've never been able to do the..."
Homer Simpson,How 'bout if I just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,I'll never be able to do this trick... never.
Don Vitorio,Go! Go!
Homer Simpson,Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!
Don Vitorio,The fact that you did not do the trick well is the biggest insult of all.
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, guys, I came to uh... Uh, you've got a deadly game of cat and mouse goin'. I'll come back."
Legs,I'm seeing double here. Four Krustys.
Bart Simpson,Payroll. Burt Stanton speaking.
Homer Simpson,Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, that's what I did."
Don Vitorio,My apologies to you. I almost made a grievous error.
Don Vitorio,"Goodbye, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,Wait! He can't kill anybody if he doesn't know which one's the real Krusty!
Don Vitorio,I am confused.
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh, good one, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,Oh crap.
Don Vitorio,"Because of that disrespectful display, I shall now kill both of you... Unless... you both go through the loop. Together."
Krusty the Clown,"I can't see, you idiot! Take your hands off my eyes!"
Krusty the Clown,Uh-ho.
Don Vitorio,"Without the loop, it is nothing."
Homer Simpson,Ta-Da!
Gangsters,Yayyyyy Krustys!
Don Vitorio,Grazie. Grazie. You have brought great joy to this old Italian stereotype.
Legs,"No, no, Don Vittorio, you're not."
Don Vitorio,"Yes I am. I know it. I am. Anyway, thank-a you, Krusty."
Krusty the Clown,"You're welcome. So, we're even now, huh?"
Don Vitorio,No. We just won't kill you. But you still owe us the money. Forty-eight dollars.
Krusty the Clown,Here's fifty.
Don Vitorio,"And two, your change. And we thank you."
Bart Simpson,"Go, toothpaste! Go! Move your pasty white butt!"
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, shampoo! You can do it!"
Lisa Simpson,Yay! I won your stupid bathroom products race!
,
Bart Simpson,No fair! You only won 'cause you had the inside track! If the water was spinning the other way--
Lisa Simpson,"It never spins the other way. In the Northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. It's called the Coriolis effect."
Bart Simpson,"No way. Water doesn't obey your ""rules."" It goes where it wants. Like me, babe."
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, Bart. Why don't you try it and see?"
Bart Simpson,"I know I've seen it go the other way. Ah, faithful toilet. You'll prove me right."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I'm a singing in the show... Hot! Yeow! Cold! Ow! Hot! Cold! Hot! Ow! Who's! Doing! That?!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart! Use the plunger!"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern Hemisphere."
Bart Simpson,What the hell is the Southern Hemisphere?
Lisa Simpson,Haven't you ever looked at your globe?
Lisa Simpson,"See, the Southern Hemisphere is made up of everything below the Equa... this line."
Bart Simpson,"Hmm, so down there in, say, Argentina or Rand-McNally all their water runs backwards?"
Lisa Simpson,"Uh-huh. In fact, in Rand-McNally, they wear hats on their feet, and hamburgers eat people."
Bart Simpson,Cool.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Southern Hemisphere? Which way does the water go in your toilet?"
Scientist,Just a minute. I'll check.
Second Scientist,"Aw, nuts."
,
Translator,Please to repeat again and I will translating for the El Presidente.
Bart Simpson,Which way does the water turn in your toilet?
Translator,Dice que el curso estÃ¡ cambiando!
Dictator,Ay! Carumba! Los insurgentes ya van a capturar la capital! Necesito huir!
,
Bart Simpson,I can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere!

Hitler,Eine minuten! Eine minuten!

Elderly Nazi,"Buenos noches, mein Fuhrer!"

Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you can't actually call these places! Don't you know how expensive international calls are?"
Bart Simpson,"Hello, operator? I'd like to make a collect call to..."
Bart Simpson,Australia.
Operator,This is the international operator. Will you accept a collect call from...
Bart Simpson,"Er, uh, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of the International Drainage Commission. It's an emergency."
Little Boy,"If it's an emergency, then."
Bart Simpson,"We understand some drains in your area have been malfunctioning, sucking in people and what-not."
Little Boy,Whillikers! That's orful!
Bart Simpson,"Indeed. We need you to check your sinks and toilets and tell us which way the water is going. And, please -- stand clear!"
Little Boy,"The fixtures, they're all draining clockways, sir."
,
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart! The bakery caught fire and all of downtown smells like cookies! Wanna go smell?"
Bart Simpson,Yes. Yes I do.
Little Boy,Hullo? Sir? Sir?
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Little Boy,"I've returned from the Koolamuggery's place. They're draining clockways, too."
Bart Simpson,"Draining? Oh, I don't care about that anymore."
Little Boy,Are we in any dange--
Homer Simpson,Burkina Faso? Disputed Zone? Who called all these weird places?
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm gonna ask Marge."
Homer Simpson,
,
Father,Nine hundred dollaridoos?! Tobias! Did you accept a six hour collect call from the States?
Little Boy,It was an emergency call from the International Drainage Commission in Springfield.
Father,"Oh my God, there's nothing wrong with the bidet, is there?"
Bart Simpson,Y'ello?
Father,"Right, I'm calling all the way from Squatter's Crag, Australia, and I want to speak to a Dr. Bart Simpson right now!"
Bart Simpson,Uhh... Hold please.
Father,"All right, but I don't--"
Father,"Oy! I said ""Bart Simpson!"" What kind of a company is th--"
Bart Simpson,Bart Simpson's office.
Father,"Well thank the great good lord. Look, I was just--"
Bart Simpson,"One moment, please."
Father,"Who do they think I am? Some stupid Aussie drongo? Bleedin' Yanks, I oughta --"
Bart Simpson,"This is Bart Simpson. Can I help you, Ma'am?"
Father,"Hey! My name is Bruno Drundridge, right? You owe me nine hundred dollars, mate!"
Bart Simpson,No. You owe me nine hundred dollars.
Father,"You're just some punk kid, aren't you? Ooh, you picked the wrong guy to tangle with here, mate!"
Bart Simpson,"I don't think so. You're all the way in Australia. Hey, I think I hear a dingo eatin' your baby."
Father,"Yeah, well... That's it. I'm gonna report this to me Member of Parliament!"
Father,"Hey, Gus! I got somethin' to report to you!"
,
Gus,"That's a bloody outrage, it is! I'm gonna take this all the way to the Prime Minister!"
Gus,"Hey, Mr. Prime Minister! Andy!"
Prime Minister,"Ay, mates! What's the good word?"
,
Bart Simpson,Mr. Simpson... blah blah... misrepresentation over telephone... yadda yadda... Sincerely... Some Australian jerk.
Lisa Simpson,Hey! I need that!
Lisa Simpson,"Office of the Solicitor General? ""Office of the Prime Minister?"" ""Hopping Mad Collection Agency?"" What is all this stuff?"
Bart Simpson,Nothing. Some stupid country thinks I owe them money.
Lisa Simpson,"Uh-oh. Bart, you better talk to Mom and Dad about this."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... I'm being indicted for fraud in Australia."
Homer Simpson,"Psh, that's no reason to block the TV."
Marge Simpson,Oh my.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, did you trick an Australian boy into accepting a nine hundred dollar collect call?"
Bart Simpson,Yes'm.
Homer Simpson,"There it is. ""Aust-rali-a."" I'll be damned..."
All Legislators,
Homer Simpson,"Look at this country: ""U - r - gay."""
Evan Conover,"Oh, my. Hello, I'm Evan Conover, with the U.S. State Department."
Marge Simpson,Undersecretary for International Protocol. Brat and Punk Division.
Evan Conover,"Unfortunately, Bart, your little ""escapade"" could not have come at a worse time. Americo-Australianian relations are at an all-time low."
Evan Conover,"As I'm sure you remember, in the late 1980's, the U.S. experienced a short-lived infatuation with Australian culture."
Evan Conover,"For some bizarre reason, the Aussies thought this would be a permanent thing. Of course, it wasn't."
Lisa Simpson,"I know those words, but that sign makes no sense."
Evan Conover,"Anyway, the ""down under"" fad fizzled, and the diplomatic climate turned absolutely frosty."
Evan Conover,Oops. Let's pretend we didn't see that.
Evan Conover,And Bart's childish taunting agitated the Aussies further.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. What can we do for you?"
Evan Conover,"Well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign of good faith to our Australian friends, we'd like to imprison Bart for five years."
Homer Simpson,"That's tough but fair. Boy, go with the man."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, no, no! I'm not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with Australia! You'll just have to find some other country to have relations with."
Evan Conover,"You're sure now, the prison train is sailing... Okay, I'm not hearing a lot of support for prison. There is one other option. They'll drop the charges if... Bart makes a public apology in Australia."
Homer Simpson,"All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?"
Bart Simpson,I can handle that. I'm an expert at phony apologies.
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,I'm sorry.
Marge Simpson,That's better.
Bart Simpson,

Homer Simpson,We left at 1:30 P.M. Monday. What time is it now?
Opponent #2,Check mate.
Lisa Simpson,"It's 6:45 A.M. next Wednesday. You may also be interested to know that it's summer here, not winter."
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,What does that sign say? I thought they spoke English in this country!
Lisa Simpson,It says you can't bring in outside plants or animals. Any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance.
Bart Simpson,Oh.
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, girl. I don't wanna get in any more trouble down here."
Bart Simpson,I'll pick you up on the way home.

Homer Simpson,"Hey, are you like one of those English guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?"
Sentry,"No, sir. U.S. Marine Corps, sir."

Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, this is the life. Boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in Orlando, Florida?"
Bart Simpson,"I'm way ahead of ya, Dad."
Evan Conover,"Kno-ock! Simpsons, I'd like you to meet our ambassador, the Honorable Averell Ward."
Ambassador,"Hello. Now, everything is all set for Bart's apology. Mr. Conover will meet you at the Parliament House at three P.M. Any questions?"
Bart Simpson,Yeah. Do the toilets go backwards in here?
Ambassador,"No. To combat homesickness, we've installed a device that makes them swirl the correct, American way."
Homer Simpson,SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY... OF THEE I SING.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, G.I. Joe, your sign's broken. We're already in Australia."
Sentry,"Actually, sir, the embassy is considered American soil, sir."
Homer Simpson,"Really? Look, boy! Now I'm in Australia! Now I'm in America!"
Homer Simpson,Australia! America! Austr--
Bart Simpson,"I get it, Dad."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's enough."

Australian,You call that a knife. This is a knife.
Bart Simpson,That's not a knife. That's a spoon.
Australian,"All right, all right, you win. I see you've played knife-y spoony before."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about."
Bartender,"Something wrong, yank?"
Homer Simpson,"No. It's pretty big, I guess."
Marge Simpson,I'll just have a cup of coffee.
Bartender,Beer it is.
Marge Simpson,No. I said coffee.
Bartender,Beer?
Marge Simpson,Coff - ee!

Marge Simpson,C... O...
Bartender,B... E...

Marge Simpson,We'll meet you boys back here for dinner. Good luck honey.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I'm sorry I'm gonna miss your public humiliation, but the Woolumbaloo Dirt Monument is just too exciting to pass up."
Prime Minister,"Hear ye, hear ye. This session will now come to order. With the cooperation of the U.S. Department of State, we have present today one Bart Simpson."
All Legislators,
Prime Minister,I believe he has something to say. Bart?
Bart Simpson,I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did to your country.
All Legislators,
Prime Minister,"Well, you're free to go, Bart. Right after your additional punishment."
Homer Simpson,Punishment?!
Prime Minister,"Well, a mere apology would be a bit empty, eh? Let the booting begin!"
Homer Simpson,Booting?
Prime Minister,"Oh, it's just a little kick in the bum."
Bart Simpson,Yuh-oh.
Homer Simpson,What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
Evan Conover,"Mr. Simpson, shhsh! Disparaging the boot is a bootable offense. It's one of their proudest traditions."
Homer Simpson,"You sold us out, Conover!"
Homer Simpson,Stay back or I'll boot your Prime Minister! I'll do it! So help me God I'll boot him!
Homer Simpson,"When will you Australians learn? In America, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. The streets are safe. Old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. And the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. So, like us, let your children run wild and free. Because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. Now boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil!"
Guard,I'll stop them!
Australian,"Oh, no! It's coming back this way!"
Guard #2,That throwing stick stunt of yours has boomeranged on us.
,
Bart Simpson,Hey! We can get away in their pouches!
Bart Simpson,Ewww. It's not like in cartoons.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, there's a lot more mucus!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, you said I could have one souvenir, right? Well I want a didgeridoo."
Marge Simpson,That seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir. Why don't you get this nice cap?
Marge Simpson,"It's clever, just like you. Huh? Huh?"
Shopkeeper,Get out. Get out. Shoo! Shoo! Get outta here!
Bullfrogs,
Shopkeeper,"These bloody things're everywhere! They're in the lift, in the lorry, in the bonwizzit, and all over the malongagoolachuck..."
Teenage Clerk,"They're like kangaroos, but they're reptiles, they is."
Marge Simpson,We have them in America. They're called bullfrogs.
Teenage Clerk,"What? At's an odd name. I'da called them ""chuzz-wuzzers."""
Bart Simpson,Liiiiisa!
Homer Simpson,Maaarge!
,
,
Ambassador,"Ugh, the Simpsons. Well, they're not getting back in here."
,
Marge Simpson,"I can't believe our government would set up Bart like that. I must say, I'm very angry at the State Department right now."
Selma Bouvier,"When are you going to wake up and smell your husband, Marge?"
Ambassador,"Yes, but ssh! Mrs. Simpson, please. We're about to reach a breakthrough with the Aussies."
Evan Conover,"Then it's agreed. During the bargaining session, we each get two candied apples. All right... one candy and one caramel."
,
Marge Simpson,"Our countries may have their differences, but as human beings I think we can all agree there's no substitute for the discipline of a loving parent."
Marge Simpson,He wants to talk to you.
Evan Conover,Y'ello? Mmm hmm. So we're in agreement. She won't be allowed near the phone again.
Marge Simpson,
,
Ambassador,We did it! We've worked out a compromise that will allow both nations to save face.
Evan Conover,We've argued them down to... a booting.
Lisa Simpson,What?!
Ambassador,The Prime Minister just wants to kick you once. Through the gate. With a regular shoe.
Evan Conover,I believe it's a wing-tip.
Marge Simpson,"No deal! This is my son we're talking about. Sure he's not perfect, but who is in this work-a-day world?"
Bart Simpson,"No, Mom... Wait. It's time for me to bend over and receive my destiny."
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Bart. I promise I won't make fun of you later for this."
Homer Simpson,"Show 'em what American butts are made of, son!"
Prime Minister,"That's it, lad. This is for the Commonwealth of Australia."
Bart Simpson,And this is for the United States of America.
Bart Simpson,
Australians,
Marge Simpson,"I'm glad you're okay honey, but I wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic."
Lisa Simpson,I'm impressed that you were able to write so legibly on your own butt.
Prime Minister,"All right, mates! Let 'em have it!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?"
Bart Simpson,"So, uh, what's your hurry to get to school?"
,
Pilot,"No, sir. The closest vessel is the U.S.S. Walter Mondale. It's a laundry ship. They'll take you the rest of the way."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, look. Those frogs are eating all their crops."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species into an ecosystem that can't handle them."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, this place is gonna smell classy all week."
Barney Gumble,To Homer-- the Wall Street genius!
Lenny Leonard,"Hey Homer, how come you got money to burn, or singe anyway?"
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, Homer. What's your secret investment?"
Homer Simpson,Take a guess.
Barney Gumble,"Uh, pumpkins?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's right Barney. This year I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October, and I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang, that's when I'll cash in."
Barney Gumble,To Homer! And to Sergeant Pepper who is growing out of the middle of your back.
Moe Szyslak,"Ah Barn, you gotta unwrap the plastic before you smoke these."
,
Broker,"Homer, you knucklebeak, I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell your pumpkin futures before Halloween. Before!"
Homer Simpson,"All right, let's not panic. I'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. I can get by with one."
,
Homer Simpson,How am I going to tell Marge we're broke? I need a miracle.
Homer Simpson,My house is on fire! Woo hoo! Insurance to the rescue.
Selma Bouvier,"Hello, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we had a deal. Your sisters don't come here after six, and I stop eating your lipstick."
Marge Simpson,This is a special occasion. Patty and Selma just got promoted at the DMV.
Selma Bouvier,"Yeah, Homer, let your wife have a glimpse of success, for once."
Homer Simpson,"All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
Selma Bouvier,
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry. Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man."
Homer Simpson,Wrong!
Patty Bouvier,"Granted, you got some kids out of him. But when the seeds have been planted, you throw away the envelope."
Marge Simpson,"I wish you wouldn't put Homer down like that. He may not be a big success like you, but I can always count on him to provide for the family."
Homer Simpson,"Sweet, trusting Marge. I can't let you down. I'll get some money somehow."
,
Homer Simpson,If only I could think of an invention. Something that would really make money. Must concentrate and work harder than I've ever worked...
,
Executive,"Congratulations, Mr. Simpson. This invention of yours has made us all rich. Especially you. It's simple, yet ingenious and it fits right in the palm of your hand!"
Executive,"Every person in America now owns one of these, and in many cases three or four."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, could I just get a look at that?"
Executive,Why would you need to see it? You're the genius who invented... the product in question.
Homer Simpson,"But uh, could I just..."
Executive,Now don't worry. You'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.
Homer Simpson,Let me see! Let me see! Out of the way!
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, wake up. There's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime."
Homer Simpson,"No, my invention! All my money problems could've..."
Marge Simpson,"Money problems? Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, my loyal wife, of course not."
Homer Simpson,"And Lisa, my little princess."
Homer Simpson,And who could forget dear Rat boy?
Bart Simpson,Rat boy? I resent that.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, I told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall."
,
Bart Simpson,"What a day, eh Milhouse? The sun is out, birds are singing, bees are trying to have sex with them - as is my understanding..."
Milhouse Van Houten,It is a gorgeously fabulous day. Marvelous even.
Milhouse Van Houten,Nothin'. What's your hurry?
Milhouse Van Houten,"That's enough, Bart. Fun is fun but if we're late we're gonna get in trouble."
Bart Simpson,"You're right, Milhouse. Fun is fun."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Attention students. It's time once again to choose a gym class for the coming term. So let's all prove how adult we can be by filing to the gym in a calm and orderly manner. Even though it's first-come first-serve, and the most popular sports fill up fast."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Arrg, too many wee ones."
,
Richard,This gets uglier every year. Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?
Lewis Clark,"No. And if they don't get here soon, it'll be T.S. for them..."
,
Ralph Wiggum,I don't feel right.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Did you hear that, Bart? That was the tardy bell. ""Truant! Truant! Truant!"" they'll all say!"
Bart Simpson,"Aw, who needs him. I can have fun all by myself."
Bart Simpson,S'allright?
Bart's Fist,S'allright.
Bart Simpson,S'allright?
Bart's Fist,S'allright.
Bart Simpson,S'allright?
Bart's Fist,S'allright.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However since you have no collateral, I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance."
Homer Simpson,"Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn't you just bash my head in?"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey! Are you a loan shark? Do you understand how finance works? Now let's do this thing."
,
Bart Simpson,Oh no. It's P.E. sign up day!
Lisa Simpson,How could you forget? They had signs posted all over the library.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Better sign up for somethin' fast, man. Baseball just filled up--"
Nelson Muntz,So did Tae Kwon Do.
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Rye am Romer Rimpson...
Seymour Skinner,"There is only one class left, but it happens to be the ""coolest"" one of all."
Bart Simpson,Ballet? Dancin' is for girls!
Seymour Skinner,Well you should have gotten here earlier.
,
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I need an another extension on my mortgage payments."
Lender,"I understand that, Mr. Simpson. But according to our computer, your credit history is not good. It says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. It also says that you once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like a vacuum cleaner."
Homer Simpson,That was in the third grade.
Lender,"Yeah, well it all goes on your permanent record. I'm sorry, but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow-- the bank is going to take your house."
Homer Simpson,"Well, good luck finding it because I'm gonna take the numbers off tonight."
Lender,Well we'll look for the house with no numbers.
Homer Simpson,Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
Lender,Well then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.
Homer Simpson,"All right, you'll get your money."
,
Homer Simpson,"You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money."
Selma Bouvier,We'll take care of you.
Patty Bouvier,Yes. Care.
Patty Bouvier,Cut him a check and get him the hell out of here.
,
Homer Simpson,What a wonderful dinner. What a beautiful family. Someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.
Lisa Simpson,"You're certainly in a good mood tonight, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Well, Lisa, I managed to solve a little problem today. And to celebrate, I'm going to tilt my chair."
Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, slanty."
Marge Simpson,"Patty, Selma. What are you doing here?"
Patty Bouvier,"Oh, we thought we'd stop by unexpectedly for dinner."
,
Selma Bouvier,"Now bring us some extra chairs, like a good blubber-in-law!"
Homer Simpson,Time to fertilize the lawn. A couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. Their necks are brittle."
Patty Bouvier,"That's okay, Marge, nothing's broke."
Patty Bouvier,Except Homer.
Marge Simpson,What's that supposed to mean?
Patty Bouvier,It means...
Homer Simpson,It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
Selma Bouvier,Now there's a stink I coulda done without.
,
Marge Simpson,"This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. I'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, Montreal Morn."
Homer Simpson,"All right, you had your fun. Now get lost."
Patty Bouvier,"Oh, our fun hasn't begun yet."
Homer Simpson,Hunh?
Selma Bouvier,We know something you don't want Marge to know. Now we own you like Siegfried owns Roy.
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry. All we have is Nescafe. I'm very, very sorry."
Patty Bouvier,"Oh Marge, Marge. You're just in time. Homer's getting ready to give us a foot rub."
Marge Simpson,You are?
Homer Simpson,No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.
Patty Bouvier,You can start with the corns.
Selma Bouvier,Then you can move on to bunion country.
,
Bart Simpson,"Okay, steady Bart. Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man."
Ballet Teacher,"All right, girls. Today we learn the dance of the fairy queens. You can either be a fairy or a queen, it's wide open."
Bart Simpson,
Ballet Teacher,"Ah, and what have we here? A young man, maybe, who thinks he can be the next Baryshnikov?"
Bart Simpson,I don't want to be the next anything. I'm only taking this stupid class because they made me.
Patty Bouvier,"Well good. Jump, Homer, jump."
Opponent #3,Check mate.
Ballet Teacher,"So, he has fire in the belly. But it will take more than belly-fire to be the next Baryshnikov!"
Bart Simpson,"Look, Boris. I think ballet's for sissies."
Ballet Teacher,"Ballet is for the strong, the fierce, the determined. But for the sissies? Never. Now put on this fuchsiatard. You are a fairy."
,
Lenny Leonard,Quittin' time!
Carl Carlson,"Let's go, Homer. On the way home, we're all stopping at Moe's for a Zima."
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe I'll just stay and work overtime. My sisters-in-law are at my house again."
Carl Carlson,"Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity. Pull yourself together and come get drunk with us."
,
Ballet Teacher,"Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?"
Bart Simpson,"I don't like wearing tights, ma'am."
Ballet Teacher,"But so many of your heroes wear tights. Batman, for example. And Magellan."
Bart Simpson,"Look, I don't like this cootie platoon and I never will. I'm outta here and I'm out of this stupid outfit."
Bart Simpson,"Wait! Joy of movement increasing... Love of dance, impossible to resist... Toes twinkling... Look at me, girls. I'm doing ballet...and I love it!"
,
Patty Bouvier,"Am I wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?"
Homer Simpson,Request permission to slink by.
Patty Bouvier,"Permission pending. First, light our cigarettes."
Homer Simpson,But you're already smoking cig...
Homer Simpson,You're really pushing it.
Selma Bouvier,"C'mon, Homer. You can't spell obsequious without ""IOU."""
Homer Simpson,I'll have to trust you on that.
Patty Bouvier,"Well, Marge was always a good speller. Let's ask her."
Homer Simpson,No! Don't tell Marge! I'll be good. I'll be good!
Patty Bouvier,Ah-ah-ah-ah! Just for that you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.
Homer Simpson,"But... Yes, ma'am."
Patty Bouvier,"Now say ""I am Homer Simpson, the lowly dog."" In a dog voice."
Marge Simpson,What's going on in here?
Homer Simpson,"Rabsolutely rothing, Rarge."
Marge Simpson,What's that paper?
Homer Simpson,What paper?
Marge Simpson,"Homer, is this projection accurate? Did you borrow money from my sisters?"
Homer Simpson,"I don't know Marge, I can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings."
Selma Bouvier,He blew all your savings on jack-o-lanterns.
Homer Simpson,You told!
,
Homer Simpson,Sorry Marge.
Homer Simpson,I never want to see you again! You either!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Homer why didn't you tell me?"
Homer Simpson,"I was ashamed, Marge. I failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, I was a B-plus dog. I'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight."
,
Lisa Simpson,"How's Dad, today?"
Marge Simpson,"Not too good, Lisa. Frankly, he's underneath the table."
Homer Simpson,Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
Marge Simpson,But I like to make you breakfast.
Homer Simpson,"In that case, I'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it. Maybe a little powdered sugar."
,
Bart Simpson,"See that? I started to do like a little arabesque, but then I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechant. Not that I'm into that kind of thing."
Ballet Teacher,"Bravissimo, Bart. Next week, class gives its first recital. And you... you will dance the male lead."
Bart Simpson,Dance in front of my whole school? What is it with you and ballet?
Ballet Teacher,"I know you have great conflict, Bart. You love ballet, yet you fear the boys will laugh at you. No?"
Bart Simpson,"No, I fear the girls will laugh at me. I fear the boys will beat the living snot out of me."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey Dad, whatcha doing?"
Homer Simpson,What was that -- national anthem?
Homer Simpson,Daddy has very important work to do. He's looking through the Want Ads to find a part-time job.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no wonder I didn't hear about Bart being elected world's greatest sex machine."
Homer Simpson,I'll never pay off that debt.
Narrator,Need money fast? Got no experience? Step up to elegance. Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
Homer Simpson,"That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,I didn't turn it on. I thought you turned it on.
Homer Simpson,"No. Well anyway, turn it off."
Lisa Simpson,It is off.
,
,
Seymour Skinner,You're gonna have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here as part of detention.
Bart Simpson,Pretty big crowd.
Seymour Skinner,Mm hm. We even bussed in troublemakers from other schools.
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,That spikey-haired masked dancer is really something. I wonder who he is.
Jimbo Jones,He's graceful yet masculine. So it's okay for me to enjoy this.
Nelson Muntz,"This reminds me of the movie ""Fame"" and to a lesser extent the TV series, which was also called ""Fame."""
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh wow! I can't believe my very first passenger is comedy legend, Mel Brooks! I love that movie, ""Young Frankenstein"". ...Scared the Hell out of me."
Mel Brooks,"Uhm, thanks."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. I'll be that Carl Reiner guy, you be what's his face."
Mel Brooks,"Homer, it's not that easy. It takes the genius of Carl Reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and I..."
Homer Simpson,"Sir, today every country has a national anthem. Did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?"
Mel Brooks,"Sure, sure we had. Of course, we was caves, but every cave had a national anthem. I'll never forget my cave's national anthem."
Bart Simpson,Dang.
Mel Brooks,"LET 'EM ALL GO TO HELL, EXCEPT CAVE SEVENTY-SIX..."
Mel Brooks,What's with the si... what's with the siren?
Chief Wiggum,Evening Simpson... You got a short in your taillight. It started blinkin' when you made that turn. Let's see your chauffeur's license.
Homer Simpson,"Chauffeur's license, eh? Mel, buckle your borscht belt!"
Chief Wiggum,"Ah, since you're trying to make a getaway in park, I'm guessing you don't have a license. Better head down to the DMV. These two broads'll help you out."
Mel Brooks,"Well. Officer, uh, this man is making me a little edgy. Could you please give me a ride to the airport?"
Chief Wiggum,"Well, hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks! Sure I'll give you a ride."
Mel Brooks,Thank you.
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, on the way, we can do that two thousand dollar man thing."
Mel Brooks,
Chief Wiggum,"You be Carl Reiner and I'll be uh, Police Chief Wiggum."
Mel Brooks,Listen. Why don't you play Carl Reiner and let me play Police Chief Wiggum? I hate Carl Reiner!
,
Jimbo Jones,"I haven't been moved like this since ""The Joy Luck Club."""
Bart Simpson,"Behold, the masked dancer is me, Bart."
Bart Simpson,It is I who have won your acclaim!
Jimbo Jones,Bart does ballet!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,He dances like girls!
Nelson Muntz,Haw-haw!
Bart Simpson,"Go ahead and laugh. But I took a chance and did something I wanted to do. And if that makes me a sissy, well then, I guess I'm a sissy."
Jimbo Jones,He's a sissy! Let's rush him!
,
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
Ballet Teacher,Bart use the ballet! Leap! Leap like you've never leapt before.
Bart Simpson,
Jimbo Jones,Looks like he took a pretty bad spill.
Nelson Muntz,"Well, as long as he's hurt."
Seymour Skinner,I'm telling you people the earth revolves around the sun.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I am so proud of you. You showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. From this day forward we are kindred spirits."
Bart Simpson,Why did she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention?
,
Homer Simpson,"Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV where stupid Patty and stupid Selma work. Sometimes I think God is teasing me, just like he teased Moses in the desert."
Marge Simpson,"""Tested,"" Homer, God tested Moses. And try to be nice to my sisters. It's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm."
,
Patty Bouvier,"Well, well, well. Look who needs us again to get his chauffeur's license."
Homer Simpson,"Look, all I ask is that you be fair."
Patty Bouvier,"Did not adjust side mirror, minus one point."
Selma Bouvier,"Failed to check blind spot, minus two points."
Homer Simpson,"You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?"
Patty Bouvier,"You are a loser, Homer. And we're winners. You gotta learn that."
Selma Bouvier,"Ooh, seat belt twisted, minus one point."
Homer Simpson,"Nagging the driver, minus ten points for you."
Patty Bouvier,"Grazed a cone, minus five points."
Homer Simpson,"Being a jerk, minus a million points."
,
Patty Bouvier,One more wrong answer and Homer flunks another of life's little tests. And what's this?
Selma Bouvier,"Ohhh, someone didn't fill in a circle all the way."
Homer Simpson,
Patty Bouvier,"Ohhh, oh boy. Oh that felt good."
Selma Bouvier,"Let me try. Let me try. Oh yeah, oh boy. Oh that was so sweet."
Marge Simpson,"So Homer, how'd you do?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, I..."
Kent Brockman,That's according to a national survey ranking Springfield as the least popular city in America.
Grampa Simpson,Burn him!
Supervisor,Ladies. Please don't tell me you're smoking in a government building. Because that is precisely the kind of infraction that can cost a couple of sisters their promotion.
Selma Bouvier,"Well uh, we...."
Selma Bouvier,uh... she uh...
Homer Simpson,I'll never forgive myself for this.
Supervisor,"Wait a minute, those are yours, sir?"
Homer Simpson,Yes. I am in flavor country.
Supervisor,Both of them?
Homer Simpson,It's a big country.
Supervisor,"Ladies, I apologize. And you, sir, are worse than Hitler."
Patty Bouvier,"Homer, I'm -- I'm speechless. You just saved our hides."
Homer Simpson,"Please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides."
Marge Simpson,That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
Homer Simpson,"I didn't do it for them. I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you. Please ask me to kill for you."
Marge Simpson,"No, Homie. You see. You see, this is the stuff I've been telling you about that you never see."
Patty Bouvier,"Homer, we're... sorry."
Selma Bouvier,If there's anything we can do to make it up...
Homer Simpson,Call off the debt?
Patty Bouvier,"Or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test."
Homer Simpson,Call off the debt?
Selma Bouvier,Uh... well...
Homer Simpson,"Debt's off! Let's go, Marge. Woo hoo!"
Kent Brockman,Hello. I'm Kent Brockman and this is Eye on Springfield.
Kent Brockman,Tonight we'll visit Springfield's answer to the Benedictine Monks. The rappin' Rabbis.
Head Rabbi,DON'T EAT PORK. NOT EVEN WITH A FORK.
Back-up Rabbis,CAN'T TOUCH THIS!
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, are we Jewish?"
Marge Simpson,"No, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,Mmmmm.
Kent Brockman,But first: we all stink.
Man In Background,Hey!
Kent Brockman,In culture: dead last.
,
Krusty the Clown,"Eleanor, we've got to do something about this depression..."
Krusty the Clown,"So I propose... Oh, that's right, I'm crippled."
,
Lisa Simpson,This is horrible. People will start to avoid Springfield.
Homer Simpson,But what can I do? I'm just... one man.
Marge Simpson,"I think we should call a town meeting. If we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists at all."
Bart Simpson,No tourists? I'll be ruined.
Bart Simpson,Maps to movie stars homes! Mapa por las casas de las cineastas! Top-u stah noh cheezu map-u!
,
Japanese Man,Excuse me. Are you Drew Barrymore?
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, get outta here. I'm hung over!"
Japanese Woman,"Sorry, Miss Barrymore."
Moe Szyslak,What?
,
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,Are there any suggestions for how to attract more tourism?
Patty Bouvier,"The easiest way to be popular, is to leech off the popularity of others."
Selma Bouvier,So we propose changing our name from Springfield to Seinfeld.
Bart Simpson,"I may be just a boy, but I have an idea. If I may, I'd like to show you a few slides."
Bart Simpson,Here's Springfield as it appears from space. Somewhere in this windy valley is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Young man, that appears to be a picture of your rear end."
Bart Simpson,"So long, suckers!"
Bart Simpson,This is the last time I use a plan devised by Milhouse.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sorry, Bart."
Marge Simpson,"I'm Marge Simpson, and I have an idea."
Person,Marge is gonna say something.
Marge Simpson,Now I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. Like switching to the metric system...
Grampa Simpson,The metric system is the tool of the devil. My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead and that's the way I likes it.
Mayor Joe Quimby,The old person's remarks will be stricken from the record.
Grampa Simpson,Who said that?
Marge Simpson,But my new idea is different. I think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.
Chief Wiggum,Could we make our own movies and enter them?
Marge Simpson,Yes!
Chief Wiggum,At last -- an excuse to wear make-up!
Mayor Joe Quimby,All in favor of Marge Simpson's film festival idea?
Crowd,Film festival! Film festival!
Marge Simpson,"You like my idea? Actually, I have several others..."
Crowd,Don't push your luck! Don't push your luck!
Marge Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,And... action!
Bart Simpson,"Hello, I'm Bart Simpson. In the past, I've brought you such classic films as ""Homer in the Shower,"" and ""Homer on the Toilet."" And now, I give you... ""The Eternal Struggle."""
Homer Simpson,"Relaxed fit, my Aunt Fanny! Stupid Dockers! Oh, the belt is buckled."
,
Ned Flanders,"Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!"
Todd Flanders,Help meeeeee... eeeeeee... eeeee.
Ned Flanders,"Flanders to God, Flanders to God! Get off your cloud and save my Todd."
Maude Flanders,
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, God."
God,Okily dokily.
,
Lisa Simpson,Whatcha doin' Ma?
Marge Simpson,I'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival. Did you know there are over six hundred critics on TV and Leonard Maltin is the best looking of them all?
Lisa Simpson,Ewww.
,
,
Charles Bronson,I wish I was dead. Oy.
Jay,"But first we have a special guest: Rainer Wolfcastle, star of the reprehensible McBain movies."
Rainier Wolfcastle,"Jay, my new film is a mix of action and comedy. It's called ""McBain -- Let's Get Silly."""
Man In Audience,"You suck, McBain!"
Audience,"Hey, that really sucks."
Rainier Wolfcastle,The film is just me in front of a brick wall for an hour and a half. It cost Eighty million dollars.
Jay,How do you sleep at night?
Rainier Wolfcastle,"On top of a pile of money, with many beautiful ladies."
Jay,Just asking. Yeesh.
Lisa Simpson,"I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance..."
Homer Simpson,My ears are burning.
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, I wasn't talking about you, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip."
Marge Simpson,"""Dear Mr. Sherman. On behalf of the people of Springfield, I would like to invite you to judge our film festival."""
,
Marge Simpson,"""You can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."""
Homer Simpson,"Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?"
Marge Simpson,"Just a minute, Homer! Oh, look what you made me write! Anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."""
Jay,Hmm. Do I really want to leave Manhattan?
Rainier Wolfcastle,"Sherman, I just realized you've insulted me. Now you will die."
Jay,"Hey nudnick, your shoe's untied."
Rainier Wolfcastle,"From here they appear to be tied, but I will go in for a closer look."
Jay,Taxi!
Jay,To the airport!
Rainier Wolfcastle,"On closer inspection, these are loafers."
,
P.A. Announcer,"Attention, the flight from New York has arrived."
New York Pilot,"Hey, I'm landing here!"
,
Marge Simpson,"It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're right."
Homer Simpson,There ya... Just second...
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that should..."
Marge Simpson,"Hello, I'm Marge Simpson and this is my husband, Homer."
Jay,"Oh, nice to meet you, Marge. I saw your hair from the plane. And you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil."
Homer Simpson,It was a gummy bear.
,
TV Announcer,"Coming up next: ""The Flintstones Meet the Jetsons."""
Bart Simpson,Uh oh. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover.
Homer Simpson,"Bart Simpson, meet Jay Sherman, the Critic."
Jay,Hello.
Bart Simpson,"Hey man, I really love your show. I think all kids should watch it. I suddenly feel so dirty."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't know what's happening. It seems our profits have dropped thirty-seven percent.
Waylon Smithers,"I'm afraid we have a bad image, sir. Market research shows people see you as something of an ogre."
C. Montgomery Burns,I ought to club them and eat their bones!
Waylon Smithers,"Heh-heh. Well maybe this film festival could help us. A film biography might let them get to know the real you -- virtuous, heroic, nubile..."
C. Montgomery Burns,You left out pleasant!
C. Montgomery Burns,"But I like that film biography idea. A slick Hollywood picture to gloss over my evil rise to power, like ""Bugsy,"" or ""Working Girl."" Get me Steven Spielberg!"
Waylon Smithers,He's unavailable.
C. Montgomery Burns,Then get me his non-union Mexican equivalent.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Listen, SeÃ±or Spielbergo. I want you to do for me what Spielberg did for Oskar Schindler."
Spielbergo,Schindler es bueno. Senior Burns es el diablo!
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, the guest should get the last pork chop."
Homer Simpson,"But, I'm still hungry."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Sherman, I understand you have two Pulitzer prizes."
Jay,"Well, I, heh heh, it's not like I carry them around with me. Ooh, it's so hot in here."
Jay,"Oh, look, here's my Peoples' Choice Award..."
Jay,Five Golden Globes...
Jay,Hmmm... Where's my Emmy?
Santa's Little Helper,
Jay,Thank you!
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I won the belching contest at work."
Jay,Very nice Homer.
Lisa Simpson,Wow. How many Pulitzer Prizes winners can do that?
Jay,Just me and Eudora Welty.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I invited my sisters over."
Jay,"Oooh, sisters. Allow me."
Jay,
,
Jay,"So then, I said to Woody Allen: ""Well, Camus can do, but Sartre is smartre."""
Selma Bouvier,So original.
Marge Simpson,How droll.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well Scooby Doo can doo-doo... but Jimmy Carter is smarter!"
Patty Bouvier,"Okay, Sherman, you're a movie expert..."
Selma Bouvier,"So, tell us. Who's gay?"
Jay,"Oh, I don't know... Harvey Fierstein."
Selma Bouvier,No!
Patty Bouvier,Who else?
Jay,"Uh, uh..."
Jay,"Oh, McGyver's gay!"
Selma Bouvier,
Jay,
Homer Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"You bad-mouthed McGyver, didn't you?"
Jay,Muh... muh... muh...
Homer Simpson,"Whatcha doing, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,Making out the jury list for the film festival. Mayor Quimby -- Krusty -- Jay --
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do you respect my intelligence?"
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,Okay! Wait a minute. Why did it take you so long to say yes?
Marge Simpson,No reason.
Homer Simpson,Okay! Wait a minute. Are you humoring me?
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Okay! Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy. But does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song?"
Jay,"OH, I WISH I WERE AN OSCAR MAYER WEINER..."
Lisa Simpson,THAT IS WHAT I'D TRULY LIKE TO BE/ 'CAUSE IF I WERE AN OSCAR MEYER WEINER...
Jay,EVERYONE WOULD BE IN LOVE WITH MEEE!
Santa's Little Helper,
Homer Simpson,"That's it, Marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by."
Homer Simpson,"It's just you and me now, lock of hair..."
Marge Simpson,You don't have to do this.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well you think I'm stupid."
Marge Simpson,I don't think you're stupid.
Homer Simpson,Prove it.
Homer Simpson,Put me on that film jury festival thing.
Marge Simpson,Fine. You're on the jury.
Marge Simpson,
,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, the actors are here to audition for the part of you."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Actor #1,Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns,Next.
Actor #3,Ex... cell... ent.

,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Oh, I thought they were playing ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" tonight."
Jay,"Our first film is by Indian director Apu Nahassapemapetilan: ""Bright Lights, Beef Jerky."""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Help, help, police!"
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, I've got problems of my own right now."
Chief Wiggum,"Oh boy, this is gonna get worse before it gets better."
Homer Simpson,Pull my finger.
Jay,"Next, we have Moe the bartender in ""MO' BETTER BOOZE."""
Moe Szyslak,MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ DRINK IT DOWN/ YA STUPID CLOWN/ MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ THEN YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR ASS... WHOA!
Moe Szyslak,Augggh my back!
Hans Moleman,"Hans Moleman Productions presents ""Man Getting Hit By Football."""
Homer Simpson,This contest is over. Give that man the ten thousand dollars!
Jay,"This isn't ""America's Funniest Home Videos."""
Homer Simpson,But ... The ball... His groin!... It works on so many levels! Roll it again.
Barney Gumble,"Next, they're gonna show my movie."
Bart Simpson,You made a movie?
Barney Gumble,"I made a movie? No wonder I was on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly."""
Barney Gumble,"My name is Barney Gumbel. I'm forty, I'm single, and I drink."
,
Barney Gumble,"There's a line in ""Othello"" about a drinker -- ""now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast."" That pretty well covers it."
Woman,"It's brilliant. Savagely honest, tender -- he has the soul of a poet."
Barney Gumble,You're very kind.
Woman,Excuse me did something crawl down your throat and die?
Barney Gumble,It didn't die.
Barney Gumble,My name is Barney and I'm an alcoholic.
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Gumbel, this is a Girl Scout meeting."
Barney Gumble,Is it? Or is it that you girls can't admit you have a problem?
,
Barney Gumble,Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.
Marge Simpson,
Jay,I think we have a winner.
Homer Simpson,What'd I miss?
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please pay attention. There's just one more movie."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simple villagers, I promise you I will close plants in America and bring work here."
Bumblebee Man,Viva SeÃ±or Burns!
Villagers,Viva! Viva!
C. Montgomery Burns,Whoa-oa-oa!
C. Montgomery Burns,We did twenty takes and that was the best one.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Remember, Elliot, I'll be right here."
Audience,Pure egotism. / Self indulgent tripe.
C. Montgomery Burns,I don't care what they say. I'm going to win this festival.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Drink up, Judah Ben Hur."
BEN HUR,You truly are the King of Kings.
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, are they booing me?"
Waylon Smithers,"No, they're saying ""Boourns,"" ""Boourns."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Are you saying ""boo"" or ""Boourns?"""
Audience,Boo!
Hans Moleman,"I was saying ""Boourns."""
,
Marge Simpson,All right. It's time to vote for the grand prize.
Jay,"I vote for Barney Gumbel's sensitive, yet unfortunately titled film, Puke-ahontas."
Marge Simpson,Second.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Well, I vote for Burns' movie."
Krusty the Clown,"Me too. Now, let's get going. I got a date with Eudora Welty."
EUDORA WELTY,
Krusty the Clown,"Coming, Eudora."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent. Bribing those two judges has paid off. Just as it did during the Miss Teen America pageant.
,
Jay,How can you vote for Burns' movie?
Krusty the Clown,"Let's just say, it moved me. To a bigger house. Oops. I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet. Oh, oh dear."
Jay,"Two to two. Well, Homer, it all comes down to you."
Homer Simpson,Football in the groin. Football in the groin.
Jay,"Well, we're not gonna resolve this deadlock any time soon."
Marge Simpson,Why don't we all take a five minute break? It'll clear our heads.
Homer Simpson,"Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute."
,
Marge Simpson,I knew this would happen. I put you on the jury and you vote for the stupidest film.
Fortune Teller,I've been waiting for you... Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,How did you know my name?
Homer Simpson,I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
Jay,How many times have I heard Rex Reed say that?
Homer Simpson,"Oh great, now you're going to make fun of me."
Jay,"No, Homer, I won't make fun of you. But I will suggest that there may be better things in life than seeing a man get hit in the groin with a football."
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw.
Marge Simpson,"Well, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've got some serious thinking to do."
Homer Simpson,Hm. Barney's movie has heart. But football in the groin had a football in the groin.
Barney Gumble,Don't cry for me. I'm already dead.
Homer Simpson,Wow. I'll never drink another beer.
Vendor,Beer here!
Homer Simpson,I'll take ten.
,
Jay,"And now to announcer the winner. The award for outstanding animated short goes to Itchy and Scratchy for their film, ""Four Funerals and a Wedding."""
,
Jay,"And now, the winner of the grand prize:"
Jay,Barney Gumbel!
Barney Gumble,What?
Marge Simpson,"Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket."
Barney Gumble,"I've learned I have a gift to share with the world. From now on there'll be a new Barnard Gumbel -- hardworking, clean and sober."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Congratulations, Barney. And enjoy your grand prize: a lifetime supply of Duff Beer."
Barney Gumble,Just hook it to my veins!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Goodbye, Mr. Sherman. If I ever play Carnegie Hall, I'll give you a call."
Jay,And if you ever want to visit my show...
Bart Simpson,"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
Marge Simpson,"Well, Jay, I hope you tell your New York friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think."
FORTUNE-TELLER,Your name tag.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, look. This has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's Beer Nuts. Mmm... Beer Nuts."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Well, it was a lovely festival. The best movie won and Mr. Burns found there are some awards that can't be bought."
,
Rainier Wolfcastle,And the Oscar goes to...
C. Montgomery Burns,I've got to win this one. I've bribed everyone in Hollywood.
Rainier Wolfcastle,"George C. Scott in ""Man Getting Hit By Football."""
Actor,My groin.
,
Ned Flanders,"'Zounds, I did thee mightily smite-ly."
Ned Flanders,"""'Zounds"" is a renaissance English word, short for ""God's Wounds."" But uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure Flanders!"
Waylon Smithers,Please call a doctor.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, these Renaissance Faires are so boring."
Marge Simpson,Oh really? Did you see the loom? I took Loom in High School.
Bart Simpson,Meh.
Lunchlady Doris,Yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.
Homer Simpson,Can I have some?
Lunchlady Doris,Mine ears are open only to the pleas of those who speak ye old English.
Homer Simpson,"Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon."
Lunchlady Doris,Whatever.
Homer Simpson,I've eaten eight different meats. I'm a true Renaissance man.
Lisa Simpson,I'll go to the first aid tent and tell them to plug in ye olde stomach pump.
,
Chief Wiggum,Alight your gaze on yonder fabled beasts of yore.
,
Chief Wiggum,"Behold, the rarest of the rare, the mythological two-headed hound - born with only one head. Ooh - and here, out of the mists of history, the legendary esquilax - a horse with the head of a rabbit, and the body of a rabbit!"
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, it's ""galloping"" away!"
Lisa Simpson,Here bunny bunny! Here bunny!
Chief Wiggum,"Here, esquilax."
FORTUNE-TELLER,Would you like to know your future?
Lisa Simpson,"Sorry, I don't believe in fortune telling. I should go."
FORTUNE-TELLER,"What's your hurry? Bart, Maggie, and Marge are at the joust, and Homer is heckling the puppet show."
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, you can see into the... present."
Fortune Teller,Now we'll see what the future holds...
Lisa Simpson,The Death Card.
Fortune Teller,"No, that's good. It means transition, change."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, that's cute."
Fortune Teller,The Happy Squirrel.
Lisa Simpson,That's bad?
Fortune Teller,Possibly. The cards are vague and mysterious... They seem to be revealing the story of your first love. Do you want me to continue?
Lisa Simpson,Guess so.
FORTUNE-TELLER,"It's - it's coming to me. Yes, I see an Eastern university in the year two thousand ten. The world has become a very different place..."
Student In Jeans,I can't wait to see that play.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, watch it! / Watch it!"
Lisa Simpson,That man is instantly the most annoying person I've ever met. A soy-based snack will calm me down.
Lisa Simpson,Aaagh. Him again.
Lisa Simpson,"Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh, by Thompson."
Librarian,"The last copy was just signed out by ...Oh, Hugh Parkfield. Oh, there he is."
Lisa Simpson,No. It couldn't be...
Lisa Simpson,
HUGH,Thanks for holding my book while I tied my shoe.
Lisa Simpson,That's the book I need. You'll probably take forever with it too.
HUGH,I can read faster than you.
Lisa Simpson,I read at a 78th grade level.
HUGH,Right here.
Lisa Simpson,Finished this page?
HUGH,Ages ago.
Lisa Simpson,
HUGH,I'll get the dictionary.
Lisa Simpson,Why?
HUGH,"You'll see when you get there. The word ""stochastic."""
Lisa Simpson,Pertaining to a process involving a randomly determined sequence of observations.
Librarian,"First they hate each other. Now, all of a sudden, they love each other. Oh it doesn't make any sense to me."
Moustached Man,"Of course not, you're a robot."
HUGH,Hmm... I've never met anyone who so understood the magic of Jim Carrey.
Lisa Simpson,He can make you laugh with no more than a frantic flailing of his limbs.
,
,
HUGH,"I can't believe how much we have in common. We're both studying the environment, we're both utterly humorless about our vegetarianism, and we both love the Rolling Stones."
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, not for their music, but for their tireless efforts to preserve historic buildings."
HUGH,"Lisa, I can't bear the thought of being apart from you all summer. Come back with me to Parkfield Manor."
Lisa Simpson,I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?
HUGH,"Yes we can, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,That is good because eating animals is wrong.
HUGH,So very wrong.
Lisa Simpson,When will the world learn?
HUGH,I don't know. I just don't know.
,
Lisa Simpson,I love these new planes.
HUGH,"Yes, it's a good thing they reevaluated those wacky old designs."
,
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield."
Mrs. Parkfield,"Thank you, Lisa. They were made for the finest family in Britain."
Mr. Parkfield,I don't know how we ended up with them.
Mr. Parkfield,"Oh, it's good to hear a boisterous American laugh."
Lisa Simpson,"And I love that painting. Judging by the clothes, I'd say seventeenth century."
Mrs. Parkfield,"Actually, Lisa, it's just uncle Eldred."
Eldred,I get me brain medicines from the National 'Ealth.
,
Lisa Simpson,"This place is so enchanting, Hugh. I love it here."
HUGH,I wanted this to be perfect for you. I know you Americans like everything to be fireworks.
HUGH,Oh blast!
HUGH,"Go to ""Plan B."""
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, I will."
Stablehand,Isn't it wonderful? Master Hugh has found a true love.
,
Lisa Simpson,Hi Mom.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa!! Hello! How're you doing in England? Remember, an elevator is called a ""lift,"" a mile is called a ""kilometer,"" and botulism is called ""steak and kidney pie."""
Lisa Simpson,Guess what -- Hugh and I are getting married.
Marge Simpson,"ALL RIGHT!!! Lisa, that's wonderful. If only your father was still with us... but he left for work a few minutes ago."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, remember when I was little, we'd always plan my dream wedding and you always promised to, you know, well, keep Dad from ruining it?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, don't worry, honey. I guarantee your father will behave."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, it's a picture phone."
Marge Simpson,"This? This? No, I - I've just got a touch of the rheumatiz."
Lisa Simpson,Oh.
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, picture phone."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Mom. Aw, that's great news about Lisa. Well listen, I'd better get to get back to work."
Bart Simpson,"Heh, heh. They're finally paying me for this."
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah!
,
,
Carl Carlson,...except for the international market it's my...
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Oh, Marge, that's great news!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, hey there with the personal calls Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, ah, but Mr. Milhouse, my little girl's getting married!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Lisa? My one true love.
Lisa Simpson,"It's not you, Milhouse. I just don't plan to ever get married."
Milhouse Van Houten,"I think I'll write your performance evaluation now, Simpson."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I gotta call everyone and tell 'em the good news."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Will that girl ever shut up? Okay, Marge. I'll plan everything. We can have the reception at Moe's. Wait, why not have the whole wedding there? We'll do it on a Monday morning -- there'll be fewer drunks."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't take this personally, but I've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding."
Homer Simpson,"Well, these seem to be in order. I'll be out back in the hammock."
Waylon Smithers,Mr. Smithers plus guest. There's only one person I would want to bring.
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out the second they discover the cure for seventeen stab wounds in the back."
Waylon Smithers,"How're we doing, boys?"
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Well, we're up to fifteen!"
,
Troy McClure,"Now turn to the next problem. If you have three ""Pepsis"" and drink one, how much more refreshed are you? You, the redhead in the Chicago school system."
Girl,Pepsi?
Troy McClure,Partial credit.
Seymour Skinner,We've been invited to the wedding of our only graduate to read at an adult level.
Miss Hoover,"Hmm, it must be Lisa Simpson, because of course Martin Prince perished in that science fair explosion."
Martin Prince,"Not quite perished, my lady love. Although some days, I wish I had."
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, I remember you. Mayor Quimby, right?"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"I ah, er ah, uh no. Look at license. Mohamed Jafar."
Otto Mann,"Quimby, after this fare, get yer indicted ass out to the convention center."
Mayor Joe Quimby,I cut the ribbon at that convention center.
,
Lisa Simpson,Just a couple more blocks to my house.
HUGH,"Oh Lisa, please. The only thing bruised in that fall was my spine. I'll be delighted."
,
HUGH,"Lisa, darling, don't worry. I'm sure I'll get along with your family. You've so thoroughly prepared me for the worst, as long as they're not squatting in a ditch poking berries up their noses..."
Lisa Simpson,And if they are?
,
Bart Simpson,Here they come! Raise the flag!
Marge Simpson,Oh Lisa!
Homer Simpson,"Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?"
Lisa Simpson,Dad!
Marge Simpson,Now throw compost on it!
Homer Simpson,"Whew! Uh, enjoy."
HUGH,"Oh, still warm."
Homer Simpson,"You can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom I built. Remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh Hugh, thank you. You've been just wonderful through this entire ordeal."
HUGH,"Lisa, I love you so much I'm willing to go through anything."
Lisa Simpson,Are you okay?
HUGH,"I'm fine, Lisa. Fortunately, the compost heap broke my fall. Be a dear, run a bath."
,
Marge Simpson,Homer! Bart! Maggie! Company eating rules.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right."
Bart Simpson,"Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically I'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til I go to law school."
Homer Simpson,"So, Hugh. Have you heard all the latest American jokes? Uh, here's a good one. Pull my finger."
HUGH,"Yes, we have that one in England too, Mr. Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"I said, pull my finger."
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, Mom, we've got my wedding dress fitting this afternoon. Maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come with us?"
Marge Simpson,Maggie! Don't talk with your mouth full.
Homer Simpson,Me and Bart'll take Hugh out on the town this afternoon.
Lisa Simpson,Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
Homer Simpson,Great. There's only one thing I ask in return.
Homer Simpson,"So this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh Hugh?"
,
Kent Brockman,And tonight the following celebrities have been arrested:
Kent Brockman,"...while Heather Locklear Fortensky remains at large. Remember, if you see any celebrities, consider them dangerous."
HUGH,"You know, I rather like this pub."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, an English boy, eh? You know we saved your ass in World War Two."
HUGH,"Yeah, well, we saved your ass in World War Three."
Moe Szyslak,That's true.
Homer Simpson,"Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive."
HUGH,Well I'd be honored...
HUGH,...to wear... those... things.
Bart Simpson,Ow! Hey watch those virtual darts. I'm trying to play virtual pool!
Other Player,Ow!
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, no fightin' in my bar."
,
Marge Simpson,"You know, Fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, I didn't even notice."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again."
Homer Simpson,Keep it down in there!
,
Lisa Simpson,"All right, Dad! I'm sorry I left you alone with Homer and Bart."
HUGH,"No, no, honey. We had a fine time."
Lisa Simpson,How did you get that gash on your forehead?
HUGH,"Oh, that was when we hid in the dumpster after the fire alarm went off in the pornographic magazine warehouse."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, you are so good to put up with all of this."
HUGH,"Don't be silly, Lisa. Everything's fine. Really. Now, go to sleep. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow. A big, long day."
,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I can't believe it's your wedding day already."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I feel kinda funny wearing white - I mean, Milhouse."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Milhouse doesn't count."
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, I've got something old - that's my pearl necklace. Something new is the wedding dress. Something borrowed is this antique brooch from Hugh's mother. Now I just need something blue."
Marge Simpson,Here.
Lisa Simpson,Oh Mom. Thanks.
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me want to get married for a third time. I met a really nice exotic dancer the other night at Hugh's bachelor party."
Lisa Simpson,Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
Bart Simpson,We had one in his honor. I had one in his honor. I went to a strip club.
,
HUGH,"Well, here goes nothing. Mom, Dad, meet Homer Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya."
Homer Simpson,"You know what's great about you English? ""Octopussy."" Man, I must have seen that movie... twice."
HUGH,"Yes, yes. That's not too bad!"
Patty Bouvier,"Hey, Krabappel, you get in the way of that bouquet, I'll stuff that sun hat down your neck!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, take me home. I'm not fully defrosted."
Waylon Smithers,Nonsense. Just sit down and rest for a moment.
Waylon Smithers,There you go.
Waylon Smithers,Oh no. We've got a little situation here.
C. Montgomery Burns,I can't feel anything below my cummerbund.
,
Homer Simpson,Ooh la la.
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"You look great, sweetheart."
Lisa Simpson,Thanks.
Homer Simpson,"Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson. You know, I always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. Since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me."
Lisa Simpson,Oh Dad...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"And now, to sing ""Amazing Grace,"" Miss Maggie Simpson."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"She's quite a hellion, but she does have an incredible voice."
,
Homer Simpson,"No, no, let me finish. I just want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. You helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. But you're also my daughter, and I don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you're babbling."
Homer Simpson,See? You're still helping me.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Dad. Did you forget to give those cufflinks to Hugh?"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, no..."
Lisa Simpson,Well?
Homer Simpson,I found them on the night stand this morning. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.
Lisa Simpson,But you've been going on about these all week. I'm sure he just forgot.
,
HUGH,Lisa! We're not supposed to see each other before the wedding. It's tradition.
Lisa Simpson,What about my family's tradition?
HUGH,Surely you don't want me to wear those. In front of my parents and their friends?
Lisa Simpson,But you promised my Dad you would.
HUGH,"I was just humoring him, darling. Actually, he frightens me a bit."
Lisa Simpson,"I know they look a little silly, but his feelings will be hurt if you don't wear them."
HUGH,"Fine. I must say, you were right. This has been quite trying. You know I've attempted to enjoy your family on a personal level, on an ironic level, as a novelty, as camp, as kitsch, as a cautionary example, nothing works. Frankly, I'll be quite relieved when we get back to England and we won't have to deal with them."
Lisa Simpson,Are you saying we won't see my family again?
HUGH,"Well, possibly your mother will come when the children are born."
Lisa Simpson,I can't believe I'm hearing this. I don't want to cut my family out of my life.
HUGH,"Really? But Lisa, you're better than this place. You're like a flower that grew out of a pot of dirt."
Lisa Simpson,That's a horrible thing to say.
HUGH,"Oh come on, you complain about them more than anyone."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe. But I still love them. And I don't think you understand that.
,
HUGH,Stop everything. The wedding has been called off.
Adult Nelson,Haw haw.
NELSON JR.,Haw haw.
Aged Krusty,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Aw, this is very sad news... and it never would have happened if the wedding had been inside the church with God, instead of out here in the cheap showiness of nature."
Lunchlady Doris,Who wants cake?
Fortune Teller,"...the next day, Hugh goes back to England and you never see him again."
Lisa Simpson,"Wow. Now that I know all this, isn't there any way to change the future?"
Fortune Teller,No. But try to look surprised.
Lisa Simpson,I thought you said you'd tell me about my true love?
Fortune Teller,"Oh, you'll have a true love. But I specialize in foretelling the relationships where you get jerked around."
,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, Lisa! Where were you!? You missed the most incredible thing!"
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dad."
Homer Simpson,I ate seven pounds of fudge!
Lisa Simpson,Wow!
Homer Simpson,The man at the stand said it was a record!
Lisa Simpson,"Wow. What else did you do, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,I rode the teacups! Then I got a little sick and I had to sit down. But then I rode 'em again!
,
Kent Brockman,"Welcome to the six o'clock news in our brand new studio! Lookin' good, Springfield!!"
Kent Brockman,"In today's news, a two ton rhino escaped from the Springfield Zoo. But zoo officials were quick to act and Petunia, as she is known, is safely back in captivity."
Kent Brockman,"In other news, a three ton rhino that escaped from the zoo last week is still at large."
Marge Simpson,"All right, who broke my vase?!"
Lisa Simpson,Who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
Homer Simpson,Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?
Bart Simpson,"Oh, please! This is senseless destruction, with none of my usual social commentary."
Lisa Simpson,"If it wasn't you, then who was it?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?"
Homer Simpson,Did they?!
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'."
,
Bart Simpson,"I don't know why you're so energetic today, boy, but prepare to be worn out."
Lisa Simpson,"What's wrong, boy? Getting tired?"
,
Marge Simpson,I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little Helper. He was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
Lisa Simpson,My Bongo drums!
Bart Simpson,My strobe light!
Homer Simpson,"My ""Best of Ray Stevens featuring The Streak"" album! So it was the dog that buried all our stuff!"
Marge Simpson,"Yes, the dog..."
Homer Simpson,Oh my God! He's got the precious cable TV cable!
,
Kent Brockman,"Always use fresh macaroni. If the box rattles, throw it away..."
Chief Wiggum,
Cable Announcer,"Your cable TV is experiencing difficulties. Please do not panic. Resist the temptation to read or talk to loved ones. Do not attempt sexual relations, as years of TV radiation have left your genitals withered and useless."
Chief Wiggum,"Well, I'll be damned."
,
Marge Simpson,"Excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog..."
Pet Store Man,"Lady, I'll tell you what I'm telling everyone else. I'm sorry if your dog went blind, but your gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not with me."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, our dog is out of control. He's wild, destructive, and has little or no respect for authority."
Pet Store Man,Hmm... let me try a canine/human mind meld. It's an incredibly rare psychic power possessed only by me and three other clerks at this store.
,
,
Bart Simpson,Please?
Homer Simpson,"Well, problem solved."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, hold on to the wheel!"
Homer Simpson,You got it.
Bart Simpson,Hey!
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'."
,
Bart Simpson,"Look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him!"
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. As soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. Believe me, I know."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, this place is so big. Do you think we should split up and look for them, Homie? Homie?"
,
,
Homer Simpson,We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on.
Marge Simpson,"""She's The Fastest..."" Homer, I don't think that means necessarily..."
Track Announcer,And they're off! She's The Fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead!
Homer Simpson,"You're lucky you got looks, Marge."
Track Announcer,"As they round the far turn, it's She's The Fastest, followed by Always Comes In Second and I'm Number Three..."
Homer Simpson,"Yes! Come on, you little horse!"
Track Announcer,And they're in the home stretch. It's -- wait! Another dog is on the track!
Bart Simpson,It's Santa's Little Helper!
Track Announcer,"The mystery dog is gaining fast on the outside. Of course, he could never win this race - or could he?"
Lisa Simpson,What's Santa's Little Helper doing to that dog?
Marge Simpson,Uh-oh...
Bart Simpson,"It looks like he's trying to jump over her, but he can't quite make it. Come on, boy, you can do it!"
Track Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end. This is the end of dog racing."
Crowd,
Marge Simpson,I think they're in love.
Crowd,Aww...
Homer Simpson,"Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex."
Lisa Simpson,"Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?"
Marge Simpson,But she's not our dog.
Texan,She's yours now!
Texan,Once they fall in love they lose their racin' spirit.
Marge Simpson,But won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
Texan,"Lady, you're allll-right!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right?"
Marge Simpson,"Hey, what did I just say?!!"
Luigi,"Take it, it fell on the floor-a."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?"
Bart Simpson,"Me and Santa's Little Helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in!"
Marge Simpson,Bart! Don't ever say that word again!
Bart Simpson,Well that's what she is! I looked it up.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. It feels like a mistake to me."
Bart Simpson,Hey look! A really small dog just fell out of Santa's girlfriend.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my God! She's having babies! Oh, I'm sorry, girl. I thought you were just getting fat."
Lisa Simpson,"Look, it's twins!"
Homer Simpson,Now it's two sets of twins.
Bart Simpson,Two sets of twins and a triplet!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Homer find a place for all these little miracles."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my. I've never seen anything like this."
Lisa Simpson,How many more can there be?
Bart Simpson,"Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four..."
Bart Simpson,Twenty-five.
,
Lisa Simpson,Wow! Twenty-five puppies!
Bart Simpson,An army of dogs! No bully will ever touch me again!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, jerkface! You have the face of a jerk!"
Jimbo Jones,"All right, Simpson, you asked for..."
Bart Simpson,"Get 'em, boys!"
Bart Simpson,"Say, Jimbo ... hope I wasn't out of line with that ""jerkface"" crack."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?"
Homer Simpson,"Yes, we've waited many years, but the good Lord has finally blessed us with a real family."
,
Marge Simpson,"Look at Branford II! Isn't that cute? He thinks he's one of the Models, Inc."
Homer Simpson,Get that cat out of the way!
,
Bart Simpson,"Agh, my socks!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, why do I have to wear a flea collar?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's just easier this way."
,
Homer Simpson,Ooh... this time... Ah...
,
Marge Simpson,"Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?"
Homer Simpson,Do you have a better idea?
Marge Simpson,"Now I know we love the puppies very much, but I think they're getting to be a problem."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, they ate all my socks! I have to wear Lisa's to school today!"
Homer Simpson,"How do you explain the culottes, boy?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, I have to coordinate, don't I?"
Homer Simpson,Your mother and I have been thinking about giving the puppies away.
Lisa Simpson,Nooooooo!
Homer Simpson,Mainly your mother.
Lisa Simpson,"Is that what we do in this family? When someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?!"
,
Grampa Simpson,Hello? Is anybody there?
Marge Simpson,"All right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. As long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. On a completely unrelated topic, I'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight."
Homer Simpson,Splendid. Who's coming?
Marge Simpson,"Rev. Lovejoy, your old Army drill sergeant, and the Regional Director of the IRS."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, just lovely, Marge. The whole town will hear what a perfect evening this was, how nothing at all went wrong."
Chief Wiggum,"Don't worry folks, we'll find your wallet."
DRILL SGT.,"Simpson, this evening has gone so flawlessly, I'm gonna forget that you were mistakenly let out of the Army a month early."
Irs Agent,And I'm so impressed by this problem-free evening that there's no need for that audit.
Irs Agent,A toast to the Simpsons...
DRILL SGT.,And to the delectable turkey...that's walking around the table??!!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Dear Lord, it's a demon bird!"
Everyone,Ewwwww!
DRILL SGT.,"Simpson, see you at reveille O-five hundred tomorrow."
Irs Agent,See you at the IRS!

,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the Flanderosa."
Seymour Skinner,It'd be nice to have some companionship when mother goes out on dates.
Grampa Simpson,We could use a new pet over at the home seein' how we accidentally killed that smart-mouthed bird.
Lisa Simpson,They don't like being broken up.
Marge Simpson,"We've got to be realistic, kids. Who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"...and I know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets..."
Homer Simpson,Who wouldn't?
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, don't give the puppies to him! He'll be mean to them!"
Marge Simpson,"She's right, Homer. There's something about his face I don't trust."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm? Oh, of course not. They're your pets, you can do as you wish. Good day, everyone."
Marge Simpson,"My, he certainly took that well."
Homer Simpson,"A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies."
C. Montgomery Burns,There you go. There you go. You too...
Waylon Smithers,"Honestly, sir, you just don't put the effort into your schemes that you used to."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Going somewhere?
Marge Simpson,"Dogs! Chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor!"
Chief Wiggum,"No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm, uh, dusting for prints."
,
Bart Simpson,We don't have to wait for the cops - who can track the puppies better than their own mom and dad?
Lisa Simpson,Let's go find your babies!
Marge Simpson,"Dinner's on, dogs!"
Chief Wiggum,"I'm sorry, kids. I don't think we're ever gonna find your greyhounds. Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you one of the twenty-five he got last night."
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies?
,
,
,
Lisa Simpson,He's giving them a bath!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"There you are, there ya go li'l' fella, and you..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, look! He's standing up! I've never seen anything so adorable. You know who it reminds me of..."
Waylon Smithers,Benji?
C. Montgomery Burns,No.
Waylon Smithers,Lassie?
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, no. A person, you know who I mean."
Waylon Smithers,Snoop Doggy Dog? Bob Barker? David Brenner?
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no. The person who's always standing and walking."
Waylon Smithers,Rory Calhoun?
C. Montgomery Burns,That's it! You stay with me. You're the pick of the litter.
,
Lisa Simpson,Maybe we were wrong about Burns on this one.
,
Waylon Smithers,"Are you sure you want to go through with this, sir? You do have a very full wardrobe as it is."
C. Montgomery Burns,": Yes... But not completely full, for you see... / ""SOME MEN HUNT FOR SPORT, /OTHERS HUNT FOR FOOD / THE ONLY THING I'M HUNTING FOR / IS AN OUTFIT THAT LOOKS GOOD..."""
Edna Krabappel,Stee-rike!

C. Montgomery Burns,I really like the vest.
Waylon Smithers,"I gathered, yeah."
,
Lisa Simpson,He's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies!!!
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,Sorry. You've gotta admit it's catchy.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Come on, Smithers. Let's go finish the little flea circuses off. Except for ""Little Monty,"" of course."
Bart Simpson,We've gotta get the dogs outta there!
,
Lisa Simpson,Ssh.
Bart Simpson,"Hush, puppies!"
Lisa Simpson,We've gotta get you outta here!
Bart Simpson,"I know, the window!"
Lisa Simpson,No Bart! What're you doing?
Bart Simpson,Dogs always land on their feet.
Lisa Simpson,That's cats.
Bart Simpson,"No, it's dogs. I'll prove it."
Bart Simpson,Best two out of three.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, Look! A laundry chute!"
Bart Simpson,"Okay guys, let's move!"
Bart Simpson,Come on! Come on!
Lisa Simpson,I've got an idea!
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Monty, but you're too big for this ride."
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Quick, let's get..."
,
Bart Simpson,That's impossible! How did you get here first?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh well, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later. Right now, I'll be taking my puppies back."
Lisa Simpson,But they're ours! You stole them from us!
C. Montgomery Burns,Here's a phone. Call somebody who cares.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Give me that! Now if you'll excuse us, children, the pups have a date with a fashion knife."
Bart Simpson,"There! Now you don't know which one is Little Monty! I guess if you don't want him to be part of your tuxedo, you'll have to let the other dogs go, too!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nice try. C'mon, Little Monty, stand up!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Come on, stand up! Do your trick."
Lisa Simpson,"No, don't! Stay down, Monty! Don't get up! Stay down! Stay down, boy!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns,Now it's simply a matter of bending down and picking up the one and only...
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll have to kill them all.
Lisa Simpson,Nooo!!
C. Montgomery Burns,But they're so wretchedly adorable! Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns. I can't do it!
C. Montgomery Burns,But I can kill you!
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, I can't kill you either. Look at you standing there on your hind legs like a couple of Rory Calhouns."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly of killing innocent animals for fashion."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I have. I have! I swear I'll never wear any clothing made from an animal that can do an amusing trick!"
,
Track Announcer,"Another victory for Montgomery Burns' champion greyhounds! Twenty-five dogs, twenty-five world champions, which so far have earned their owner over ten million dollars. I'll bet whoever gave him those dogs is kicking themselves now!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer! For the love of God, no."
Edna Krabappel,You don't have the guts to take us all on.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds."
Homer Simpson,

Milhouse Van Houten,This bus has seen better days.
Bart Simpson,"Well, at least it's safer than the old bus."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh oh, time to move. The hole's gettin' bigger."
Edna Krabappel,"Seymour, the children are playing in the hole again. Shouldn't you get that fixed?"
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, you know they just cut the school's budget. Besides, if I had the money, I'd fix the exhaust leak in the back. Frankly, I think it's causing some of our low test scores."
,
Seymour Skinner,"All right, the battlefield is just a half mile ahead. Begin braking procedure!"
,
Tour Guide,"This civil war cannon has been fully restored and is in ready-to-fire condition. But it's a good thing we're not firing it, because it happens to be aimed at the main support leg of that lookout tower."
Tour Guide,People don't realize that these cannons are very sensitive and the slightest jolt could set them off.
Tour Guide,"Of course, for safety reasons, we don't keep the cannon loaded. It's just common sense."
Seymour Skinner,"Otto, why don't you get some more gas. Here's the 'credit card.'"
Seymour Skinner,...and a mint for afterwards.
,
Seymour Skinner,Five dollars a child?! Last year it was free.
Ticket Lady,Hmh. New ownership.
Seymour Skinner,"Bu..but we don't have that kind of money. In fact, no school could afford to..."
Shelbyville Principal,"Here's the admission, plus, uh something for you. See that they get a little extra education, would you?"
Ticket Lady,"Yes sir, Principal Valiant!"
Seymour Skinner,"He thinks he's so hot ever since he swept the ""princi"" awards. Those things are rigged."

Bart Simpson,
Narrator,"On May 21, 1864, the men of the Ninth Bearded Infantry were sunning and fluffing their beards in the sun. Suddenly, enemy troops crested that hill over there."
Enemy Soldier #1,"Fort Springfield, we surrender unconditionally!"
Enemy Soldier #2,"We're sick. We need leeches, and hack saws to saw off our gangrenous limbs!"
Narrator,But the Springfield brigade was too brave to accept the surrender...
Soldier #1,"Come on, boys! Those white flags are no match for our muskets!"
Soldier #2,Charge!
Narrator,... And the Springfielders heroically slaughtered their enemies as they prayed for mercy.
Bart Simpson,It's hard to see what's going on. I can only make out the fat soldiers.
Seymour Skinner,"All right children, switch."
Soldier #3,"Hey, they're trying to learn for free!"
Narrator,Get 'em!
Soldier #4,Use your phony guns as clubs!
Seymour Skinner,Run children!
Seymour Skinner,Start the bus Otto!! Start the bus!!
,
Otto Mann,Damn. I shouldn't have eaten the mint first.
Otto Mann,"Okay, hop on!"
Ãœter,Wait! Wait!
,
Edna Krabappel,"Well Seymour, because of your penny pinching, we're coming back from a field trip with the fewest children yet."
Seymour Skinner,God bless the man who invented permission slips.
,
Bart Simpson,"Ah, I think I got your lunch."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, yeah. I didn't think this was for me."
Edna Krabappel,"Seymour, the teachers are fed up. You have to start putting money back into the school. You've cut back on everything: salaries, supplies, the food. I don't care what you say, I can taste the newspaper."
Seymour Skinner,"Posh. Shredded newspapers add much needed roughage and essential inks. Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats."
,
Lunchlady Doris,There's very little meat in these gym mats.
Seymour Skinner,That's it!
Edna Krabappel,"Our demands are very reasonable. By ignoring them, you're selling out these children's futures."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, c'mon, Edna. We both know these children have no future."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I've never seen them fight like that, Bart. I'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike."
Bart Simpson,"Strike, eh?"
Bart Simpson,Oww! My bones are so brittle. But I always drink plenty of... malk?
,
Edna Krabappel,"How do you expect us to teach with these supplies? Well this pointer's so old, it's worn down to a nub."
Seymour Skinner,"It still points, doesn't it?"
Edna Krabappel,Stop that. And look at this. The only books we have are ones that were banned by other schools.
Seymour Skinner,"Well, the kids have to learn about Tek War sooner or later."
Edna Krabappel,"Go away, Bart. This is not a good time."
Bart Simpson,I saw you two fighting. I'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down.
,
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Skinner said you wouldn't have the wontons to go through with it."
Edna Krabappel,Skinner said that?
Bart Simpson,"Well, I had to clean it up a little."
,
Bart Simpson,"But basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want."
Seymour Skinner,She did?
Bart Simpson,Yeah. She said you'd fold faster than Superman on laundry day.
Seymour Skinner,"We'll see about that. Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative, but now I see you're really a very sensitive little boy."
Bart Simpson,"Thank you, sir."
Seymour Skinner,Aww.
,
Edna Krabappel,"Seymour, you're being totally unfair and the teachers won't stand for it."
Seymour Skinner,Teachers. You don't have the guts to strike.
Seymour Skinner,"Attention. This is an emergency broadcast. All is well in the school. My authority as principal is total -- Hey, gimme that."
Edna Krabappel,Attention teachers: we're on strike. Ha!
Lisa Simpson,Oh no. Strike?
Ralph Wiggum,"Miss Hoover, are you on s..."
Miss Hoover,"Go home, children!"

Ring Girl,Hello? Mrs. Pommelhorst? I'd like to get down now.

Dewey Largo,I heard that.
,
,
Marge Simpson,Bart! Lisa! What are you two doing home so early?
Bart Simpson,"Great news, Mom!"
Lisa Simpson,"Horrible news, Mom!"
Bart Simpson,The school's on strike. Maybe forever. Overload. Pleasure overload.
Lisa Simpson,"Luckily I've prepared for this, so I'm not too worried."
,
Lisa Simpson,Oh yeah.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, leave that crowbar here. You know I don't like you prying and jimmying."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Mom! Dad! Great news! The teachers are on --
Luann Van Houten,We heard.
Kirk Van Houten,And we already hired a tutor.
Tutor,Well. Looks like we'll be staying late today to make up for all this dilly-dallying.
Milhouse Van Houten,
,
Bart Simpson,Awesome.
Bart Simpson,"You with the crane, spin around real fast."
Bart Simpson,"Now you, dump three tons of sand onto that port-a-potty."
Foreman,"Hey, can't you tell my voice from a ten-year-old kid's? Ay carumba!"
,
,
Onlooker #1,"Hey, that little boy is playing three games at once."
Opponent #1,Check mate.
Homer Simpson,Lousy teachers. Trying to palm off our kids on us.
Lisa Simpson,"But Dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way."
Lisa Simpson,"I've got some textbooks, but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far."
Marge Simpson,"Honey, maybe you should relax a little?"
Lisa Simpson,"Relax? I can't relax. Nor can I yield, relent, or... Only two synonyms? Oh my God! I'm losing my perspicacity!"
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's always in the last place you look."
,
Lisa Simpson,"So if we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?"
Miss Hoover,Get away from me.
Edna Krabappel,"Good news, people!"
Teachers,"Yay!/ I knew they'd cave in./ You did it, Edna!"
Edna Krabappel,I'm happy to announce that another union has joined us in a sympathy strike: the piano tuners local 4-12!
,
Bart Simpson,Now for operation strike-make-go-longer.
Bart Simpson,"You know, I heard Skinner say the teachers will crack any minute."
Teacher,Skinner said the teachers will crack any minute purple monkey dishwasher.
Edna Krabappel,"Well, we'll show him - especially for that purple monkey dishwasher remark."
,
Gary Chalmers,"Seymour, you are truly incompetent."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I hardly think it's fair to..."
Gary Chalmers,"Dummy up, you. Listen to those passing motorists who support the teachers."
,
,
Tutor,"Fifteen minute recess, Milhouse. The recess assignment is chapters three through seven."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Yay, recess!"
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, I found a hive of killer bees. You wanna go throw rocks at it?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey cool! There's a rabbit in here.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sorry Bart, I'm deeply immersed in the Teapot Dome Scandal."
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Milhouse Van Houten,"However, it might be feasible in a fortnight."
Bart Simpson,Wuh?
Milhouse Van Houten,I can play in two weeks.
Bart Simpson,Juh?

DOLPH,I probably should stop. My doctor says I have the wrists of an eighty-year-old.
,
Bart Simpson,What do you mean the bank is out of money? Insolvent?! You only have enough cash for the next three customers?!
Manager,"Wait a minute. J-just a second here. No. No. I don't have your money here. It's in Bill's house, and a-a Fred's house...."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, what the hell are you doing with my money in your house, Fred?"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Grade me! Look at me! Evaluate and rank me! Oh -- I'm good, good, good, and oh so smart! Grade me!"
,
Marge Simpson,"I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat."
Homer Simpson,I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.
Marge Simpson,"And Bart isn't doing very well either. He needs boundaries, and structure. There's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome."
Bart Simpson,"Hello, mother dear."
Marge Simpson,That's it. We have to get them back to school.

Ned Flanders,"All right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?"
Seymour Skinner,Boo!
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, boo yourself. Our demands are simple: a small cost of living increase and some better equipment and supplies for your children."
Parents,Yay! / That's reasonable. / Give it to 'em.
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah, in a dream world. We have a very tight budget. To do what she's asking, we'd have to raise taxes."
Parents,Raise taxes! / They're too high as they are right now! / Taxes are bad. / We don't want that.
Edna Krabappel,It's your children's future.
Parents,That's true./ Children are important./ They're our future./ Best to plan.
Seymour Skinner,It'll cost you.
Parents,"Oh right, taxes. / I forgot that. / I don't have any extra money. / They're gonna raise taxes."
Edna Krabappel,C'mon.
Parents,She makes a good case./ Good point / Sounds logical.
Parents,"Oh right, the money. / That finger thing means taxes. / That means money./ I pay a lot of taxes."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree."
Seymour Skinner,I don't agree to that.
Edna Krabappel,Neither do I.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, this is a dilly of a pickle."
Panicky Man,Oh my God! The PTA has disbanded!
Ned Flanders,"No, no. The PTA has not disbanded."
Ned Flanders,We do have an emergency plan in case of a prolonged strike right here.
Ned Flanders,"Let's see. ""Replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""

Professor Jonathan Frink,"All right... so the compression and expansion of the longitudinal waves cause the erratic oscillation, you can see it there, of the neighboring particles... Yes, what is it? What? What is it?"
Tiny Student,Can I play with it?
Vendor,Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here.
Professor Jonathan Frink,"No, you can't play with it. You won't enjoy it on as many levels as I do. The colors children."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, when I call your name, ah, you say present, or here. No, say present. Anita Bath?"
Moe Szyslak,"All right, settle down. Anita Bath here! All right, fine, fine. Ah, Maya Buttreeks."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, what are you laughin' at? What? Oh, oh, I get it. I get it. It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it? Well children, I can't help that!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow Bart, I'm impressed the way you knocked off all those substitutes."
Bart Simpson,In my weaker moments I almost pity them. Then I just remind myself they're trying to teach.
Seymour Skinner,"Well children, I don't know what you did to all those substitutes, but it's going to stop now. Leopold?"
Leopold,"All right, you listen up you little freaks. The fun stops here. You're gonna shut your stinkin' traps and behave, dammit. This is one substitute you're not gonna screw with...Marge Simpson."
Marge Simpson,"Hello class. Hi Bart. Over here, sweetie. It's me, Mom. Hi. Hey. Hello."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm sure some of you already know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother."
Nelson Muntz,
Bart Simpson,Mo-om.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, what about the booby trap!"
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,May I?
Marge Simpson,Thank you.
All Students,Mama's boy!/ Who's the new teacher's pet?/ Goody-goody.
Milhouse Van Houten,I meant the other booby trap.
Marge Simpson,Ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
,
Homer Simpson,"So, how was everybody's day at school?"
Bart Simpson,Horrifying.
Lisa Simpson,Pointless.
Marge Simpson,Exhausting. It took the children forty minutes to locate Canada on the map.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there."
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test. Can I please go to the nurse?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, my teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes, he confiscated everything made of tin, and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener."
,
Jasper Beardly,
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, oh, okay... Hmmm. Um here."
Jasper Beardly,
Grampa Simpson,"Uh. Oh. Okay... Ah let's see. Um, what if I did this?"
Jasper Beardly,
Grampa Simpson,You're on your own.
Jasper Beardly,
Lisa Simpson,There's no way I'll get into an Ivy League school now. At this rate I probably won't even get into Vassar.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I've had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady."
Bart Simpson,"Look Mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf. How would you feel if I started moppin' the floor?"
Marge Simpson,I'd be thrilled. You can start right now.
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,And I'm gonna keep teaching your class. Like it or lump it.
Bart Simpson,"Well, then. I guess I'll just have to get into the crawl space again."
Marge Simpson,I hate it when he gets in there.
,
Bart Simpson,Psst. Over here.
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I need a dollar. Ever since you started teaching here, kids have been taking my lunch money. And I need that money for candy."
Marge Simpson,"Ah, here you go, precious. Now go off with your friends."
DOLPH,"""Here ya go, precious."""
Bart Simpson,Why isn't my mom stopping this?
DOLPH,We've created a diversion.
Marge Simpson,"That's a very nice jig, Kearney. Now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?"
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Yeah.
Bart Simpson,"That's it. I can't take this anymore, Milhouse. I've gotta get the real teachers back."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again. They're like two positively charged ions."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is wonderful! You're alive!"
Bart Simpson,"Zuh? Wait, that's it! With your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts, we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together."
,
Edna Krabappel,"A surprise party? For me? In Principal Skinner's office? Well I don't know, but all right..."
Seymour Skinner,"Me? Go to my office? It's highly irregular, but all right..."
,
Bart Simpson,...And you're not coming out until you reach an agreement.
Seymour Skinner,"Let us out, Bart! / This is not funny, come on! / Bart, let us out right now!"
Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, they'll start negotiating."
Edna Krabappel,Let us out! Let us out!
Seymour Skinner,"For the love of God, let us out!"
Edna Krabappel,Let us out-out-out.
Seymour Skinner,Come on! Or you are sooo sorry.
Seymour Skinner,"Come on! Or you are going to be very, very sorry."
,
Edna Krabappel,"Well Seymour, I guess we could start talking."
Seymour Skinner,What's the point? There's no more money. Unless you've got some magic new source of revenue.
Edna Krabappel,"Well, we've got to figure something out. They've got us locked in here like prisoners."
Seymour Skinner,Prisoners in our own school. Hey...
Seymour Skinner,This was a great way to make extra money. Renting out our cloakrooms to the overcrowded prison system.
,
Snake Jailbird,"Yo, I used to sit right over there."
Martin Prince,
Edna Krabappel,"It's all right, children. Just ignore the murderer."
Seymour Skinner,And as a bonus some of our more troublesome students might be scared straight.
Snake Jailbird,"Psst, kid. Help me break out of here, I'll totally make it worth your while."
Bart Simpson,I'm listening...
,
Bart Simpson,"No thanks to you, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Why you little...
Krusty the Clown,"Hey kids, it's story time! I'm gonna tell you the story of Krusty's expensive new suit. His sexual harassment suit. Anyway, as part of Krusty's plea bargain, he has a new court-ordered sidekick, Ms. No-Means-No."
Krusty the Clown,Whoa! You're hot! Let's get some dinner after the show!
Krusty the Clown,"I have dinner with all my employees, right Sideshow Mel?"
Sideshow Mel,We've never spoken outside of work.
Krusty the Clown,
,
Bart Simpson,I'm surprised he doesn't try to blame his problems on his Percodan addiction.
Krusty the Clown,"It wasn't my fault. It was the Percodan. If you ask me, that stuff rots your brain. And now a word from our new sponsor -- Percodan?! Aw crap."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, are you ready for your history test?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh you bet, Mom. Ask me anything."
Marge Simpson,OK. Who was George Washington Carver?
Bart Simpson,"Um, the guy who chopped up George Washington?"
Homer Simpson,Really? Wow.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you said you were going to study."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, my stomach!"
Marge Simpson,You just don't want to take that test.
Bart Simpson,No I mean it. It really hurts!
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I think he's serious."
Homer Simpson,"Kids are so naÃ¯ve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""Do Not Feed The Bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
Homer Simpson,"Now get to school, boy."
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test. I have a stomach ache."
Edna Krabappel,Well that's a lame excuse for an excuse. Ha!
Bart Simpson,"Look, if you ignore me and I die, you'd get in a lot of trouble."
Edna Krabappel,Read page six of the school charter.
Bart Simpson,No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies.
Edna Krabappel,We're also absolved if Milhouse gets eaten by the school snake.
Edna Krabappel,"Gosh, Bart, maybe you really are in pain. Well, it would be cruel not to let you go. Now you may go."
,
Bart Simpson,Lunchlady Doris! Why are you here?
Lunchlady Doris,Budget cuts. They've even got Groundskeeper Willie teaching French.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Bonjour, you cheese eatin' surrender monkeys."
Bart Simpson,"Look, my stomach really hurts."
Lunchlady Doris,All I can give you are these Chewable Prozac for Kids. Your choice: Manic Depressive Mouse.
Lunchlady Doris,Or the Bluebird of Unhappiness.
Seymour Skinner,"Superintendant Chalmers, I'd like you to meet our new school nurse, Lunchlady Doris."
Gary Chalmers,"Yeah. Nice to see you. Seymour, why is that student lying unconscious on the floor?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, in many cases the floor is the best... oh look! Here comes Lumpy, the school snake!"
Kids,Help! Help!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Lord."
,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Don't worry, son, you'll be fine. This boy's appendix is inflamed and about to burst, which will make it easier to find once I get in there ."
Homer Simpson,"Man, these are primo seats. I could really go for a hot dog."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is an operation!"
Vendor,Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Okay, Bart. I will count to three and you will be sound asleep! One... two... three!"
Dr. Nick Riviera,Out like a light!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Scalpel.
Bart Simpson,
Dr. Nick Riviera,Whoopsie. Hmmm. Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs...
Dr. Nick Riviera,Hey I smell gas. Pleasant gas. Night-night gas.
,
Marge Simpson,How's my special little guy?
Lisa Simpson,"How're you feelin', big brother?"
Maggie Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now Homer, please. The boy has just had a very serious operation."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now, Bart I found the culprit: a jagged metal cereal O."
,
Bart Simpson,Wicked. I got this cool scar and I get to miss a week of school.
Kids,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Doctor Hibbert, can I have my appendix out?"
Kids,"Yeah, me, too! Can I have mine out, too? Etc."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Why not? Follow me, kids! Nurse! Prep these children!"
Lisa Simpson,"I'm glad you're okay, Bart."
,
Lisa Simpson,Bleeding Gums Murphy!
Lisa Simpson,It's been a long time.
,
Lisa Simpson,Ew. How'd you get a name like that?
Lisa Simpson,Yeah.
Lisa Simpson,My brother just had his appendix out.
Bart Simpson,"Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks. I'm doing my rounds and uh, I'm a little behind."
Lisa Simpson,He'll be fine.
,
,
Lisa Simpson,What about your family?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Hey, I've got an older brother that I'll never see. He's a jazz musician or some such. Oh well. Bye-bye!"
Lisa Simpson,It must be awful to be all alone in the world.
,
Old Jazz Musician,I've been playing jazz for thirty years and I just can't make a go of it. I want you to have my saxophone.
Old Jazz Musician,So I've been playing an umbrella for thirty years? Why didn't anybody tell me?
Old Jazz Musician,That's not funny.
,
Steve Allen,"Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's inspired me to do some improv poetry."
Steve Allen,"Twinkle twinkle groovy cat/ How I wonder where you at/ I really love the way you cook/ Just like me when I wrote this book, ""How to Make Love to Steve Allen"""
Steve Allen,"From the author of ""Happiness is a Naked Steve Allen,"" ""Journey to the Center of Steve Allen,"" and ""The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen""."
,
Store Clerk,"Sir, don't you think you've had enough?"
,
Lisa Simpson,When was the last time you worked?
,
Cliff,"Hey, kids! Meet Grandpa Murphy!"
Rudi,But we have three grandpas already.
Cliff,This one's a great jazz musician.
Rudi,They all are.
Lisa Simpson,Your sax! Thank you so much!
,
,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Cliff,"You see, the kids they listen to the rap-music which gives them the brain damage. With their hippin' and the hoppin' and the bippin' and the boppin', so they don't know what the jazz is all about. You see, jazz is like a Jell-O Pudding Pop. No, actually it's more like Kodak film. No, actually jazz is like the New Coke -- it'll be around forever. Heh heh heh."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, you've had some career. Although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely."
Kent Brockman,"This just in. Krusty the clown staged a press conference today to defend himself against charges that his products are unsafe, his theme park is a death trap, and that he's marketing videos of Tanya Harding's wedding night."
,
Krusty the Clown,... And I contend that those tourists were decapitated before they entered the Krustyland House of Knives. Next question.
Reporter,What about that little boy who got appendicitis from eating your cereal?
Krusty the Clown,"To prove that this metal O is harmless I will personally eat one. See, there's nothing... Oh boy! This thing is shredding my insides!"
Sideshow Mel,"Uh, Krusty, that wasn't a metal one. That was a regular Krusty-O."
Krusty the Clown,It's poison!
,
Lisa Simpson,I sure am. Look!
Lisa Simpson,I stopped brushing my teeth so I can play just like you!
Lisa Simpson,"LIFT ME, WON'T YOU LIFT ME / ABOVE THE OLD ROUTINE / MAKE IT NICE, PLAY IT CLEAN, JAZZMAN..."
Lisa Simpson,"WHEN THE JAZZMAN'S TESTI-FYIN' A FAITHLESS MAN BELIEVES / HE CAN SING YOU INTO PARADISE / OR BRING YOU TO YOUR KNEES / JAZZMAN, OH JAZZMAN..."
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Moe, what'll you give me for an AA chip?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, Barney, this is a five-minute chip. Eh... it's worth a Pabst."
Marge Simpson,Marge!
Seymour Skinner,"Now I have learned that most of the orchestra is having their appendixes removed. So without further ado, I give you the remnants of the Springfield Elementary School Orchestra."
Seymour Skinner,"On saxophone, Lisa Simpson."
Seymour Skinner,"On triangle, Martin Prince."
Seymour Skinner,"And with a flute up his nose, Ralph Wiggum."
Ralph Wiggum,
Chief Wiggum,"That's some nice flutin', boy."
Seymour Skinner,They will be playing Stars and Stripes Forever -- hopefully not forever.
Grampa Simpson,It sucks.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Bleeding Gums! I was great! And I owe it all to..."
,
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,What happened to Mr. Murphy?
Nurse,I'm sorry. He passed away.
,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?"
Lisa Simpson,Bleeding Gums was my hero and I never got to tell him how I felt.
Homer Simpson,"Oh I'm sure he knew. And I'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy."
Lisa Simpson,But he was the only person who had the same love for music that I do.
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you. Oh Dad, why did he have to die?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's like the time that your cat, Snowball, got run over."
Lisa Simpson,Uh huh.
Homer Simpson,"Remember, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,"What I'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Dad!"
Homer Simpson,I blew it again.
Homer Simpson,Mmmmmm.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lisa. Are you still upset about that jazz guy?"
Bart Simpson,"If it helps, I believe that after you die, you can come back as whatever you want. I'll be a butterfly."
Lisa Simpson,How come?
Bart Simpson,Because nobody ever suspects the butterfly.
,
Seymour Skinner,"I didn't burn down the school. It was the butterfly, I tell you! The butterfly!"
Chief Wiggum,"He's crazy, boys. Get the taser."
Bart Butterfly,
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, maybe I need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom."
,
Grampa Simpson,Death stalks you at every turn!
Lisa Simpson,Grampa!
Grampa Simpson,"Well, it does. Death! There it is! Death!"
Lisa Simpson,It's only Maggie.
Grampa Simpson,"Oh yeah. You know, at my age, the mind starts playing tricks, 'til... Death!"
Lisa Simpson,That's only the cat.
Grampa Simpson,Oh. Death!
Lisa Simpson,"That's Maggie again, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,Oh. Where were we? Death!
,
Lisa Simpson,How come it won't stop hurting?
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and Bleeding Gums was a good friend to you. But nobody is really gone as long as we remember them."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, I recommend getting a tattoo. It preserves the things you love."
Homer Simpson,Starland Vocal Band?! They suck!
Grampa Simpson,Death!
,
Lisa Simpson,Isn't anybody gonna show up?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well Lisa, we've waited an hour. Dearly beloved... we are gathered here today to bid farewell to Blood-n-Guts Murphy."
Lisa Simpson,No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy was quite the sousaphone player."
Lisa Simpson,Saxophone! He was a jazz musician.
Lisa Simpson,You didn't know him! Nobody knew him! But he was a great man! And I won't rest until all of Springfield knows the name of Bleeding Gums Murphy!
Homer Simpson,And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is a cemetery."
Marge Simpson,"What do you do, follow my husband around?"
Vendor,"Lady, he's putting my kids through college."
,
Lionel Hutz,"Good news, Bart! The Krusty-O Cereal Corp. has settled your case for one hundred thousand dollars... less, of course, my legal fees."
Bart Simpson,What kind of legal fees?
Lionel Hutz,"Well, for a case this complex, I had to assemble a crack team of lawyers."
Lionel Hutz,"Ronald Chaporo, trial attorney. Albert Dershman, who can hold three billiard balls in his mouth."
Bart Simpson,How much of the hundred thou do I get?
Bart Simpson,Five hundred dollars!
Lionel Hutz,"Yes, well, er..."
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Lionel Hutz,Glad you're happy. Let's roll.
Bart Simpson,I can't believe it! Five hundred bucks! Just think what I can do with that money!
Bart Simpson,Five hundred dollars on red.
Croupier,The winner is black.
Bart Simpson,Cool.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I want to honor Bleeding Gums' memory, but I don't know where to start."
Marge Simpson,"Hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him."
Homer Simpson,Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
Marge Simpson,That's Mary Had a Little Lamb.
Homer Simpson,"OK, then this. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo"
Marge Simpson,That's the same thing! You just replaced dees with doos!
Homer Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, I have a request. I would like you to do a tribute to Bleeding Gums Murphy, please."
Dj,"I'd love to, little sister, but we don't have his album."
Lisa Simpson,What if I could find it?
Dj,"Well, I'd spin it for ya, but you know, ain't no one gonna hear it. Our broadcast range is only twenty-three feet, which makes us the most powerful jazz station in the entire U.S. of A."
Lisa Simpson,"Gee, your station has a lot of problems."
Dj,Tell me about it. Just look at our morning guy.
Hans Moleman,"Hello. This is ""Moleman in the Morning."" Good Moleman to you. Today, part four of our series of the agonizing pain in which I live every day."
,
Lisa Simpson,Two hundred and fifty dollars! But I need that album to honor the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy.
Comic Book Guy,He's dead? Well why didn't you say so?
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,Where am I gonna get five hundred dollars?
Lisa Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now drive, Smithers, drive!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Excuse me, my good man, I have five hundred dollars to blow. What have you got?"
Comic Book Guy,Behold... the ultimate POG.
Bart Simpson,I'll take it!
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, look what I've got!"
Bart Simpson,Ta-daa!
Lisa Simpson,Bart! I can't believe it... But why?
Bart Simpson,"When I said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me."
Lisa Simpson,Oh thank you. But five hundred dollars! You'll never see that much money again!
Bart Simpson,Oh yeah? Take a look at this:
,
Lisa Simpson,I got the album!
Dj,"Here, you can listen to it on this."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums."
Lisa Simpson,
Dispatcher,Attention all units! Attention all units! Poison gas cloud heading towards...
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, that's nice."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, it's getting cloudy! Oh boy."
,
Lisa Simpson,"That was for you, Bleeding Gums."
Snake Jailbird,Just pick the red card. It's totally not hard.
Lion's Head,"You must avenge my death, Kimba... er, I mean... Simba!"
Darth,"Luke, I am your father!"
Black Man,This is CNN!
Black Man,We're sorry.
Lisa Simpson,I don't want you to go!

,
,
Marge Simpson,Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
Homer Simpson,They're butchering the classics. Could that bassoon have come in any more late?
Marge Simpson,"Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers."
Homer Simpson,"Laser effects, mirrored balls. John Williams must be rolling around in his grave."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Devilishishly satirical. I wonder if anyone else got that?
Homer Simpson,We're outta here!
,
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, careful now. These are dangerous streets for us upper-lower-middle-class types... So avoid eye contact, watch your pocketbook and suspect everyone."
Snake Jailbird,Three Card Monte.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Easy money!
Marge Simpson,"Homie, these games are fixed."
Homer Simpson,Then how come that guy's winning?
Shill,"Whoa, I like totally won again."
Snake Jailbird,"Way to go, bro."
Marge Simpson,He looks and acts just like the dealer. I think they're related or at least in cahoots.
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Twenty on this one, my good man."
Snake Jailbird,Sorry dude. Black.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, he cheated you."
Crowd,Cheater. / Thief. / You're giving Three Card Monte a bad name.
Snake Jailbird,Surely you don't blame me.
Marge Simpson,"It's people like you who are ruining our downtown promenades and piazzas. How dare you prey on the greedy and stupid, like this."
Snake Jailbird,Ba-bye!
Marge Simpson,Somebody stop him!
Marge Simpson,He's getting away!! C'mon! C'mon!
Homer Simpson,No Marge!!
Homer Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Uh, I must warn you, um, uh, sometimes ordinary people g-g-get a surge of uh- adrenaline. Wee-aah!"
Snake Jailbird,Ugh.
Marge Simpson,See?...
Chief Wiggum,"Cuff him boys, we're puttin' this dirtbag away."
Snake Jailbird,Ha! I'll be back on the streets in twenty four hours.
Chief Wiggum,We'll try to make it twelve.
,
Marge Simpson,"Ah, I think I'm okay. It was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman."
Marge Simpson,Oh for crying out loud...
Homer Simpson,"Easy now, sweetheart. Homie's here."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey Mom, is this how you caught him?"
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, please, you're too puny to --"
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, unhand your brother."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, like that really hurt."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, it was pretty exciting, but celery soup's pretty exciting too."
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Strange, regular ham doesn't thrill me anymore. I'm crossing over to deviled ham. Whoa!"
News Vendor,"Hey, Mrs. Simpson, I just got the new issue of ""Sponge and Vacuum."""
Marge Simpson,Thanks Benevenstanciano.
Marge Simpson,Death sports.
Chief Wiggum,"All right, get in there."
Lou,You're goin' down.
Eddie,I wan-a piece of him!
,
Chief Wiggum,"Yoo-- think you're pretty hot, eh? Well, we've got everything we need on you."
Marge Simpson,Excuse me...
Chief Wiggum,"What, what, what, what, what, what, what? This better be about pizza."
Marge Simpson,"Actually, I'm interested in becoming a police officer."
Chief Wiggum,Welcome aboard.
,
Homer Simpson,You did what?!!
,
Bart Simpson,"I borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?"
Homer Simpson,Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
Bart Simpson,Cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions?
Marge Simpson,"You got it, little buddy."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. And I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks, honey."
,
Chief Wiggum,"All right, you scrawny beanpoles, becoming a cop is not something that happens overnight... it takes one solid weekend of training to get that badge."
Psychotic Guy,Forget about the badge!! When do we get the freakin' guns?!
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, I told you, you don't get your gun until you tell me your name."
Psychotic Guy,"I've had it up to here with your ""rules."""
,
Marge Simpson,
Chief Wiggum,Women always have trouble with the wall. Can't ever seem to find the door.
,
Chief Wiggum,"You missed the baby, you missed the blind man."
,
Marge Simpson,
Chief Wiggum,"Sorry, Simpson. You'll have to do the course again. I was trying to get this uh, magic eye thing to work. Look at that, heh, a pony."
,
Marge Simpson,"Hey everybody, Mom's home."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"They didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea."
,
Bart Simpson,"Wow, Mom, I never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I want you to take care of yourself out there. You've become very dear to me."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, of course I will."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet?"
Marge Simpson,I suppose I would.
Bart Simpson,What if they shot at a coke machine?
Marge Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,TV?
Marge Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,TV with a picture of the mayor on it?
Lisa Simpson,"Whatever you do, mom, we'll be proud of you."
Marge Simpson,"Well, thank you, honey."
Lisa Simpson,As long as it's constitutional.
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, give me my pepper spray."
Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, one squirt and you're south of the border."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Incapacitating.
,
Chief Wiggum,"All right, settle people. People settle. People. Wood and Van Zuylen, stake out Donutland. When they fry up a fresh batch, call it in. Keneally and Erhart, back 'em up."
Chief Wiggum,"Fitz and Garcia, it's your turn to sleep in."
Chief Wiggum,"And Simpson, seeing how this is your first day, you're inexperienced and vulnerable, your beat is Junkyville and Bumtown."
,
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Hutz."
Milhouse Van Houten,Is Bart home?
Lionel Hutz,"I'll have you know the contents of that dumpster are private. you stick your nose in, you'll be violating attorney/dumpster confidentiality."
Marge Simpson,I just wanted to say hello.
Lionel Hutz,Oh... hello .
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"So, you are the new cop on the beat. Okay, I know the drill. What will it be? One hundred? Two hundred?"
Marge Simpson,"Two hundred. No! No! I mean, I mean nothing. I don't take bribes."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Yes. Of course you don't. I will just leave this money on the table with my unseeing back to the money on the table.
Marge Simpson,"Apu, no."
Marge Simpson,That's better.
,
Marge Simpson,I got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, indeed there is. There's an inflatable bath pillow that mother and I both enjoy. She claimed it was her day to use it. I maintain she was mistaken. We quarreled. Later, as I prepared to bathe, I noticed to my horror, that ""someone"" had slashed the pillow."
Marge Simpson,Um-hmmm. Who called the police?
Agnes Skinner,We both did.
Marge Simpson,"Look, why don't you two settle down. I'm sure you can get another pillow."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I could send it back to Taiwan for repair, but why should I have to? I've done nothing wrong. And I don't give permission for my face to be on TV. I want it blurred."
,
Lisa Simpson,"So, Mom, what are you gonna do with your day off?"
Marge Simpson,I just want to relax and forget that I'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .
Marge Simpson,"Bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet."
Bart Simpson,But Mom--
Marge Simpson,It's for your own safety.
,
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Take that, safety boy."
Jimbo Jones,This padding's so easy on the knuckles. I could punch all day.
Bart Simpson,Ugh!
,
Maude Flanders,"I just hope they have ""Us"" magazine in heaven."
Agnes Skinner,He said it was his day to use the tub pillow.
Edna Krabappel,"I can't go to the library anymore, everybody stinks."
Marge Simpson,"Don't stop talking on account of me. I may be a cop, but I'm still your friend."
Marge Simpson,"So, how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?"
Edna Krabappel,Law abiding. I'm done.
Marge Simpson,"Moe, I've never seen you here before."
Moe Szyslak,"These days my roots don't stay so chestnut on their own, Officer Simpson."
Marge Simpson,"You don't have to call me ""Officer."" I'm not on duty here."
Hairdresser,Finished.
Marge Simpson,Whoa!
Helen Lovejoy,
Marge Simpson,"Oh. Uh, a looks nice. It's a, it's a good length for you."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom's police tape isn't a toy, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Shush, dear, you'll wreck Daddy's fun."
Ned Flanders,"Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... Oh my Lord!! Something horrible has happened!"
Homer Simpson,". Fooled you Flanders. Made you think your family was dead. Didja get it? They're not, though."
Ned Flanders,Oh.
Homer Simpson,But you thought they were.
Ned Flanders,Yeah.
,
Ned Flanders,That's a good one.
,
Marge Simpson,"And that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I know your intentions are good, but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites? Don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?"
Marge Simpson,"Look, Lisa. It's McGriff the Crime Dog."
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Lisa. Help me bite crime. Ruff, ruff."
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, great news, guys. I picked up a nudie deck for our game."
Homer Simpson,"""The Girls of the Internet."" Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, hey, hey, we've offended Herman."
Herman Hermann,"No, I'm just goin' out for some fresh air."
Moe Szyslak,"That guy sure likes his fresh air. None of that for me. Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
Carl Carlson,"Hey, Homer, you sure it's okay to smoke Cuban cigars and gamble here now that your uh, wife's a cop?"
,
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, please, please, ix-nay on the ohammar-may."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, hurry it up with the cards, Lenny. I've got you clocked at two miles per hour."
Lenny Leonard,"C'mon, put that away. Those radar guns give you cancer."
Homer Simpson,"All the more reason to hurry up. Hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --"
Marge Simpson,Illegal gambling in my house?!
Moe Szyslak,"Yo-your house?! Your house? Gee, it's so glamorously decorated I thought I was in Vegas. Hey you guys lied to me! You said it was Vegas!"
Players,"We'll be goin'... / We'll just be goin'... / We don't want no trouble, officer..."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you chased away all my poker buddies."
Marge Simpson,I didn't mean to.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you've become such a cop! And, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs."
Marge Simpson,"I'm still all those things. Only now I'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system."
Homer Simpson,You're cooking what for dinner?
,
Marge Simpson,"Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law. Dog, no leash. Man littering. Horse not wearing diaper. Car parked across three handicapped spaces..."
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge. How's my little piglet?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'm on duty."
Homer Simpson,"That's okay. I'm supposed to be workin', too."
Marge Simpson,You have to move your car.
Homer Simpson,"I'll just be a second, Marge. I'm going to get some beer for those kids over there."
Marge Simpson,"I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now."
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back. Now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's it. I'm gonna write you a ticket."
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, we're family."
Marge Simpson,You're breaking the law.
Homer Simpson,"I'll make you a deal. You rip up that ticket, and I'll give you back your hat. Wuh, wuh, wuh! Hee, hee-hee!"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense."
Homer Simpson,"What're you gonna do about it? What're you gonna do? Ooh, I'm Officer Marge, I'm gonna arrest you! Whoa! etc."
Homer Simpson,"Whuh! Marge, not here. Hey, you're not really arresting me...?"
Marge Simpson,You have the right to remain silent...
Homer Simpson,I choose to waive that right.
,
Homer Simpson,
Chief Wiggum,"All right, Simpson, you're free to go."
Homer Simpson,Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"All right, Hans. Time to go."
Hans Moleman,"But, he ate my last meal."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, if that's the worst thing that happens to you today, consider yourself lucky."
Hans Moleman,Are you really allowed to execute people in a local jail?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"From this point on, no talking."
,
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry I had to arrest you, Homer. But what I did was right. Someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there."
Homer Simpson,"I have nothing more to say to you, Marge. I'm drawing a line down the center of the house Ã  la ""I Love Lucy"" -- you stay on your side and I'll stay on my side."
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, when Marge first told me she was going to the Police Academy, I thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""Spaceballs."" But instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""Police Academy."""
Barney Gumble,"Hey, Homer, I'm worried about the beer supply. After this case and the other case, there's only one case left."
Barney Gumble,"Yeah, yeah, Barney's right. / Yeah. / Let's get some more beer. / Hey what about some beer? / Yeah, Barney's right!"
Homer Simpson,"All right guys, pipe down. I've got some more in the garage."
Herman Hermann,"I'll, I'll-I'll get it, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Hmm... I wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
Moe Szyslak,"""Garage?"" Hey fellas - ""the garage"". Ooo la de da, Mr. Frenchman."
Homer Simpson,"Well, what do you call it?"
Moe Szyslak,A car-hole.
,
Sinister Man,"You're late, Herman."
Herman Hermann,"Surely you don't mind waiting for merchandise of this quality, Mr. Jericho."
Sinister Man,"Ah, looks like good stuff. But, of course, I'll have to sample it first."
Sinister Man,"Well, these are fabulous."
Herman Hermann,"Yeah, who would suspect that they're... counterfeit jeans."
Sinister Man,And what better place to make the buy than in a cop's garage where no one would suspect a thing.
Homer Simpson,"Hey Herman, I had to come out here to see what's so funny - A counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! I'm gonna tell everyone! Wait here."
Herman Hermann,Not so fast.
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Herman Hermann,Maybe you should just stop entirely.
Homer Simpson,"Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
Herman Hermann,"Advance on him, men."
Marge Simpson,I don't think that's a very good idea.
Henchman,"Oh, no. It's Gloria Vanderbilt out for revenge!"
Marge Simpson,"No, it's Officer Simpson - of the police!"
Homer Simpson,"Herman, your beef is with me. Leave the girl out of this."
Herman Hermann,Okay.
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"It's too late for me, Marge! Sell the jeans and live like a queen."
,
Grampa Simpson,Just taking Maggie for a stroll.
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess I am putting up the Halloweenie decorations a little early. Criticism accepted."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Marge!
Lisa Simpson,"Bust 'im, Mom! / Get 'im, Mom! / Nail 'im! / You can do it!"
Marge Simpson,Go back to bed! Don't make me come up there!
,
Herman Hermann,Looks like your wife is embarking up the wrong tree.
Marge Simpson,Freeze!
Marge Simpson,Freeze! Every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. You saved my life! I'm sorry I teased you. You're a really good cop. I'm proud of you."
Herman Hermann,"So long, gotta catch the 501."
Homer Simpson,"He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!"
Marge Simpson,I don't think so.
Herman Hermann,Oh! Foiled by my own shoddy merchandise. Gee!
,
Grampa Simpson,That's my ambulance! I called for it four hours ago.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, how did you know..."
Marge Simpson,That the pants would rip?...
Homer Simpson,"No, what I was wondering is..."
Marge Simpson,"Years of buying pants for two active children and a full-seated husband has given me a sixth sense for shoddy stitching, which these jeans have in spades."
Chief Wiggum,"That's some nice work, Simpson. But um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence."
Homer Simpson,"Yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans."
Chief Wiggum,"Ah, they've uh, mysteriously, uh, disappeared."
Chief Wiggum,"Looking good, boys."
Marge Simpson,That's it! There's too much corruption on this force. I quit!
Chief Wiggum,"Sorry to lose you, Simpson."
,
Lenny Leonard,I don't think they're comin' back.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, that does it. That does it! I'm lookin' at his cards."
Moe Szyslak,Aw crap. I fold.
,
Edna Krabappel,I tried.
Bart Simpson,"Wet cement! Is there any sweeter sign? Well, maybe ""High Voltage."""
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Hello son, you want to try this flying motorcycle I just invented?"
Bart Simpson,No time.
Professor Jonathan Frink,Okay.
Bart Simpson,This is for the ages.
Tour Guide,"Like Stonehenge, this site will forever be a mystery. Who was ""Bart,"" and how did he manage to write his name in solid cement?"
1st Tourist,"He must have been much smarter than his sister Lisa, about whom we know nothing."
2nd Tourist,"Say, let's bring him back to life by using technology."
Bart Simpson,Ay caramba!
1st Tourist,What's normal to him amazes us.
2nd Tourist,He will be our new God.
Bart Simpson,"Aah. Oh, good, somebody's shadow. I'll just turn and brag about my work."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you've graffito-tagged public property."
Bart Simpson,It was an accident.
,
Marge Simpson,"I can't believe you vandalized your own home town, Bart. What would Jebediah Springfield say?"
Bart Simpson,I think he'd be cool with it.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?"
Homer Simpson,What for? Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I am just shocked by this whole family. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?"
Lisa Simpson,It's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
Marge Simpson,Now just a darned minute! This town is a part of who you are.
Marge Simpson,"This is a Springfield Isotopes cap. When you wear it, you're wearing Springfield. When you eat a fish from our river, you're eating Springfield. When you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking Springfield."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, when you give that lecture, you're boring Springfield."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. This town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. Sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember."
,
Marge Simpson,This town is a part of us all... a part of us all... a part of us all...
Bart Simpson,"Wow, that does work."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, gonna win some this season?"
Outfielder,Gonna try!
,
Nelson Muntz,"When it comes to catchin' trout, nothin' beats the German light infantry."
Bart Simpson,"Beautiful, aren't they?"
Nelson Muntz,"Yup, I'm gonna huck 'em at cars."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse. How's the lemonade business?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"It's clearly booming, Bart!"
Lisa Simpson,I don't even want any. I just bought a pity glass...
Milhouse Van Houten,We've squozen our whole supply! To the lemon tree!
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Thar she grows!
Bart Simpson,"You know Milhouse, I've been thinking. This town ain't so bad. Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings -- when you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live."
Shelby,Springfield sucks!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man."
Shelby,Why don't you make me?
Bart Simpson,"I don't make trash, I burn it."
Shelby,Then I guess you're a garbage man.
Bart Simpson,"Well, I know you are, but what am I?"
Shelby,A garbage man.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I know you are, but what am I?"
Shelby,A garbage man.
Bart Simpson,"I know you are, but what am I?"
Shelby,A garbage man.
Bart Simpson,Takes one to know one.
Database,Check mate.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey kid, stop wearing your backpack over one shoulder. We invented that, copycats!"
Backpack Kid,Aw. You copied us!
Milhouse Van Houten,Step over this line and say that. I'll kick your butt. At Nintendo.
Shelby,I just put a rock in your crummy town.
Bart Simpson,That's a crud rock. It belongs in crud town.
Shelby,"Look at the weak little baby. You're stupid, you stupid weak baby. Come on, let's get outta here."
Bart Simpson,Hey! They're taking our lemons!
Milhouse Van Houten,We can't spare a single one!
Shelbyville Kids,Ow! Ow!
Shelby,"You just got citric acid in my eye. You'll pay for that, Springfield."
Grampa Simpson,Aah! Some things never change.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, everybody, an old man's talking."
Kids,
Grampa Simpson,Grampa's the name. Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times?
Grampa Simpson,"Shut up! It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan..."
Springfield,"People, our search is over! On this site we shall build a new town, where we can worship freely, govern justly, and grow vast fields of hemp for making rope and blankets."
Shelbyville,Yes! And marry our cousins.
Springfield,"I was... Wha.. What are you talking about, Shelbyville? Why would we want to marry our cousins?"
Shelbyville,"Because they're so attractive. I-I, I thought that was the whole point of this journey."
Springfield,Absolutely not!
Shelbyville,"I tell you, I won't live in a town that robs men of the right to marry their cousins."
Springfield,"Well, then we'll form our own town! Who will come and live a life devoted to chastity, abstinence, and a flavorless mush I call ""rootmarm""?"
Grampa Simpson,The town of Springfield was born on that day. And to mark that sweet moment our people planted this lemon tree. Lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time.
,
Bart Simpson,Those Shelbyville kids think they're so hot. But you know what? They're not.
Milhouse Van Houten,"I really agree with you on this one, Bart."
Edna Krabappel,"Class, please. If you don't learn Roman Numerals, you'll never know the dates certain motion pictures were copyrighted."
Nelson Muntz,Everybody come quick! Something's happened! No time to explain!
Edna Krabappel,"No, children, no. Your-your education is important. Roman Numerals. Etcetera. Whatever."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Are you sure it wouldn't be faster to just tell us what happened?
Nelson Muntz,"No. I said there's no time to explain, and I stick by that."
,
Bart Simpson,The lemon tree's gone!
Martin Prince,And the tracks appear to lead into Shelbyville.
Database,"Oh. Look, a clue! A candy bar wrapper!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, they're always eating candy in Shelbyville. They love the sweet taste."
Bart Simpson,We gotta get that tree back!
Database,"Euh. You mean, go into Shelbyville? Euh. We'll never make it out alive!"
Bart Simpson,"That lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the backbone of our economy. We'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead."
,
Marge Simpson,"Where you going, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, you won't believe this, but something you said the other day really got through to me."
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,And now I am going to teach some kids a lesson.
Marge Simpson,I choose to take that literally.
Bart Simpson,Death to Shelbyville!
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse -- get your invasion supplies and let's go!"
,
Tough Kid,What the -- ? Where'd he go?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Over here, my friends. Or is it over here?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeah.
,
Bart Simpson,"Okay, here's how it goes. I'm the leader. Milhouse is my loyal sidekick. Nelson is the tough guy, Martin's the smart guy and Todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin' crazy. And now, the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. To step out of childhood and become men."
,
Bart Simpson,"If you get lost remember, you can always find east by staring directly at the sun."
Martin Prince,"Here's a tip. Put a pinch of sage in your boots, and all day long a spicy scent is your reward."
Milhouse Van Houten,Oh my gosh-- look!
Milhouse Van Houten,The fire hydrants here are yellow.
Nelson Muntz,This place is startin' to freak me out.
Todd Flanders,Danger coming. Behind us.
Backpack Kid,What is it boy? Is there something behind that wall we should beat up?
Shelby,No time to check it out now. We've got lemonade to sell.
Backpack Kid,Radical.
Bart Simpson,They're gettin' rich off us!
Milhouse Van Houten,"And that kid with the backpack said ""radical!"" I say ""radical."" That's my thing that I say. I feel like I'm gonna explode here!"
,
Marge Simpson,It's almost lunch time. Do you know where your brother is tutoring?
Lisa Simpson,Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching is guerilla combat in Shelbyville.
Marge Simpson,"Well, do you have a number where we can reach him?"
Lisa Simpson,"No, Mom! Bart and some kids ran off to wage war on Shelbyville."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, come quick! Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang!"
,
Database,"Euh. The trail has become indistinct. I suggest we split up, to cover more ground."
Bart Simpson,"Good idea. Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team. Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force. Nelson, that leaves you and Martin."
Martin Prince,Team Discovery Channel!
Nelson Muntz,Your wussy-ness better come in handy.
,
Parents,"Hey, where's my... / What's going on?/ I want some answers, damnit!"
Ned Flanders,"Okay, okay folks, look. I called the Police Captain in Shelbyville. He says he hasn't seen our kids, but if they show up in the morgue he's gonna fax us."
Kirk Van Houten,"Man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks!"
Luann Van Houten,"Honey, I was born in Shelbyville."
Kirk Van Houten,And it tears me up inside.
Marge Simpson,"This is my fault. I tried to teach Bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness."
Shelby,We just got word there's Springfield kids in town!
Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech..."
Marge Simpson,Isn't there anything we can do?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, there is. Come on, everybody, let's go into Shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! I got an R.V. we can use... Flanders's!"
Dads,Yeah!/ Let's do it!/ Yeah!
Ned Flanders,"Well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the..."
Homer Simpson,"Pile in, everybody! No time to wipe your feet!"
,
Martin Prince,"Okay piglet, start squealing! Where'd you get the lemons for this lemonade?"
Small Kid,"Ah. This is Countrytime Lemonade Mix. There's never been anything close to a lemon in it, I swear!"
Bigger Kid,Hey! Nobody hassles my little brother.
Martin Prince,"Hey, and no one manhandles the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz. Spring forth burly protector and save me!"
Nelson Muntz,"Oh, geez. I never hang out with him, normally."
Martin Prince,Hark to the tale of Nelson and the boy he loved so dear...
Martin Prince,They remained the best of friends for years and years and years!
,
Milhouse Van Houten,What are they saying?
Bart Simpson,I'm not sure.
Milhouse Van Houten,I thought you said you could read lips.
Bart Simpson,I assumed I could.
Bart Simpson,"Aw. It's no use, Milhouse. If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover. What I need is a new face."
Milhouse Van Houten,You leave that to the Baron and me.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians."
1st Kid,"Wait a minute. If you're from Shelbyville, how come we've never seen you at school?"
Bart Simpson,I don't go to school.
2nd Kid,Okay. What's two plus two?
Bart Simpson,Five.
1st Kid,"Eh, story checks out..."
Bart Simpson,Curse those handsome devils.
Shelby,"We're going up to the bluffs to paint ""Springfield Sucks"" in huge letters. That way, whenever they look into Shelbyville, they will realize that they suck."
Backpack Kid,"Uh, radical."
Milhouse Van Houten,Quit copying me--!
Shelby,"You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now. I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs."
Bart Simpson,"No, not in my mouth! Aye--is what the kid would say. To the bluffs!"
,
Ned Flanders,"Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
Gas Station Attendant,Missing children?
Customer,Sounds like Springfield's got a discipline problem.
Second Customer,Maybe that's why we beat 'em at football nearly half the time. Huh?
,
Shelby,"Quit stallin', kid. Write ""Springfield Sucks"" in giant letters."
Bart Simpson,
Shelby,His can control is excellent.
2nd Kid,Yes. And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the Beatles.
Bart Simpson,"That's right. The stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson!"
Shelbyville Kids,Huh?
Bart Simpson,"You know, Bart Simpson. From Springfield?"
Shelby,He's from Springfield! Get him!
Bart Simpson,"I'll use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety. So long, losers!"
Bart Simpson,
Shelby,You're dead.
Bart Simpson,"Uh... hey, look! Someone's attractive cousin."
Shelbyvillers,Huh? Really? Where? Lemme see.
Bart Simpson,
Shelby,"So he thinks he can out skateboard me, huh? Launch me, boys!"
Groundskeeper Wilma,"Slow down, you sidewalk surfin' cube- gleamers!"
Bart Simpson,"Uh oh, wet cement!"
Bart Simpson,I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
Professor Jonathan Frink,You had your chance.
Bart Simpson,Safe at last!
,
Bart Simpson,CAUTION: Exit through door seven only. All other rooms contain man-eating tigers.
Bart Simpson,Roman Numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school.
Bart Simpson,Milhouse! What's seven in Roman Numerals?
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"I'll tell you, Bart. But you really should end each transmission with the word ""over"". Over."
Backpack Kid,Correction -- the only thing that's over is that transmission.
Milhouse Van Houten,Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?
Backpack Kid,But... Milhouse is my name.
Milhouse Van Houten,I thought I was the only one.
Backpack Kid,A pain I know all too well.
Milhouse Van Houten,"So this is what it feels like, when doves cry..."
,
Bart Simpson,Milhouse! Milhouse! Now what do I do?
Bart Simpson,Wait! I got it! I got it!
Bart Simpson,I don't got it.
Bart Simpson,"Okay. Think, Bart. Where have you seen Roman Numerals before? I know, ""Rocky Vee!"" That was the fifth one. So ""Rocky Five"" plus ""Rocky Two"" equals ""Rocky Seven: Adrian's Revenge!"""
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, it's no use. I'm never gonna find that tree. This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there. Wait a minute! There's a lemon behind that rock."
Bart Simpson,The tree!
Bart Simpson,
,
Martin Prince,"A car impound lot, the impenetrable fortress of suburbia."
Milhouse Van Houten,We'll never get the tree back now!
Bart Simpson,"Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't come this far to get found out."
Homer Simpson,Found 'em!
Homer Simpson,"You kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this."
Bart Simpson,But they stole our lemon tree!
Homer Simpson,"I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!"
,
Executive #3,Package for parcel processing. Pronto.
Homer Simpson,That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
Tow Truck Man,Bust in here and take it? You must be stupider than you look.
Homer Simpson,Stupider like a fox!
Homer Simpson,I'm okay.
Tow Truck Man,"Hu-hu-hu-hu. Don't you get it, Springfield? It's over. You lose. Now if you'll excuse me, all this talk has made me hungry."
,
Homer Simpson,"This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, I'll be in the shower."
Bart Simpson,"There's got to be a way to get that tree back. Hey, look. A hospital! Pull in there."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down."
,
Tow Truck Man,"Oh, dear. Some thoughtless human being has parked in a hospital zone."
Tow Truck Man,"AND I THINK TO MYSELF, WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD..."
,
Homer Simpson,No one in history has ever done anything this clever.
Bart Simpson,I'll get the gate.
Homer Simpson,"That's okay, son. I'll take care of him."
Homer Simpson,"Faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!"
,
,
Tow Truck Man,"Get out here, son -- there's-a doin's transpiring!"
Tow Truck Man,Let's shut the gate and seal them in!
,
Bart Simpson,"Gun it, Flanders!"
Ned Flanders,It won't start! Something's draining the battery?!
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Ned Flanders,
Bart Simpson,We made it!
Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo!
Bart Simpson,"Eat my shorts, Shelbyville!"
Bart Simpson,Eat my shorrrrrrrts!
Ned Flanders,Yes. Eat all of our shirts.
Tow Truck Man,"Ooh! Ya lousy Springfielder! Shake harder, boy!"
,
,
Waylon Smithers,"Perk up, Prendergast. Profoundly pressing package of power plant profit projections for Pete Porter in Pasadena."
Grampa Simpson,"And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield. They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil, and though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee, he could easily afford it."
Milhouse Van Houten,"More lemonade, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Absolutely.
Milhouse Van Houten,Say when.
Shelbyville Grampa,"And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Shelbyville. They had banished the awful lemon tree forever, because it was haunted. Now let's all celebrate with a cool glass of turnip juice."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, is there nothing so intoxicating as the school hallway at early morn?"
Seymour Skinner,Hmm. School normally doesn't smell so... rank.
Seymour Skinner,Ahh. Washbasin fresh. That funk must be coming from one of the classrooms.
,
Seymour Skinner,Poor fellow. Crushed by his own water bottle...
Seymour Skinner,"Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, er, Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial."
Groundskeeper Willie,
Groundskeeper Willie,Yer lucky yer getting a decent burial! Me own father got thrown in the bog!
Groundskeeper Willie,What in the name of St. Ephesiocritus?!
Groundskeeper Willie,
Bart Simpson,Yuck. What reeks?
Nelson Muntz,Smells like one of Van Houten's!
Milhouse Van Houten,It does not!
Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover? The floor is shaking.
Miss Hoover,Ralph. Remember the time you thought the --
Ralph Wiggum,Mommmmy!!!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, before we adjourn, gentlemen, I have one last matter of utmost importance. I need to send this parcel with the profit projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena - And it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight!"
Executive #1,Pete Porter. Pass it on.
Executive #2,Pasadena. Promptly.
Prendergast,Priority?
Waylon Smithers,Precisely.
Homer Simpson,"Here's your package, Mr. Burns!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"My name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! Smithers, who is this nincompoop?"
Homer Simpson,--son!
C. Montgomery Burns,Sounded large when I ordered it. I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby-traps.
,
Seymour Skinner,My Lord. Such destruction.
Seymour Skinner,Superintendent Chalmers! How are you going?
Gary Chalmers,"Why is it when I heard the word ""school"" and the word ""exploded,"" I immediately thought of the word ""Skinner""?"
Seymour Skinner,I-I-I-I-I...
Engineer,"Congratulations, gentlemen. Your custodian struck oil. You're standing on top of the richest elementary school in the state."
Engineer,We also found this.
Seymour Skinner,"Thank you, Superdude."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Bah! A non-profit organization with oil? I won't allow it! An oil well doesn't belong in the hands of Betsy Bleedingheart and Maynard G. Muskie-vote!
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, have you had enough exercise for this morning?"
C. Montgomery Burns,No. Let's do another twenty miles.
Waylon Smithers,Ugh!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello... Eh... do..er... uh... Oooh...umm...
Lenny Leonard,"Don't take it so hard, Homer. He's always screwin' up people's names."
Guillermo,"Yeah. At the picnic, he thought my son Reynaldo was my son Rolando. Can you believe that?"
,
Seymour Skinner,"Superintendent, we made the front page today!"
Gary Chalmers,"Uh, what's that say under your hand there?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hm, it's an unrelated article."
Gary Chalmers,It's an unrelated article. Within the banner headline?
Seymour Skinner,"Yes. Now, to re-direct our conversation slightly, I had a few ideas on how to spend this oil money."
Gary Chalmers,"Well, we could give each student a full college scholarship."
Gary Chalmers,
Seymour Skinner,"Oh mercy. Seriously though, before we draw up the budget, I believe the students and faculty have a few suggestions..."
Groundskeeper Willie,"I want a crystal bucket for my slop-water. Oh, and a brand new filthy blanket."
Lunchlady Doris,The cafeteria staff is complaining about the mice in the kitchen. I want to hire a new staff.
Lisa Simpson,I'd like to start a jazz program for the music department. We've got a really great instructor lined up...
Gary Chalmers,Tito Puente!
Lisa Simpson,He's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
Tito Puente,"Man, it will be my pleasure. Lisa has told me all your students are as bright and dedicated to jazz as she is."
Lisa Simpson,"Let's go now, Mr. Puente."
Ralph Wiggum,Chocolate microscopes...?
Otto Mann,You know those guitars that are like double guitars... you know?
Seymour Skinner,More rubber stamps.
Voice,"Principal Skinner, this is your secretary. There is one last student here to see you."
Seymour Skinner,"That's odd. I don't have a secretary, or an intercom. But send him in."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahoy there, Dean! I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh? Well, me and my Fourth Form chums think it would be quite ""corking"" if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern!"
Seymour Skinner,Mr. Burns...
C. Montgomery Burns,Bheh!
Seymour Skinner,It was naive of you to think I would mistake this town's most prominent 104 year-old man for one of my elementary school students.
Moe Szyslak,"Hey! If you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I'm gonna have to charge ya."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I want that oil well! I've got a monopoly to maintain! I own the Electric Company and the Waterworks, plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue."
Seymour Skinner,"That hotel's a dump, and your monopoly is pathetic. The school's oil well is not for sale. Particularly to a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I see. Then I'll just have to... AT-TTACK YOU!
C. Montgomery Burns,"I must have that oil! Oogh! Smithers! Smithers, help me subdue this beast!"
Waylon Smithers,"Sorry, sir, this is all I could find! Take that! And that!"
Seymour Skinner,Please don't waste those.
,
Marge Simpson,I'm happy for the school. It sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
Bart Simpson,"Big deal. They didn't approve my idea. They said it was ""unfeasible."""
Lisa Simpson,"It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart. And even if the Three Stooges were alive, I doubt they'd want to hang around with you."
Bart Simpson,"Well, um, yeah. I guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?"
Homer Simpson,"I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
Marge Simpson,I have an idea.
Homer Simpson,What? What's your idea?
Marge Simpson,"When my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. After that, she never forgot him."
Homer Simpson,"That's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now Marge?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,That's it. Frimble about with your widgets and doobobs. It'll all be a monument to futility when my plan comes to fruition.
Waylon Smithers,"Sir... uh, What I'm about to say violates every sycophantic urge in my body, but: I wish you would reconsider. This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school. People won't stand for it."
C. Montgomery Burns,Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Say, that sounds like a larf. Let's try it right now."
Krusty the Clown,Hey hey.
Waylon Smithers,"Ah, ub, there's some candy right here, Sir. Why don't we eat this instead of stealing?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, very well."
Waylon Smithers,
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, look, there's a photo in here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, yes. I believe that's little Maggie Simpson -- the baby who found my precious teddy-bear Bobo. Oh and there's that, ah Simpson mutt, my former guard dog."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh uh, uh, that's B-Bart Simpson. He was my heir for a brief period, you know."
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, Sir, I remember."
C. Montgomery Burns,Anything left?
Waylon Smithers,"Only the sour quince log, Sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Dispose of it. And uh, send a thank-you note to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Today, Springfield Elementary embarks on a new era: an era of unbridled spending where petro-dollars will fuel our wildest educational fantasies. These young minds will enjoy every academic advantage... ...until they enter Springfield High School, which has no oil well."
High School Student,We got an air hockey table!
Seymour Skinner,"Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump for the very first time, here's our top student, Lisa Simpson."
Nelson Muntz,Nerd!
Engineer,There's no pressure! Someone else has tapped this well!
Tito Puente,Ay carumba!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah. Soon that mighty apparatus will burst forth with its precious fluid. Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,Eh.
Roughneck,Oil ho!!
C. Montgomery Burns,Huzzah!
,
Bart Simpson,Huh? Wahw!
,
,
Santa's Little Helper,
Bart Simpson,
,
Maggie Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Holy Christmas.
,
Veterinarian,"Your dog's condition has been upgraded from ""stable"" to ""frisky,"" and he's free to go. His legs should be good as new in a few months. But in the meantime, he'll have to use the Wheelabout."
Santa's Little Helper,
Bart Simpson,"I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. I swear it."
Veterinarian,"Oops, almost forgot. Wouldn't want you gnawing on those casts, eh boy?"
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Nelson's Parrot,Haw haw!
,
Seymour Skinner,I'm afraid we've got no legal recourse against Mr. Burns and his slant- drilling operation. The oil belongs to whoever pumped it first.
Groundskeeper Willie,What about all the expensive stuff we wanted? Can we still have it?
Seymour Skinner,No.
All Teachers,
Seymour Skinner,"In fact, to pay for the construction, and operation, and demolition of our new derrick, the school will have to eliminate all non-essential programs: music..."
Tito Puente,What?! / Que?!
Seymour Skinner,And maintenance.
Groundskeeper Willie,I'll kill that Mr. Burns!! And wound that Mr. Smithers. Outta my way!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no. that's awful, Mr. Puente. What? Oh. He owns the nuclear power plant. Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash, too."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, how can you work for a man like Mr. Burns?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, he's not all bad. He did send me this nice thank-you card."
Lisa Simpson,"""Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie."" Dad, this doesn't have your name on it."
Homer Simpson,"Kids, would you step outside for a second?"
Homer Simpson,F-F-F-F-F-F-
,
Ned Flanders,Dear Lord. That's the loudest profanity I've ever heard.
,
Barney Gumble,"These fumes aren't as fun as beer. Sure, I'm all dizzy and nauseous, but where's the inflated sense of self-esteem?"
Larry,
Male Inspector,Man alive! There are men alive in here!
Female Inspector,I'm detecting over twenty different toxins in the air.
Barney Gumble,
Male Inspector,"All right, everybody out! As long as Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed."
Moe Szyslak,Damn Burns... Lemme just get one thing.
Barney Gumble,Me too.
Barney Gumble,"Ahhhh, now there's the inflated sense of self-esteem."
,
,
Grampa Simpson,Earthquake!
Grampa Simpson,Nurse!
Other Old People,Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!
,
Waylon Smithers,"Well, Sir, you've certainly vanquished all your enemies: the elementary school, the local tavern, the old age home. You must be very proud."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, not while my greatest nemesis still provides our customers with free light, heat, and energy. I call this enemy... the sun!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Since the beginning of time man has yearned to destroy the sun. I will do the next best thing -- block it out.
Waylon Smithers,Good God!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Imagine it, Smithers. Electrical lights and heaters running all day long."
,
Waylon Smithers,-II don't want any part of this project. It's unconscionably... fiendish.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I will not suffer your insubordination! There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying, Waylon, and you will fall into line. Now."
Waylon Smithers,"No... No, Monty, I won't. Not until you step back from the brink of insanity."
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll do no such thing! You're fired!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Take that, bowl-a-rama! Take that, convenience mart! Take that, nuclear power pla-- Oh, fiddlesticks."
,
Marge Simpson,"I must say Mr. Burns is being awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even."
Patty Bouvier,Mr. Burns has been shot!
Bart Simpson,"Burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo. Right, Dad? Dad? Homer?"
Grampa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Sorry, Grampa. It's just that, for a second, it looked like Dad had melted."
Grampa Simpson,"Well, get used to it, cause I'm livin' here now. I ain't goin' back to the retirement home until they fish my bed outta that sinkhole."
Marge Simpson,Strained carrots for Maggie... Strained carrots for Grampa.
Grampa Simpson,"I want a bib, too."
,
Imaginary Burns #1,"Smithers, who is that ignoramus?"
Imaginary Burns #2,"Smithers, who is that lollygagger?"
Imaginary Burns #3,Who is that blubberpot?
Ten Imaginary Burnses,Who is that bafflewit? / ...lummox? / Puddinghead? / Mooncalf? / Limpnoodle? / Goldbricker? Drizzlepuss? / Cueball? / Fumblefist? / Galoot?
Homer Simpson,"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it!"
Ten Imaginary Burnses,Look out!
Homer Simpson,What?
Elderly Guard,Just a minute.
,
,
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Who the devil are you?!
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns,"What? What are you talking about? Clearly make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. You're just babbling incoherently like some sort of..."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!"
,
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, the lamps runnin' away."
Bart Simpson,"That's my dog, man."
Grampa Simpson,"So long, lamp. Now stop loafing, and help your Grampa unpack."
Bart Simpson,Wow!
Grampa Simpson,"That's my old Smith & Wesson. If you're gonna play with it, be careful, 'cause it's loaded."
Marge Simpson,"Bart! Put that down! Guns are very dangerous, and I won't have them in this house."
Grampa Simpson,How can ya have a house without a gun? What if a bear came through the door?
Marge Simpson,I'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it.
Grampa Simpson,Echt! You shoulda fired into the air! She woulda run off!
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"People! Take it easy! We're all upset about Mr. Burns' plan to uh block out our sun. It is time for decisive action! I have here a polite but firm letter to Mr. Burns' underlings who, with some cajoling, will pass it along to him, or at least give him the gist of it."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Also, it has been brought to my attention that a number of you are stroking guns. Therefore, I will step aside and open up the floor."
Waylon Smithers,"Mr. Burns was the closest thing I ever had to a friend. But he fired me, and now I spend my days drinking cheap scotch and watching Comedy Central."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Oh! Dear God!
Waylon Smithers,"Aw. It's not that bad. I mean, I never miss ""Pardon My Zinger."""
Groundskeeper Willie,Burns cost me my groundskeepin' job at the school! And I'm too superstitious to take the one at the cemetery.
Grampa Simpson,"A-causa him, I lost my room, my things, and my buddy's collection of old sunbathing magazines!"
Old Jewish Man,You bastid!
Moe Szyslak,I lost my bar!
Barney Gumble,I lost his bar!
Lisa Simpson,He robbed the school of music!
Seymour Skinner,He robbed the school of financial security!
Tito Puente,He robbed the school of Tito!
Homer Simpson,He can't remember my name!
Marge Simpson,He's causing us all to yell!
Maggie Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Look what he did to my best friend!
Milhouse Van Houten,Whug?
Bart Simpson,"No, my dog!"
C. Montgomery Burns,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, those wheels are squeaking a bit. Perhaps I could sell him a little oil."
Santa's Little Helper,
Bart Simpson,You twisted old monster!!
C. Montgomery Burns,Nuh-uh-uh.
C. Montgomery Burns,Won't... dignify that... with response.
C. Montgomery Burns,I've decided to protect myself... Ever since I was attacked in my office by an unidentified assailant.
Homer Simpson,
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arr! Burns, yer scurvy schemes will earn ye a one-way passage to the boneyard!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel."
Sideshow Mel,I'll see to it that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal machinations of Hell's grim tyrant!
Otto Mann,Yeah!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, you all talk big, but who here has the guts to stop me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Mmm hmm. Very well. One last question: Have you ever seen the sun set at 3:00 PM?
Captain Horatio McCallister,Aye! Once when I was sailing 'round the Arctic Cir...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Shut up, you! Take one last look at the sun, Springfield."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, hey! I've been in Reno for six weeks. Did I miss anything? What the.."
,
Lunchlady Doris,"Eternal darkness. Well, that's just great."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Listen, someone's got to get that Mr. Burns. Uh, where's a gun-toting low-life when you need one?"
Snake Jailbird,"Sorry, I was in the can."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahhh. Perpetual twilight bathed in the glow of Burns brand electricity!
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello lamp post/ Whatcha knowin'? / I've come to watch your power flowing.
,
Carl Carlson,That's odd. Mr. Smithers left his jacket behind.
Otto Mann,Whoa. That's odd. Principal Skinner left his mother behind.
Marge Simpson,That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart? And Lisa? And Grampa?
C. Montgomery Burns,"After all these years, things are finally starting to go my way. I feel like celebrating. I..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about? I see. Well, I think you'd better drop it. I said drop it! Get your -- get your hands off--"
,
Marge Simpson,Where is everybody?
Marge Simpson,
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, man, are you okay?"
Chief Wiggum,Just a minute! This isn't Mr. Burns at all! It's a mask!
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, wait. It is Burns. His wrinkly skin looks... looks like a mask."
Marge Simpson,I don't think we'll ever know who did this. Everyone in town's a suspect.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, I couldn't possibly solve this mystery. Can you?"
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, I'll give it a shot. I mean, you know, it's my job, right?"
,
Waylon Smithers,Ugh. My mouth tastes like an ashtray.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, wait your turn. There's plenty of hot water for all."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, you weren't shot? It was all a dream."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right. The year is 1965, and you and I are undercover detectives on the hot-rod circuit. Now let's burn rubber, baby!"
Announcer,Speedway Squad! In color.
Waylon Smithers,"Wait, that was all a dream. Hey, then maybe I haven't become a hideous, drunken wreck!"
Waylon Smithers,Oh.
Kent Brockman,"Dozens of people are gunned down each day in Springfield, but until now, none of them was important. I'm Kent Brockman. At 3 p.m. Friday, local autocrat C. Montgomery Burns was shot following a tense confrontation at Town Hall."
Kent Brockman,"Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was then transferred to a better hospital, where doctors upgraded his condition to ""alive."""
Kent Brockman,"Now, let's talk to Police Chief Wiggum."
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, hiya, Kent. Ah, right now we are questioning two witnesses who were in the vicinity at the time."
,
Lou,Didja see this guy? Was he anywhere near the parking lot when Burns got shot?
Maggie Simpson,
Eddie,"Aw, it's no use. They ain't talkin'."
,
Lisa Simpson,Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns. Even us.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, he broke your dog's legs. Grampa, he destroyed your home. And Dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name."
Homer Simpson,"Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?"
Bart Simpson,"Aren't we forgetting someone, Sister Suspect?"
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, I was just getting to me. Because of Mr. Burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend Tito Puente got fired. But I could never shoot someone."
Bart Simpson,Could so!
Lisa Simpson,Could not!
Bart Simpson,Could so!
Lisa Simpson,Could not!
Bart Simpson,Could so!
Lisa Simpson,Could not!
Bart Simpson,Could so!
Lisa Simpson,Could not!
Homer Simpson,"Kids! Kids! Kids! As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers."
Marge Simpson,The police already have a suspect. It's Mr. Smithers.
Grampa Simpson,"Sure, Smithers! / He's a good suspect! / Oh, I bet he's the one! / Definitely Smithers!"
Grampa Simpson,"Yeah! Smingers did it! Case closed. Now, where's my hat? I'm going to the outhouse."
Lisa Simpson,We don't have an outhouse.
Homer Simpson,My tool shed! Oh Dad!
,
Waylon Smithers,"Could I have shot Mr. Burns in a drunken rage? No. No, not me. I know in my heart I..."
Smithers's Brain,"My gun! And it's been recently fired! Wait, I remember leaving the town meeting..."
Waylon Smithers,"I must've run into Mr. Burns outside, and..."
Waylon Smithers,
Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns! What have I done?!
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns' sun blockin' machine. You wanna come with?"
Homer Simpson,Sure! I've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Pull, Duchess, pull!"
Krusty the Clown,"Um... Uh, what town did we just crush?"
Seymour Skinner,Shelbyville.
Townspeople,Yay!!
,
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, this guilt is driving me mad. I've got to tell someone."
Waylon Smithers,"Father, I'm not a Catholic, but... well, I tried to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade... Anyway, I've got a... rather large sin to confess. I'm the one who... who shot Mr. Burns."
Chief Wiggum,"That's all I needed to hear. Boy, this thing works great."
,
Waylon Smithers,The man became consumed by greed. He'd steal from anyone.
Waylon Smithers,This isn't a rival company you're battling with. It's a school. People won't stand for it.
C. Montgomery Burns,Pish-posh. It will be like taking candy from a baby.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Say, that sounds like a larf."
Waylon Smithers,"And when he tried to steal our sunlight, he crossed that line between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy."
SUPER-VILLAIN,Bah! He was a rank amateur compared to Dr. Colossus!
SUPER-VILLAIN,Ow. When is my lawyer coming?
Reporters,"Mr. Smithers! / Smithers! / Over here, Waylon! /"
Dave Shutton,"Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily Shopper. Who are you? Where are you going?"
Kent Brockman,"Oh, do your research, Shutton! Ah, Kent Brockman, Channel Six News. How does it feel to be accused of the attempted murder of your boss and mentor?"
Waylon Smithers,"Kent, I, I feel about as low as Madonna when she found out she missed Tailhook."
Reporters,
Kent Brockman,"I'm going to say ""ouch!"" for Madonna."
,
Krusty the Clown,Hey! That's my Madonna gag! That guy stole my gag!
Sideshow Mel,"And you stole it from last Friday's episode of ""Pardon My Zinger."""
Krusty the Clown,"Stole, made-up, what's the difference?"
Sideshow Mel,"Mr. Smithers must have seen that program, too. He never misses it. Hm."
Sideshow Mel,"At the town meeting, he mentioned that he watched Comedy Central. I made sure to note that, as it seemed quite unusual. Ye Gods. To the police station, Krusty!"
,
Sideshow Mel,"I am Melvin Van Horne, and this is my associate Herschel Krustofsky."
Sideshow Mel,"Officer, you have arrested an innocent man!"
Chief Wiggum,"Really? Aw, jeez."
Chief Wiggum,"All right, Colossus, you're free to go. But stay away from Death Mountain."
SUPER-VILLAIN,All my stuff is there.
Sideshow Mel,"I was referring to Waylon Smithers. Mr. Burns was shot Friday at 3:00 p.m. -- the very time that Smithers was at home watching ""Pardon My Zinger."" So you see, he couldn't have done it."
Waylon Smithers,Yes! You're right! I remember now! I - I watched that entire show! In fact...
Waylon Smithers,I left the town meeting early so I could get home in time.
Waylon Smithers,"Agh. I've gotta run, or I'll miss the opening rank-out."
Waylon Smithers,
Jasper Beardly,"Slow down! The sidewalk's fer reg'lar walkin', not fer fancy-walkin'."
Waylon Smithers,Out of my way. I'm in a hurry.
Jasper Beardly,"You simmer down, I'll letcha go."
Waylon Smithers,"So... Instead of wounding an evil old man, I may have killed an innocent old man. That's much worse."
Krusty the Clown,"About fifty-thousand volts worse, if you know what I mean. Eeeeh! Bzzzt! Sizzle..."
Chief Wiggum,"Wait a minute. If a second old geezer got shot, how come nobody reported it?"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, hi. Um, can we take a look at your leg?"
Jasper Beardly,"Yeah, that's real spruce. You like it?"
Waylon Smithers,"Phew. Thank God. Sir, I, I only hope you can forgive me for shooting your wooden leg."
Jasper Beardly,You shot who in the what now?
Chief Wiggum,"Okay, Smithers, you're free to go. And you, one question: do you know who shot Mr. Burns, cause we are really up the creek on this one. ."
,
Kent Brockman,"And with the prime suspect cleared and found completely innocent, we must now ask ourselves: ""Who could possibly be as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers?"""
Marge Simpson,I guess it's never the most likely suspect.
Lisa Simpson,Look at Burns' suit. Yeesh.
Lisa Simpson,"Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is. The rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I had a damn good reason. He could never remember my name..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Who the devil are you?
Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns,
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder."
Grampa Simpson,"Eh, you never know what you're capable of. I never thought I could shoot down a German plane -- but last year, I proved myself wrong."
Lisa Simpson,Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. And I've got an inquisitive temperament! Maybe I could help solve this!
Marge Simpson,I think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?
Bart Simpson,Who wants chocolate ice cream?
Homer Simpson,"Me! Me! Me, me!"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Okay boys, we've got a clue - the bullet they took out of Burns. Now, let's discuss the, um..."
Chief Wiggum,Motive.
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Burns is the richest man in town. Maybe it was about money.
Chief Wiggum,"That's some good thinking, Lou."
Lou,"Thanks, Chief."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey! I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson, and I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case. Look."
,
Eddie,That's a real good way to get sick.
,
Eddie,"I had an idea, Chief. Why don't we check out that suit Burns was wearing when he got shot?"
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, what about that jazz teacher that got laid off? You know, um, Mister Samba? SeÃ±or Mambo? What was it?"
Lisa Simpson,Tito Puente?
Chief Wiggum,Yeah.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, he did vow revenge. But I can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! He's a celebrit--"
Chief Wiggum,"Let's roll, boys."
,
,
Tito Puente,"Revenge? Of course. But why wound his body with bullets when I can set his soul afire with a slanderous mambo? Listen, if you will, to my revenge. Uno, dos, tres..."
Crooner,WOUNDS WON'T LAST LONG / BUT AN INSULTING SONG / BURNS WILL ALWAYS CARRY WITH HIM. / SO I'LL SETTLE MY SCORE / ON THE SALSA FLOOR / WITH THIS VENGEFUL LATIN RHYTHM! / BU-URNS! CON EL CORAZON DE PERRO! / SENOR BU-URNS! EL DIABLO CON DINERO!
Crooner,"THIS MAY NOT SURPRISE YOU / BUT ALL OF US DESPISE YOU / PLEASE DIE / AND FRY / IN HELL / YOU ROTTEN, RICH, OLD WRETCH! ADIOS, VIEJO!"
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah! Okay, okay, I believe you're innocent. Gee, I hope all the suspects are this much fun."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Hum-m-m. Now-now let, let... me... let me think."
Chief Wiggum,
Seymour Skinner,"Now, I did - I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr. Burns. When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup..."
Seymour Skinner,Blast! I took mother's makeup kit by mistake.
Gary Chalmers,"Oh, uh, excuse me, ma'am."
Seymour Skinner,Superintendent Chalmers!
,
Chief Wiggum,So Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts?
Seymour Skinner,"Oh yes. But, anything else he tells you is a filthy lie."
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"I'm tellin' ya, I could nay have shot Burns!"
Eddie,This is your last warning about that.
Chief Wiggum,Did you have that same backwards-talking dream with the flamin' cards?
Eddie,I'll drive.
Groundskeeper Willie,"It's impossible for me to fire a pistol. If you'll check me medical records, you'll see I have a cripplin' arthritis in me index fingers! Look at 'em!"
Groundskeeper Willie,I got it from Space Invaders in 1977.
Chief Wiggum,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game."
Groundskeeper Willie,Video game?
Eddie,Did you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns?
Moe Szyslak,No.
Moe Szyslak,"All right, maybe I did. But I didn't shoot him."
Eddie,"Checks out. Okay, Sir, you're free to go."
Moe Szyslak,"Good, cause I got a hot date tonight. A date. Dinner with friends. Dinner alone. Watching TV alone. All right. I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies in the Victoria's Secret catalog. Sears catalog."
Moe Szyslak,"Now wouldja unhook this, already please?! I don't deserve this kind of shabby treatment!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. Have you seen it?"
Grampa Simpson,You accuse me of everything around here. Who put slippers in the dishwasher? Who threw a cane at the TV? Who fell into the china hutch?
Marge Simpson,I was just asking if you'd seen it. There's no need to be a prickly pear.
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby. I missed you bad."
Marge Simpson,"Were you talking to me, Grampa?"
Grampa Simpson,Um... yes?
Marge Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,"We're still not close. Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain buster. Better drink some coffee."
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, we're out of coffee. Oh well, I'll just drink this warm cream."
Lisa Simpson,Chief Wig-gum... Don't eat... the clues.
Lisa Simpson,This suit burns better. Look.
Chief Wiggum,Huh?
Lisa Simpson,Better... look... burns... suit.
Chief Wiggum,I'm not following you.
Lisa Simpson,Burns' suit! Burns' suit!
Chief Wiggum,Huh?
,
Chief Wiggum,Eureka!
Technician,"Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours?"
Chief Wiggum,No. We need to find out who it belonged to. We want a D.N.A. test.
Technician,"Ooh, ooh, ee, ooh, ooh... That takes eight to ten weeks."
Technician,Did I say weeks? 'Cause I meant seconds.
Chief Wiggum,Whaddya got the whole town's D.N.A. on file?
Technician,"Yuh-huh. If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got yer D.N.A. Whyddya think they keep 'em in circulation?"
Technician,Scan's finished. Now it's gonna narrow it down to the family bloodline.
C. Montgomery Burns,Homer Simpson!
Eddie,Bingo. The gunman has a name-o.
Lou,Chief! Chief! Chief!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? What's going on?"
Chief Wiggum,"I'm sorry, kid. We got Simpson D.N.A. on Burn's clothing and your father was identified by the old man himself."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"D.N.A., positive I.D. -- Those won't hold up in any court -- Run, Dad!"
Lou,Hey-ho. Look what I found under Mr. Simpson's car seat.
Homer Simpson,"I swear, I've never seen that gun before."
Eddie,"Then why are your fingerprints all over it, sir?"
Homer Simpson,
Chief Wiggum,"This bullet matches the one we took out of Burns. Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted murder."
Homer Simpson,
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, that's what they all say. ...They all say, ""D'oh."""
,
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah we need two cups of coffee, and two orders of Bite-Size Breakfast Pancakes. With extra dipping sauce."
Teenage Employee,"Please pull up to the service window, please."
Chief Wiggum,"The wagon's too tall. Aw, I don't wanna have to get out. Ah, I'll just drive up on the curb."
Chief Wiggum,Ergh... Blugh... Almost got it...
Lou,"Drop the food, Chief!!"
Chief Wiggum,Noooooo!
Jasper Beardly,Dang fools. Drive-thru's not fer a-parkin'.
Teenage Employee,"Dianne, I'm going to take my break now."
,
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hi, everybody!"
,
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Okay, that was a little strange. Um tell me, how are you feeling today?"
,
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hmm... That seems to be all you can say. When you were in that coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged?"
,
Marge Simpson,"The police have such a strong case against Homer. Mr. Burns said he did it, they have Homer's D.N.A..."
Lisa Simpson,"They have Simpson D.N.A. It could've come from any of us. Except you, since you're a Bouvier."
Marge Simpson,"No. No, no. When I took your father's name, I took everything that came with it, including D.N.A."
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, Mom. Anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. Like those fingerprints. They could've gotten on the gun some other way."
Lisa Simpson,Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right. You chose fruit, you live with fruit."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the floor?
Lisa Simpson,And we don't even know whose gun that was. Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.
Marge Simpson,No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members. Suspicion could tear us apart.
Grampa Simpson,That's right. We all gotta stick together if we're gonna have any hope of bringing that awful Homer to justice.
,
Chief Wiggum,Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.
,
Waylon Smithers,"Thank you. As Montgomery Burns' closest friend, I am certain that there is nothing he would want more than swift, brutal revenge against Homer Simpson. Therefore, I am offering a $50,000 reward for his capture. Dead or alive."
Crowd,
Chief Wiggum,Me first! Me first!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson,"So you finally learned my name, eh?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson,I've got no time for your demented parlor games! You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.
,
Lisa Simpson,The scene of the crime! There must be something here that can clear Dad.
Pigeon,"Clue, clue."
Lisa Simpson,"That's it! Oh, Mr. Pigeon, I'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease."
Lisa Simpson,"So, the D.N.A. was right. It must've been... Oh, Dad!"
Police Dispatcher,Attention all units. Homer Simpson has been sighted. Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital.
Lisa Simpson,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Be careful when we capture him! We cannot claim the reward unless we have fifty-one per cent of the carcass.
,
Lisa Simpson,Stop! Don't shoot my Dad! He's innocent. He wouldn't hurt a fly!
C. Montgomery Burns,Ho-mer Simp... son. Ho... mersimp... son.
Homer Simpson,Stop telling them it was me. I'll kill you for saying it was me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mersimp... Son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?"
Homer Simpson,Say it Burns. Say I never shot you... Before.
C. Montgomery Burns,Shot? By you? I'm afraid not my primitive friend. Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm. The one who shot me was...
C. Montgomery Burns,Ma.. Maggie Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns,"With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world..."
C. Montgomery Burns,So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
C. Montgomery Burns,I feel like celebrating.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I see.
Director,"Look, we just want to make movies. Not kill things."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes... that's the one. Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
C. Montgomery Burns,I think you'd better drop it!
C. Montgomery Burns,But the old exhume was misleading. Taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult.
C. Montgomery Burns,I said drop it!
C. Montgomery Burns,Stricken I lurched forth in search of aide.
C. Montgomery Burns,"But finding only slacked jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
Lisa Simpson,Then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to W and S.
Lisa Simpson,"Or from your point of view, M and S... Maggie Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,What? No! With my last ounce of strength I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them. Those paramedics have sticky fingers.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. If Maggie could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I' afraid that's insufficient. Officer, arrest the baby."
Chief Wiggum,Yeah right pops. No jury in the world is gonna convict a baby. Mmm... except maybe Texas.
Marge Simpson,"Besides, she didn't mean it. It was an accident."
,
Bart Simpson,"Aw, all these new superheroes suck. None of them can hold a candle to Radioactive Man."
Milhouse Van Houten,The only decent new one is Radiation Dude.
Bart Simpson,"Nah, he's just a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man."
Milhouse Van Houten,Explain.
Bart Simpson,"The similarities are subtle, but many. For example, Radioactive Man has his famous catchphrase ""Up and Atom"" - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun..."
Milhouse Van Houten,Go on.
Bart Simpson,"... while Radiation Dude has a similar, but lamer catchphrase: ""Up and Let's Go."""
Comic Book Guy,"So, you kids fancy yourselves experts, eh?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, between us we've read all 814 issues of Radioactive Man."
Moe Szyslak,Yeah.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, and we both have the special limited edition issue where he and Fallout Boy get killed on every page."
Comic Book Guy,"Well, I suppose you know then that Hollywood is planning a feature film about ""Radioactive Man."""
Comic Book Guy,I have got to do something about that air conditioner suction.
Bart Simpson,Who's gonna play Radioactive Man?
Comic Book Guy,I will tell you in exactly seven minutes.
,
Comic Book Guy,"Okay, here we are..."
Comic Book Guy,"Alt-dot-nerd-dot-obsessive. ""Need know star RM pic."""
,
,
Old Board Member,I don't see why Rainier Wolfcastle should be the star. I think we should bring back Dirk Richter. Kids will wanna see the original Radioactive Man.
Producer,I keep telling you. He's 73 years old and he's DEAD.
Old Board Member,"Granted, but..."
Director,"Besides, we want to stay as far away from the campy 70s version as possible."
Fallout Boy,"Billowing backpacks, Radioactive Man! It's the worst villain of them all: The Scoutmaster!"
Radioactive Man,"I see him, Fallout Boy."
Scoutmaster,"Go get 'em, scouts!"
Scoutmaster,"Don't be afraid to use your nails, boys!"
Producer,"So, where could we shoot this picture? We need a city that has a nuclear reactor and a gorge, and can guarantee us the full cooperation of city officials."
Assistant,"I'll check ""Variety."""
Producer,Wow! Look at that ad!
Producer,All right. This place must be hot. They don't need a big ad or even correct spelling.
Old Board Member,I agree with that logic.
Producer,Get me two plane tickets to the state that Springfield is in.
,
Producer,All right. We have 30 million dollars to spend.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"We'll blow up our dams, destroy forests, anything. If there's a species of animal that's causing problems - nosing around your camera-- we'll have it wiped out."
,
,
Seymour Skinner,"Students, I have an announcement. One of your favorite comic book heroes, Radio Man..."
Nelson Muntz,"Radioactive Man, stupid."
Seymour Skinner,"Strange. I shouldn't have been able to hear that. Anyway, a Hollywood studio has decided to film the Radioactive Man movie here in Springfield."
Kids,Yayyyyyy!
Seymour Skinner,And they will be holding auditions to find a local youngster to play Fallout Boy.
Kids,
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, and the air conditioner will be fixed this afternoon."
,
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Look behind you, Radioactive Man! The sun is exploding again!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart, why are you talking like that?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?"
Bart Simpson,"I'm practicing my Fallout Boy dialogue. If I get this role, I could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called Bart."
Different Announcers,Eve - er - y - one - is - talk - king - a - bout - Ra - di - o - ac - tive - Ma - an - y'all.
,
Barney Gumble,Wow! You mean you were one of the original Little Rascals?
Moe Szyslak,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,Which one were you? The ugly one?
Homer Simpson,Were you the ugly one?
Moe Szyslak,"No. I was the tough kid. Smelly. My shtick was looking into an exhaust pipe and gettin' a faceful of soot. Heh, nobody could do that better than me. Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time, but you know, we had good writers. William Faulkner could write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think."
Barney Gumble,"If you were such a big shot, why aren't you still making movies?"
Barney Gumble,Moe?... Moe?
Moe Szyslak,Oh no! My favorite aggie!
Moe Szyslak,"You stole my bit! You... That's my bit ya... Ya... ooh, ooh, you stole my bit!"
Director,Cut!
Stagehand,Oh my God! He's killed the original Alfalfa!
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Luckily, Alfalfa was an orphan owned by the studio."
All,"Oh, I see / Yeah / That makes sense."
Kent Brockman,"With wealthy Hollywood people on the way, local merchants can be forgiven for raising their prices a little."
,
All Kids,"Watch out, Radioactive Man."
Bart Simpson,Watch out!
Bart Simpson,...Radioactive Man!!!
Kids,Whoa... Aah...
Nelson Muntz,Totally awesome.
Bart Simpson,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's all in the delivery. ...Now is the winter of our discontent..."
Ralph Wiggum,Oh no! Run!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Mom, don't make me do this. I don't wanna be an actor."
Luann Van Houten,Nonsense. You're going to be great. Now take off those glasses so they can see your beautiful eyes.
,
Lunchlady Doris,"At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy?"
Nelson Muntz,Watch ou...
Director,Next.
Nelson Muntz,"Haw, haw. Hey, that hurts. No wonder no one came to my birthday party. If I didn't laugh, I'd cry."
Lunchlady Doris,"At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy?"
Ralph Wiggum,What's for lunch tomorrow?
Director,Next.
Ralph Wiggum,Chicken necks?
Director,We're never going to find... wait a minute.
Director,That child has the exact qualities we're looking for. He's perfect. What is his name?
Casting Lady,I don't know. He just came along with one of the others. He didn't sign up officially.
Director,"Oh, forget him, then. It wouldn't be fair to the other children who filled out their application forms in full."
Director,Next!
Lunchlady Doris,"At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy?"
Bart Simpson,"Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!"
Director,Brilliant reading. Again!
Bart Simpson,"Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!"
Director,Fantastic! One more time.
Bart Simpson,"Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!"
Director,"Congratulations, Bart Simpson, you're our new Fallout Boy."
Bart Simpson,
Director,That's what I'd be saying to you if you weren't an inch too short. Next.
,
Bart Simpson,"I've got to grow an inch by tomorrow or I won't get that part. Pull, you mighty stallions, pull. Show me no mercy."
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,I only grew half an inch. I'm still too short.
Marge Simpson,"Growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, Bart."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, that's how fast Grampa is shrinking."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, I'm as tall as I ever was."
Bart Simpson,Is there anyway I can look taller without actually being taller?
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Good news, gentlemen. I've grown that extra inch you wanted, plus several feet more."
Director,We've found our new Fallout Boy!
Bart Simpson,
Director,And he's right over there!
Milhouse Van Houten,Huh?
,
Director,"Ladies and gentlemen, meet America's new Fallout Boy!"
Lionel Hutz,"Outta the way, boy. Milhouse, baby! Lionel Hutz, your new agent, bodyguard, unauthorized biographer, and drug dealer. Uh, keeper awayer."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Leave me alone! Mom! Dad! Make 'em stop!
,
Milhouse Van Houten,What is all this stuff?
Kirk Van Houten,We heard you've become a star. We decided we'd better start living in the fast lane.
Milhouse Van Houten,What if I'm not a success? How will you pay for all this?
Luann Van Houten,"I'm sorry, I can't hear you son. I'm wearing a Jacuzzi suit."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, you're not Milhouse."
Bully Girls,Keep away! etc.
Bart Simpson,I just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life. George Burns was right -- show business is a hideous bitch goddess.
Lisa Simpson,"Cheer up, Bart. Milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. Someone to tell him he's great, someone to rub lotion on him, someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low."
Bart Simpson,"You're right, Lis. I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God."
Homer Simpson,"Guess what, kids. They're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here."
Teamster,We'll run that cable through here.
Homer Simpson,Careful now.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, didn't you direct ""Unnatural Discretion""?"
Director,"Heh, yes I did."
Homer Simpson,"Hooey! Whew, oh. You know, I never walk out of a movie, but Eech!"
Producer,"I've got an idea, Mr. Simpson. Why don't you get something to eat from our food truck?"
Producer,Mr. Simpson?
,
Krusty the Clown,You've got to give me the part of Krispy the clown.
Director,"I'm sorry, you're wrong for the part."
Krusty the Clown,But look at my range!
Producer,"I'm sorry. Krispy the Klown has been cast. But I will hire you for Angry the Clown, Silly Sailor and Doctor Clownies."
Krusty the Clown,"I won't let you down. Well, I might let you down on Silly Sailor."
,
Dialogue Coach,Up and Atom.
Rainier Wolfcastle,Up and at them.
Dialogue Coach,Up and ATOM.
Dialogue Coach,Up and ATOM.
Dialogue Coach,Better.
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Milhouse. Hey, I want you to know that I'm glad at least one of us got the part."
Bart Simpson,Milhouse!
Bart Simpson,I didn't do it! I wished him well! I wished him weeelll!
Bart Simpson,
Movie Prop Guy,Stupid dummy wasn't supposed to explode yet.
Bart Simpson,There's the real Milhouse.
Bart Simpson,Milhouse!
Estonian Dwarf,No. I am just Milhouse when he gets hurt.
Director,"Okay, let's get the real Milhouse over here under the X-ray truck."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hi, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, cool, Milhouse! You get to be crushed by a truck!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"It sounds like more fun than it really is. Hey, I, I think I'm lying on a broken bottle."
Director,Beautiful. Use it. Okay. Fallout Boy origin scene. Take one. Action.
Radioactive Man,Up and AT THEM!
Fallout Boy,"Thanks for the help, Mysterious Stranger. Say, I think those x-rays gave me super powers."
Director,And... cut! That was perfect. Let's do it again.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, these aren't real X-rays, are they?"
Director,"Good question. We'll check into that. Okay, X-ray machine to full power and ...Action!"
,
Martin Prince,"Uh, sir, why don't you just use real cows?"
Prop Guy,Cows don't look like cows on film. You gotta use horses.
Ralph Wiggum,What do you do if you want something that looks like a horse?
Prop Guy,"Eh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together."
Homer Simpson,You guys work on the movie?
Teamster,You saying we're not working?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to you?"
Producer,"Oh, here he comes. What is it now, Quimby?"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Nothing. Nothing. only... the uh... city has just passed another tax on uh, puffy directing pants."
Producer,But I don't wear puffy pants.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"I meant, a uh, tax on not wearing puffy pants."
Producer,
Mayor Joe Quimby,I'm sorry.
,
Bart Simpson,"Wow. You really got it made now, Milhouse. This is living."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Is it, Bart? Is it?"
Bart Simpson,Yes.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Ever since I became a movie star, I've been miserable. I had to get up at five A.M. just for makeup."
Otto Mann,Should we give them some of their money back?
Milhouse Van Houten,"I like the way the blush brings out my cheekbones, but it's not worth it. And making movies is so horribly repetitive. I've said ""jiminy jillikers"" so many times the words have lost all meaning."
Director,"We've got to do the ""jiminy jillikers"" scene again, Milhouse."
Milhouse Van Houten,"But we already did it. It took seven hours, but we did it. It's done."
Director,Yes! But we've got to do it from different angles. Again and again and again and again and again.
Milhouse Van Houten,Ahhhhh!
Bart Simpson,Yeah. Ahhh!
,
Radioactive Man,I can't believe Silly Sailor beat us both out and imprisoned us in his floating aqua world.
Fallout Boy,Jiminy jillikers!
Radioactive Man,"Da-dah now, there's no need for profanity, Fallout Boy."
Producer,"Everyone in town has been gouging us silly, but it's worth it. It's all up there on the screen."
Director,"Yes, that Milhouse is going to be big. Gabby Hayes big."
,
Director,"Okay, listen up, everybody. This is the hardest, most expensive scene in the movie and we only get one shot at it so we have to do it right. Fallout Boy will untie Radioactive Man and pull him to safety, moments before he's hit with a forty- foot wall of sulfuric acid that will horribly burn everything in its path. Now, that's real acid. So I want to see goggles, people."
Radioactive Man,Real acid?
Director,"Okay... Roll film... Tip the acid vats... and, action!"
Radioactive Man,Only Fallout Boy can save me now.
Director,Where's Fallout Boy?
Director,Fallout Boy!
Radioactive Man,Uh-oh.
Radioactive Man,My eyes! The goggles do nothing.
Director,Where in the Hell is Milhouse?! That one shot cost us a million dollars.
Krusty the Clown,Where's the producer? I want to talk about this coffee.
,
,
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,No.
Ralph Wiggum,
Editor,"Thanks to modern editing techniques, we can use existing footage to complete the film without Milhouse. Watch."
Radioactive Man,"Looks like we're in trouble, Fallout Boy."
Fallout Boy,"Jiminy Jillikers, Radioactive Man!"
Radioactive Man,We'll have to fight our way out. Are you ready?
Fallout Boy,Yes.
Editor,"Seamless, huh?"
Producer,You're fired.
Editor,And with good cause.
,
Chief Wiggum,Go!
Chief Wiggum,"Okay, we can all stop worrying now. These dogs will never fail."
Kirk Van Houten,"But... uh, will they just find Milhouse? Or will they find him and kill him?"
Chief Wiggum,Well... uh... when they find him they'll um... mumma hammell fusnuhm...
Kirk Van Houten,"Uh, excuse me. You didn't answer me. You just trailed off."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah... yeah, I did kinda trail off there, didn't I?"
,
Bart Simpson,I know Milhouse. I'll just check all his old haunts.
,
Bart Simpson,Have you seen Milhouse?
Comic Book Guy,No. Now go away. We're racing for the title of the Champion of the Universe.
Otto Mann,Awright!
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Yo, Doctor S. Have you seen Milhouse?"
Spirograph Man,No.
Bart Simpson,"Okay, thanks."
Spirograph Man,Wait.
Spirograph Man,Did you know there's a direct correlation between the decline of the Spirograph and the rise in gang activity? Think about it.
Bart Simpson,I will.
Spirograph Man,No you won't.
,
Bart Simpson,The only place left is the treehouse.
,
Bart Simpson,Ah-ha!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Stay away from me, Bart. I mean it, I'm not goin' back. I'm not cut out to be a star."
Bart Simpson,"But Milhouse, being a star is every patriotic American's dream."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Not mine. It's a sham, Bart. You get up on that big screen pretending to be a hero, but you're not. The real heroes are out there, toiling day and night on more important things."
Bart Simpson,Television.
Milhouse Van Houten,No! Curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger.
Bart Simpson,"But Milhouse! They haven't cured anything. Heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. Those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. Every last one of them. Want results? You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes."
Milhouse Van Houten,Mickey Rooney!
Mickey Rooney,"Hi Milhouse. The studio sent me to talk to you, being a former child star myself and the number one box office draw from 1939 through 1940."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, spanning two decades."
Milhouse Van Houten,How'd you find us?
Mickey Rooney,"Uh, they tapped your treehouse phone."
Mickey Rooney,"Milhouse, listen. You can't quit this movie. I've seen your work. It's good, very, very good. Van Johnson good."
Milhouse Van Houten,I know I'm good. Movie stardom is just so hollow.
Mickey Rooney,"Hollow? The only thing in show business that's hollow is the music industry. C'mon, Milhouse, ya have to do this. If not for yourself, then for the movie-going public, and for the foreign markets that are more important than ever nowadays... and finally, for me, the Mickster."
Milhouse Van Houten,No.
Mickey Rooney,"All right, I tried."
Mickey Rooney,Fortunately we have a perfectly good uh Fallout Boy right here.
Mickey Rooney,"Jiminy jillikers, jiminy jillikers, jiminy jillikers!"
Director,We're shutting down production.
Producer,"Yeah well, we only have a thousand dollars left anyway."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Uh, there's, uh, a thousand dollar leaving town tax."
,
Mickey Rooney,"Well, I hope you're all satisfied. You've bankrupted a bunch of naive movie folks. Folks from Hollywood, where values are different. They weren't thinking about the money. They just wanted to tell a story. A story about a radioactive man. And you slick small towners took 'em for all they were worth."
Helicopter Pilot,"Hurry, Mr. Rooney! We've got a disenchanted little girl in a Jell-O pudding commercial."
Mickey Rooney,I can play that.
,
Bart Simpson,"So, Milhouse, it must be a little tough givin' up all that glamour comin' back to school, huh."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Quiet, maybe I can get my citizenship."
,
SHALLOW-LOOKING HOLLYWOODITE,"We know you don't have any money left, but that doesn't matter. Just take whatever you need from our boutiques until you can get back on your feet."
Producer,"Thank God we're back in Hollywood, where people treat each other right."
,
Marge Simpson,"Here's your toast, Maggie. I Melba-fied it myself."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down those old newspapers for your history project."
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, Mom. You didn't have to go to this much trouble."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, it was no trouble. The hobos at the dump were very helpful. Except one man who seemed to have mental problems."
Bart Simpson,G'mornin'.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, it's class photo day. No dracula fangs."
Bart Simpson,But they told us to wear 'em.
Marge Simpson,No they didn't.
Marge Simpson,And don't put signs on your sister.
Marge Simpson,"Now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30. That way, the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry! Eh? Eh?"
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, you fuss over us way too much."
Marge Simpson,"Enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's a spider near my car keys."
Marge Simpson,You did the right thing by telling me.
Marge Simpson,Shoo! Get outta here!
Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, that's better. Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a li'l honey for his Mama Bear."
Marge Simpson,"""Good for a three hour getaway at the Mingled Waters Health Spa."" Mineral bath, facial, massage... How did you afford these?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, never you mind..."
,
Homer Simpson,"What advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? Which I could also afford."
Bentley Salesman,"Well, you'll notice how the heated gas pedal warms your feet while --"
Bentley Salesman,"...gently massages your buttocks. Well, Count Homer, shall we discuss the--"
Homer Simpson,No we shan't. Yoink!
Marge Simpson,"Homie, this is so sweet. But I can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess..."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon."
Marge Simpson,What about Maggie?
Homer Simpson,I got my dad to look after her.
Grampa Simpson,BEHIND YOU!!
Marge Simpson,Don't do that!
Grampa Simpson,Don't do that!
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you."
Marge Simpson,"Well, all right, but I'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car."
Marge Simpson,
,
Edna Krabappel,"Tighten those braids, missie. Hoist your flag, Dooley."
Edna Krabappel,"Nelson, you look adorable."
Nelson Muntz,I feel like punchin' myself.
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, stop scratching. You're messing up your hair."
Edna Krabappel,Lice?! How on earth does a boy get head lice in this day and age?
Milhouse Van Houten,We bought a wicker basket from Pier One and he was passed out inside.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, how come I get lice and nothing happens to Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,S-So cold. So very very cold.
Groundskeeper Willie,"See ya in hell, ye wingless blood-suckers!"
Head Lice,
Seymour Skinner,What kind of parents would permit such a lapse in scalpel hygiene?
Groundskeeper Willie,"Well, ya better check out his sister. She could be rrrife with them boogs, too!"
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, c'mon! Those are prescription shoes! I need them!"
Bully Girls,You have cooties! You have cooties!
Lisa Simpson,No I don't!
Seymour Skinner,"Lisa Simpson, report to the principal's office for head lice inspection."
Bully Girls,/ Cooties! / Lisa's cooties have lice!
Lisa Simpson,Ow! Mah tug!
Voice,Heads up!
Lisa Simpson,"Printhipal Thkinner, I need thum shoes."
Seymour Skinner,Sweet Georgia Brown! Something is rotten at the Simpson house.
,
,
Marge Simpson,"This is so relaxing. Homie, this was a wonderful idea."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel."
Old Mafia Guy,"Don't mind-a me. Look, I do it-a first."
,
Officer Goodman,"Whoa, would you look at this place."
Officer Noble,"Sink full of dirty dishes, trash not taken out, living room a mess. Stacks of old newspapers... From twenty years ago!"
,
TV Announcer,"Get ready, gamblers, for the World Series of Dog Racing!"
Grampa Simpson,
Officer Goodman,A disheveled and malnourished man found sleeping in his own filth. Seems confused and dehydrated.
Officer Noble,Where is the baby?
Grampa Simpson,"That's her, ain't it?"
Grampa Simpson,Kids love that water.
Officer Noble,Oh my Lord!
Officer Goodman,Stupid babies need the most attention.

FROM SPEAKER,All is well... all is well... You are floating away on a soft cloud of --
FROM SPEAKER,Turn tape over!..
FROM SPEAKER,All is well... all is well...
Marge Simpson,
,
Officer Noble,"Children, where are your parents?"
Lisa Simpson,I don't know. They should be here.
Officer Goodman,Yes. They should be here.
Officer Goodman,Those parents better have a good excuse.
Homer Simpson,I love gettin' away from this dump.
Marge Simpson,It's like I'm on some wonderful drug!
Officer Goodman,
Marge Simpson,What's going on here?
Officer Goodman,"Child Welfare, Ma'am."
Officer Noble,Here's a little bedtime reading.
Marge Simpson,Squalid hell hole... toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion... Dogs mating on dining room table?
Marge Simpson,What are you doing with my children?!
Officer Noble,We're taking them where you can't get them.
Marge Simpson,What?! No! You can't! I won't let you!
Officer Noble,Mrs. Simpson. Restrain yourself or you'll be arrested.
Officer Goodman,"Now just relax, kids. All we're doing is taking you to a foster home!"
Lisa Simpson,
Todd Flanders,Yay!
Ned Flanders,"Heydilly-ho! Welcome to your new home, neglect-areenos!"
,
Officer Goodman,"Kids, meet your new foster family."
Rod Flanders,We love you!
Bart Simpson,"Uh, please don't hug me. It sickens me."
Maude Flanders,"I don't judge Homer and Marge, that's for a vengeful God to do."
Ned Flanders,Mmm-hmm. All we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
Lisa Simpson,You don't understand. Mom and Dad take good care of us.
Lisa Simpson,That was a baby tooth... it was loose...
Officer Noble,"Don't you worry, little girl. We'll get you some nice county dentures."
,
Marge Simpson,Parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
Homer Simpson,We leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch."
Homer Simpson,Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.
Marge Simpson,I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. That is so like me.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant."
Homer Simpson,Lousy houseplant!
,
Todd Flanders,Go with it!
Bart Simpson,"Here you go, Todd. The city edition."
Rod Flanders,"Bart, I don't know if this should be an extra."
Todd Flanders,Is your source on this reliable?
Bart Simpson,I hate this place.
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah. It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy Pat Boone-ish quality to it."
Ned Flanders,"Hey, kids! Nachos, Flanders-style! That's cucumbers with cottage cheese."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Bart. I know you're still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. We'll do whatever you want to do."
Bart Simpson,Watch Itchy and Scratchy!
Ned Flanders,"Well, I guess a little television won't hurt. I used to let the boys watch ""My Three Sons,"" but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime."
Scratchy,Why? Why? My only son.
Rod Flanders,"Daddy, what's the red stuff coming out of Kitty's ears?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, er, that's just raspberry jam."
Todd Flanders,"Dad, should I poke Rod with a sharp thing like the mouse did?"
Ned Flanders,"No, son. No sirree, Bob."
,
Marge Simpson,Can you see them?
,
Automated Voice,The number you have dialed can no longer be reached from this phone... you negligent monster.
Marge Simpson,That's it. We're going downtown to get our kids back. Right now!
,
,
Marge Simpson,"We've always tried to be good parents. Please, I'm begging you, one mother to another -- you must have a family."
Judge Snyder,"No, I don't care for children."
Homer Simpson,"Now wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year. In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. Wait, can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day... I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa!"
Judge Snyder,And Margaret?
Homer Simpson,"Who? Lady, you got the wrong file."
Marge Simpson,It's Maggie!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Maggie. I got nothing against Maggie."
Judge Snyder,"I can see you sincerely want your children back. But you have a lot to learn about being parents. Before I can return your children, you'll have to complete a course called Family Skills. It teaches parents to listen to their..."
Homer Simpson,Communication. Gotcha.
Judge Snyder,But it's important to...
Homer Simpson,"Listen. Yes, I know."
Judge Snyder,But there's more to it than...
Homer Simpson,I have listening skills!
Judge Snyder,"Mr. Simpson, would you please --"
Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Judge!"
,
Ned Flanders,Peek-a-boo! I see you!
Maggie Simpson,
Ned Flanders,Peek-a-boo! I see you!
Maggie Simpson,
Bart Simpson,I never heard Maggie laugh like that before.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention?"
Bart Simpson,"When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her."
Lisa Simpson,"I thought I could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here."
Bart Simpson,I know. They put honey on their pancakes instead of maple syrup.
Lisa Simpson,And they read Newsweek instead of nothing.
Ned Flanders,"C'mon, you Gloomy Gusses. Who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?"
Todd Flanders,I want wintergreen!
Maude Flanders,Unflavored for me!
,
,
Marge Simpson,...and then I saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice!
Father In Burlap Sack,Is this story goin' somewhere?
Officer Goodman,"All right. Easy there, Flub. We're all gonna get a chance. Mrs. Skinner, why are you here?"
Agnes Skinner,The county is threatening to take my Seymour away. We had another fight over the inflatable bath pillow. I kept screeching and screeching at him but--
Officer Goodman,"All right... Very good. Now, who knows how the Skinners could have resolved this problem...without resorting to violence...or childish name-calling?"
Officer Goodman,"Anybody? Okay, that's okay, because making a happy home isn't like flipping on a light switch."
Cletus Spuckler,Light switch?
Officer Goodman,"There are a lot of little tricks to it, things you should have learned a long time ago. Such as: If you leave milk out, it can go sour. Put it in the refrigerator, or failing that, a cool, wet sack..."
Officer Goodman,"And put your garbage in a garbage can, people. I can't stress that enough. Don't just throw it out the window."
Marge Simpson,This is so humiliating.
Homer Simpson,Garbage in garbage can. Makes sense.
,
Ned Flanders,"Nighty night, my sweet li'l foundling-a-dings."
Bart Simpson,But it's only 7 o'clock.
Lisa Simpson,Yeah. The sun is still out.
Lisa Simpson,
Maude Flanders,THEY SAY YOUR FOLKS CAN'T PAY THE RENT/ SO WE'RE WATCHING YOU BY ACT OF GOVERNMENT.
Ned Flanders,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE / BUT YOU GOT US, AND BABY, WE GOT YOU."
Ned Flanders,"BABE. WE GOT YOU, BABE."
Lisa Simpson,"You know, Maggie hasn't been a Simpson as long as us. I think she's beginning to forget Mom and Dad."
Bart Simpson,Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
Lisa Simpson,Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,They're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them. I wish I could tell them how much I miss them.
,
Marge Simpson,It's so quiet here without the kids.
Homer Simpson,What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
Marge Simpson,"I miss the way Bart would say something and then say ""dude."""
Homer Simpson,I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
Marge Simpson,You mean Maggie?
Homer Simpson,That's it.
Marge Simpson,We've never been separated from the kids for so long. I don't know how much more I can take.
Marge Simpson,There's Bart's ring!
Homer Simpson,"Todd Smells. Aw, I already knew that."
Marge Simpson,"Well, look at the other side."
Marge Simpson,
,
Officer Goodman,"Okay, let's see if we've learned anything. I want you two to simulate a typical household problem... Go!"
Cletus Spuckler,"Paw, I cut myself on the screen door again."
Homer Simpson,Why you cotton pickin' --
Cletus Spuckler,
Homer Simpson,"No! I've gotta pass this class for my kids. Son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
Cletus Spuckler,"I love you, Paw!"
Homer Simpson,"I love you, Cletus!"
,
Ned Flanders,"Well, children, it's Saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play Bombardment..."
Lisa Simpson,Yay!
Ned Flanders,...of Bible questions.
Todd Flanders,Yay!
Ned Flanders,Which version shall it be?
Todd Flanders,St. James!
Rod Flanders,The Vulgate of St. Jerome!
Ned Flanders,Vulgate it is.
Todd Flanders,
Ned Flanders,Okay. For one gold star: What Persian king exempted the Levites from taxation?
Rod Flanders,Ataxerxes!
Ned Flanders,Righty-o!
Ned Flanders,Well...
Rod Flanders,I know!
Ned Flanders,"No, Son, we've got to let Bart and Lisa get one. C'mon, this one's easy."
Lisa Simpson,We give up.
Ned Flanders,"Well, guess! Book of Revelations... Fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... Who else is it gonna be?!"
Bart Simpson,Jesus?
Ned Flanders,Jes... ? Jes... ? Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Rehaboam? The well of Zohassadar? The bridal feast of Beth Chadruharazzeb?
Maude Flanders,"Why, that's the kind of thing you should start learning at baptism."
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, actually, the... We were never baptized."
Ned Flanders,
Maude Flanders,"Oh, Neddie! Neddie! Neddie!"
Ned Flanders,"No, that ain't gonna do it."
,
Officer Goodman,"I'm very proud of you people. You've learned how to care for your children, how to maintain your homes, and you've all passed the drug test -- except for Marge. Marge, you tested positive for crack and PCP."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my."
Officer Goodman,"Okay, the re-test says you're clean. Sorry about the mistake."
Marge Simpson,"The only thing I'm high on is love. Love for my son and daughters. Yes, a little ""L.S.D."" is all I need."
Officer Goodman,"All right, sounds very good."
,
Ned Flanders,Jeepers H. Crackers! I'd better call the Reverend!
,
Helen Lovejoy,Ned Flanders is on the phone.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Hello, Ned..."
Ned Flanders,Reverend... Emergency... I... You... Simpson kids... Eedily... Baptism... Oodily... Doodily-doodily...
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ned, have you thought about one of the other major religions? They're all pretty much the same."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Damn Flanders.
Ned Flanders,Looks like I'm gonna have to baptize you myself.
,
Homer Simpson,"Kids, we're good parents now! Get your asses out here!"
Marge Simpson,We missed you so much!
Marge Simpson,He's going to baptize our children?
Homer Simpson,Oh no! In the eyes of God they'll be Flanderseseseses!
,
Ned Flanders,"Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents. But now I know you kids need a less hellbound family."
Bart Simpson,
Maude Flanders,"Just sit back, and before you know it, you'll be part of the Flanders flock."
Bart Simpson,Ha ha. You're gonna be Lisa Flanders.
Lisa Simpson,You're gonna be Bart Flanders.
Bart Simpson,
Maude Flanders,"Oh, relax, Bart. Your sister Maggie isn't scared."
Bart Simpson,That's because she can't talk.
Maggie Simpson,Daddilly-doodily.
,
Marge Simpson,Where we going? Where we going?
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, don't panic. To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders!"
Homer Simpson,The Springfield River!
,
Todd Flanders,"I ONCE WAS LOST, BUT NOW AM FOUND / WAS BLIND BUT NOW I SEE!"
Ned Flanders,Today we write a new page in the Flanders family bible.
,
Ned Flanders,Who wants to be the first to enter God's good graces?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Easy, easy."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, why do you hate my trains?"
,
Homer Simpson,Son of a bitch...
Ned Flanders,"Do you reject Satan, and all his empty promises?"
Homer Simpson,Noooooooo!
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Wow, Dad, you took a baptismal for me. How do you feel?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Bartholemew, I feel like St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan."
Ned Flanders,"Wait, Homer. What did you just say?"
Homer Simpson,"I said shut your ugly face, Flanders."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, fair enough."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Maggie, you're a Simpson again!"
Maggie Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"So, what was it like at the Flanders' house?"
Homer Simpson,Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!
Bart Simpson,Like I don't have a soul?
Lisa Simpson,"Let's see. Dirt... dirt... Well, there wasn't really much dirt."
Bart Simpson,"There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though."
Homer Simpson,Old painty-can Ned!
Lisa Simpson,
,
,
Bart Simpson,Hymns here! I got hymns here! Get 'em while they're holy! Fresh from God's brain to your mouth!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"And now please rise for our opening hymn... Uh, ""In the Garden of Eden"" by ""I. Ron Butterfly?"""
Congregation,"IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, HONEY / DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU? / IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, BABY / DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I'LL ALWAYS BE TRUE...?"
Bart Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?"
Marge Simpson,
Congregation,"OH, WON'T YOU COME WITH ME AND TAKE MY HAND? / OH, WON'T YOU COME WITH ME AND WALK THIS LAND?"
Seymour Skinner,PLEASE TAKE MY HA-A-A-ND!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Wait a minute -- This sounds like rock and/or roll.
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"I know one of you is responsible for this. So repeat after me: If I withhold the truth, may I go straight to hell, where I will eat naught but burning hot coals and drink naught but burning hot cola..."
Ralph Wiggum,... where fiery demons will punch me in the back...
Kids,... where fiery demons will punch me in the back...
Bart Simpson,...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
Kids,... where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
Milhouse Van Houten,...where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds...
Kids,... where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds...
Crow,
Milhouse Van Houten,Bart did it! That Bart right there!
Bart Simpson,Milhouse!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Milhouse, you did the right thing. Bart, come with me for punishment. You too, Snitchy."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"I want you to clean every one of these organ pipes that you have befouled with your ""popular music."""
Bart Simpson,You shank. How could you tell on me?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I didn't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever."
Bart Simpson,"Soul? Come on, Milhouse. There's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson."
Milhouse Van Houten,"But every religion says there's a soul, Bart. Why would they lie? What would they have to gain?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I don't hear scrubbing.
Bart Simpson,"Well, if your soul's real, where is it?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"It's kinda in here. And when you sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape. Saying ""God bless you"" crams it back in. And when you die, it squirms out and flies away."
Bart Simpson,Uh huh. What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, it can swim. It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert and it has to drive to the cemetery."
Bart Simpson,"How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? Listen. You don't have a soul, I don't have a soul, there's no such thing as a soul."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Fine. If you're so sure about that, why don't you sell your soul to me."
Bart Simpson,How much you got?
Milhouse Van Houten,Five bucks.
Bart Simpson,Deal.
Bart Simpson,There you go: one soul.
Milhouse Van Houten,Pleasure doing business with you.
Bart Simpson,"Any time, chummmmm...p."

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"All right, where would you kids like to eat tonight?"
Pre-Teen Hibbert Kid,The Spaghetti Laboratory!
Little Hibbert Girl,FaceStuffers!
Teenage Hibbert Boy,Professor V.J. Cornucopia's Fantastic Foodmagorium and Great American Steakery!
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, what about this place? ""Moe's."""
,
Barney Gumble,Agh! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was a family restaurant."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table."
Little Hibbert Girl,"Daddy, this place smells like tinkle."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Mmm-hmm, I think we'll just go to The Texas Cheesecake Depository."
Moe Szyslak,Everybody is goin' to family restaurants these days. Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.
Carl Carlson,"Ya ain't thinking of gettin' rid of the dank, are ya, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, maybe I am."
Carl Carlson,"Aw, but Moe, the dank. The dank!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Family restaurants. That's where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?"
Homer Simpson,I'm not ashamed.
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, put a coaster under that."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, Li-sa. There's a little present for you lying in the driveway."
Lisa Simpson,Oh boy! Really?
Dinosaur,
Lisa Simpson,Nooooo! It's dripping funny-smelling water all over me!
Bart Simpson,I wasted five bucks on these.
Lisa Simpson,Where'd you get five bucks? I want five bucks.
Bart Simpson,I sold my soul to Milhouse.
Lisa Simpson,What? How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you!
Bart Simpson,You believe in that junk?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything fine inside us."
Bart Simpson,"Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years."
Bart Simpson,"Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my conscience for four-fifty."
Marge Simpson,"Aw, honey, you're not a monster."
Bart Simpson,"I'll throw in my sense of decency, too. It's a Bart sales event! Everything about me must go!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, boy. How ya doin'?"
Santa's Little Helper,
Bart Simpson,"Man, what's gotten into you?"
Snowball II,
Bart Simpson,Geez. You're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.

Moe Szyslak,"So come on. I need a name that says friendly, all-American cooking."
Homer Simpson,How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok?
Barney-Shaped Form,I like it!
Moe Szyslak,"Nah. I want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time."
Homer Simpson,I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker!
Barney-Shaped Form,I like it!
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, how about Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag?"
Barney-Shaped Form,I hate it.
Moe Szyslak,Oh boy. The deep fryer's here.
Moe Szyslak,I got it used from the Navy. You can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.
Homer Simpson,Forty seconds? But I want it now.
,
Bart Simpson,"I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing."
Lisa Simpson,Hmmm... Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
Bart Simpson,I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.
Lisa Simpson,I think we should do a test.
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Well?
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"That's creepy, Bart. I think you really did lose your soul."
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Nothing.
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, is Milhouse home?"
Luann Van Houten,"He's playing in the dirt with his army men... oh, and a white piece of paper, I believe."
Bart Simpson,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Cover me, Sarge! I'm going after Bart's soul. If the Ayatollah can't have it, no one can!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Ah, you know, Milhouse --"
Milhouse Van Houten,Yeesss?
Bart Simpson,"Bet you're getting tired of that soul, huh?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Nooooo.
Bart Simpson,Suppose someone wanted to buy it from you?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, you want to buy it back, Bart? Sure. No problem..."
Milhouse Van Houten,...Fifty bucks.
Bart Simpson,What?!
Milhouse Van Houten,Who's stupid now? Huh?

Jinglers,"COME TO UNCLE MOE'S FOR FAMILY FUN / IT'S GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD."
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Sounds good.
,
Marge Simpson,"Hmm. Bart, what's wrong? There's something a little off about your hug."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I need to tell you something. I kinda--"
Marge Simpson,"Uh, uh, uh, let me guess. A mother can always tell. Hmm, it's not fear of nuclear war. Hmm, it's not swim test anxiety. It almost feels like you're missing something. Something important."
SHERRI/TERRI/THEIR SOULS,"BART SOLD HIS SOUL AND THAT'S JUST SWELL / NOW HE'S GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL-O OPERATOR, GIVE ME NUMBER NINE / AND IF YOU DISCONNECT ME, I'LL..."

Bart Simpson,"When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper?"
Figure,"Oh, yeah. You don't forget a thing like that."

Homer Simpson,"Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?"
Homer Simpson,"What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?"

Milhouse Van Houten,"I'm really sorry. I kinda traded your soul to the guy at the comic book store. But look, I got some cool POGS."
Milhouse Van Houten,Alf POGS. Remember Alf? He's back in POG form.
Bart Simpson,You traded my soul for POGS?! Noooo!!
Nana Van Houten,"Oh, close that door. You're letting the heat out."
Kirk Van Houten,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Comic Book Guy,"If you are waiting for the ""Hi & Lois"" signing, it has been moved to the Springfield Coliseum."
Bart Simpson,Please. You have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
Comic Book Guy,"Oh, so you're Bart Simpson, eh?"
,
100 Flanderses,Okily dokily.
Comic Book Guy,"Well, since my breakfast burrito is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt. You're too late. I sold your soul last night. Yes, yes, I found a buyer right away for that item."
Bart Simpson,Who?
Comic Book Guy,"I'm not at liberty to divulge the party, but they were most interested in having possession of a little boy's soul."
Comic Book Guy,"Excuse me. No banging your head on the display case, please. It contains a very rare ""Mary Worth"" in which she has advised a friend to commit suicide. Thank you."

Bart Simpson,"Are you there, God? It's me, Bart Simpson. I know I never paid too much attention in church, but I could really use some of that good stuff now. I'm afraid. I'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul and I don't know what they're doing to it. I just want it back. Please. I hope you can hear this..."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Lisa! You bought this?
Lisa Simpson,With the change in my piggy bank.
Bart Simpson,There's no change in your piggy bank.
Lisa Simpson,Not in any of the ones you know about.
Bart Simpson,"Oh Lis, thank you."
Lisa Simpson,"Happy to do it. But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer, like you did last night."
Bart Simpson,Uh huh.

Homer Simpson,No.
Grampa Simpson,Are we there yet?
Homer Simpson,No.
Grampa Simpson,Where are we going?
Lisa Simpson,"We're going to Storytown Village, Grampa. It's an amusement park for babies."
Grampa Simpson,Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
Homer Simpson,That's the plan.
Marge Simpson,"I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once. Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone... from 8, to... God only knows."

Grampa Simpson,
Wolf,"Come out, come out, or I'll blow your house in."
Pigs,Not by the hairs of our chinny-chinny-chin.
Bart Simpson,What a load of crappy-crap-crap.
Homer Simpson,"Quiet, boy. I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down."
Marge Simpson,This is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house!
Bart Simpson,He blows all right. He blows big time.
Marge Simpson,"That's it, Honey. Get into the spirit."
Homer Simpson,"It was good, but not great."

Homer Simpson,Aww.

Marge Simpson,See? It was a good idea to come here after all.
Mother Goose,"Attention, families. This is Mother Goose. The following cars have been broken into..."

Homer Simpson,Hey Flanders!
100 Flanderses,"Hidilly ho, neighboreeno!"
Homer Simpson,Shut up.
Homer Simpson,"So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, gosh, Homer, this is strictly a Flanders affair. I've got family here from around the globe! Here's JosÃ© Flanders..."
Jose Flanders,"Buenas ding-dong-diddly-dias, seÃ±or."
Ned Flanders,And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders...
Thistlewick Flanders,Charmed.
Thistlewick Flanders,"Eh, a-googily-doogily."
Ned Flanders,
Homer Simpson,I can't believe you didn't invite me after I painted those cool stripes all over your car. I know! I'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show ya.
Ned Flanders,Can I come?
Homer Simpson,Sure.
Homer Simpson,"This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge."
Marge Simpson,"Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting."
Homer Simpson,"You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever."
Marge Simpson,"Why thank you, Homie. You might say the extra ingredient is salt."
Lamb,"Please, Lisa. I thought you lo-o-o-ved me. Lo-o-o-ved me!"
Marge Simpson,What's wrong Lisa? Didn't you get enough lamb chops?
Lisa Simpson,I can't eat this. I can't eat a poor little lamb!
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb."
Lisa Simpson,What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?
Bart Simpson,This one spent two hours in the broiler.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, sensible bites! All right Lisa. If you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things I can make: chicken breast, rump roast, hot dogs..."
Lisa Simpson,"No, I can't! I can't eat any of them!"
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon?"
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Ham?
Lisa Simpson,NO!
Homer Simpson,Pork chops?
Lisa Simpson,Dad... those all come from the same animal.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal."
Bart Simpson,"I think Lisa's right, dad. Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's my chop!"
Bart Simpson,

Lisa Simpson,"Oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism."
Lisa Simpson,"Compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment."
Miss Hoover,"Okay class, time to dissect our worms."
Class,Yay!
Miss Hoover,"First, pin them down so they don't fly up and hit you in the eye."
Ralph Wiggum,"Ah, Ms. Hoover?"
MS. HOOVER,"Yes, Ralph? What is it?"
Ralph Wiggum,My worm went in my mouth and then I ate it. Can I have a new one?
Miss Hoover,No Ralph. There aren't any more. Just try to sleep while the other children are learning.
Ralph Wiggum,"Oh boy, sleep! That's where I'm a Viking."
Worm,"Lisa, what did I ever do to yo-o-o-ou?"
Lisa Simpson,Why does it talk like a lamb?
Lisa Simpson,Ah... Miss Hoover? I don't think I can dissect an animal. I think it's wrong.
Miss Hoover,"Okay, Lisa. I respect your moral objection."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Ah, excuse me? Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?"
Lunchlady Doris,Possibly the meat loaf.
Lisa Simpson,Well I believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative.
Lunchlady Doris,Mmmm. It's rich in bunly goodness.
Lisa Simpson,Do you remember when you lost your passion for this work?

Lisa Simpson,"I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny."
Bart Simpson,"Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa. They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. Stuff like that."
Homer Simpson,"Look, kids! I just got my party invitations back from the printer's."
Lisa Simpson,Come to Homer's BBBQ. The Extra B is for BYOBB.
Bart Simpson,What's that extra b for?
Homer Simpson,That's a typo.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat?"
Homer Simpson,"But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, ""Yo, Goober! Where's the meat?"" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa. You don't win friends with salad."
Bart Simpson,YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
Bart Simpson,YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
Marge Simpson,YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DON'T WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
Lisa Simpson,Mom.
Marge Simpson,I didn't mean to take sides. I just got caught up in the rhythm.

Seymour Skinner,"Good morning class. A certain agitator -- for privacy's sake let's call her Lisa S. -- No, that's too obvious. Uh, let's say L. Simpson -- has raised questions about certain school policies. So in the interest of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film."

Child Voice,Mr. McClure?
Troy McClure,"Oh, hello, Bobby."
JIMMY,Jimmy. I'm curious as to how meat gets from the ranch to my stomach.
Everybody,Huh? / What? / Gazpacho? / Etc.
Lisa Simpson,It's tomato soup served ice cold!
Troy McClure,"Whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, Jimmy! You just asked a mouthful. It all starts here in the high-density feed lot. Then when the cattle are just right...it's time for them to ""graduate"" from ""Bovine University."""
Troy McClure,"C'mon, Jimmy. Let's take a peek at the killing floor."
JIMMY,
Troy McClure,"Don't let the name throw you, Jimmy. It's not really a floor. It's more of a steel grating that allows material to sluice through so it can be collected and exported."
,
Troy McClure,"Gettin' hungry, Jimmy?"
JIMMY,"Ahh, Mr. McClure? I have a crazy friend who says it's wrong to eat meat. Is he crazy?"
Troy McClure,"No, just ignorant. You see, your crazy friend never heard of the ""food chain."""
Troy McClure,Just ask this scientician.
Scientist,Uhhh --
Troy McClure,"He'll tell you that in nature, one creature invariably eats another to survive."
Troy McClure,"Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about."
JIMMY,"Wow, Mr. McClure, I was a Grade-A moron to ever question eating meat."
Troy McClure,"Yes you were, Jimmy. Yes you were."
JIMMY,You're hurting me.
Lisa Simpson,They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe!
Seymour Skinner,"Now as a special treat courtesy of our friends at the Meat Council, please help yourselves to this tripe."
Lisa Simpson,Stop it! Stop it! Don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda?
JANEY,Apparently my crazy friend here hasn't heard of the food chain.
Ham,Yeah. Lisa's a Grade-A moron.
Ralph Wiggum,When I grow up I'm going to Bovine University.

Homer Simpson,One whopper for the copper.
Bart Simpson,"Can I have a burger, dad?"
Homer Simpson,Here ya go!

Lisa Simpson,It's bad enough they're all eating meat. They don't have to rub it in my face.

Chief Wiggum,Look at his nose!
Ned Flanders,"Congratulations, Homer. Your Q is a huge success. A toast to the host who can boast the most roast."
Homer Simpson,Thanks Flanders. I have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
Marge Simpson,"Bart, no!"
Bart Simpson,What?
Marge Simpson,"Sorry, force of habit. Lisa, no!"

Bart Simpson,"Give it up, dad. Piggy ain't comin' back."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, you ruined my barbecue. I demand you apologize this second!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, then you must think I'm a monster."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm never ever apologizing because I was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room."
Homer Simpson,That's it! Go to your room!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?"
Marge Simpson,"Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product."
Bart Simpson,"You dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning."
Marge Simpson,"Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you're not not talking to me. And secondly, I heard what you said."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, go to your room!"
Lisa Simpson,"Why don't you just eat him, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"I don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all."
Lisa Simpson,That's it. I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. I am out of here.
Homer Simpson,That's it. Go to your room.

Lisa Simpson,Yes. I'm gonna marry a carrot.
Kids,She admitted it! / She admitted she's gonna marry a carrot! / I can't believe it!
Lisa Simpson,The whole world wants me to eat meat. I can't fight it anymore.
Lisa Simpson,THERE! IS EVERYBODY HAPPY NOW?!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I take it from your yelling that you like my tofu dogs.
Lisa Simpson,Tofu?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, I don't eat any food that comes from an animal."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, yes. No meat whatsoever, and only thrice the fat of a normal hot dog. I made the switch and nobody noticed."
Lisa Simpson,"But why, Apu?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Because I'm a vegetarian. Haven't you ever seen my T-shirt?
Lisa Simpson,That's cute.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yeah. Let me show you something, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, a secret staircase? But what do you do if somebody wants a non-alcoholic beer?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"You know, it's never come up."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Apu! It's beautiful!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, this is where I come when I need some refuge from the modern world. Or when I want to see drive-in movies for free."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I know it is not easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,That's why I ran away from home.
Voice,What? She's leaving home?
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, Paul McCartney! I read about you in history class. But where's your wife, Linda?"
Linda McCartney,"Right here, Lisa. Whenever we're in Springfield, we like to hang out in Apu's garden in the shade."
Paul McCartney,We met him in India years ago during the Maharishi days.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Back then I was known as the fifth Beatle.
Paul McCartney,"Sure you were, Apu."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"You know what, Lisa, Paul and Linda are vegetarians too. In fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees."
Lisa Simpson,"Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is..."
Linda McCartney,We weren't satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the market. You'd be surprised how often you find a big hunk of pork in 'em.
Lisa Simpson,Ewwww.
Paul McCartney,"Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights. In fact, if you play ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" backwards, you'll hear a recipe for a really ripping lentil soup."
Lisa Simpson,"When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and cheese?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Cheese?!
Lisa Simpson,"You don't eat cheese, Apu?"
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, indeed I do think that. But, I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, ""Live and Let Live."""
Paul McCartney,"Actually, it was ""Live and Let Die."""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, whatever, whatever. It had a good rhythm."
Lisa Simpson,"I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people. Especially my dad. Thanks, you guys."
Paul McCartney,"Lisa, before you go, would you like to hear a song?"
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, that'd be great!"
Paul McCartney,Okay. Take it Apu.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I'm Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Man... I hope I will enjoy my show...

Lisa Simpson,"Actually Dad, this time I was wrong..."
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,...too.
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney."
Homer Simpson,Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?
Lisa Simpson,"I still stand by my beliefs, but I can't defend what I did. I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue."

Mr. Van Brunt,"Exactly. If you stop paying attention to the monsters, they'll lose their powers."
Lisa Simpson,But people can't help looking at them. They're wrecking the town.

Lisa Simpson,"It's no use, Bart. We can't stay up forever."
Bart Simpson,"You're right. The only thing left to do is to go into my dream and force Willie into a final showdown. You stay awake, and if it looks like I'm in trouble, wake me up."

,
Lisa Simpson,"You saved us, Maggie!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"I don't know, Bart. Something tells me Willie's still out there, and that he could come back any time in any form and kill us in ways we can't even imagine."
Groundskeeper Willie,
Groundskeeper Willie,Stop! I left my gun on the seat!
Groundskeeper Willie,"Wait here, please."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Aw, geez!"
Marge Simpson,Homer? Get ready. Patty and Selma will be here any minute.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Better ride this one out in the closet."
Lisa Simpson,"Sorry, dad. This is our spot."
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well it's my house, so it's my spot."
Bart Simpson,"Nuh-uh, 'cause we called it."
Homer Simpson,Did not.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, we're calling it now."
Homer Simpson,You are?
Bart Simpson,'Fraid so.
Homer Simpson,They got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
Marge Simpson,Just a second!
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Huh? I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Do you see a light, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,That's weird. It's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
Patty Bouvier,"How's it hangin', Marge?"
Selma Bouvier,Ugh. I'm baking like a meatloaf under this wet wool.
Bart Simpson,"Uh, may I take your coat, Aunt Selma?"
Lisa Simpson,"Um, I would also like to take your coat."
Selma Bouvier,Have we got a family activity for you! A pillowcase full of seashells from our trip to Sulfur Bay.
Patty Bouvier,You're gonna help us clean and organize 'em. And pry out all the dead hermit crabs. Get a screwdriver.
Homer Simpson,I'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
Homer's Mouth,Holy macaroni!
Patty Bouvier,Hey! You can just suck 'em out!
Homer Simpson,Hello? Can anybody hear me?
Marge Simpson,Homer? Where are you?
Homer Simpson,I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
Marge Simpson,"Do you see towels? If you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again."
Homer Simpson,"Just a second... No, it's a place I've never been before."
Selma Bouvier,"Ah, the shower!"
Homer Simpson,Hey!
Homer Simpson,"I don't want to alarm you, Marge..."
Homer Simpson,But I seem to be trapped in here.
Marge Simpson,We better call Ned. He has a ladder.
Homer Simpson,What's going on here? I'm so bulgy...
Homer Simpson,My stomach sticks way out in front and my...
Homer Simpson,
Ned Flanders,"Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack -- I'm stumped."
Selma Bouvier,Hunh. It's like he just disappeared into fat air.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, shut up!"
Homer Simpson,Mmm... Unprocessed fish sticks.
Homer Simpson,"Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it."
Homer Simpson,"Ow! Watch it, coney."
Homer Simpson,Oops.
Homer Simpson,Yes.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Move into the light, my son."
Homer Simpson,Ow!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Homer, this is your physician, Dr. Julius Hibbert. Can you tell us what it's like in there?"
Homer Simpson,"Um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie ""Tron""?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,No.
Lisa Simpson,No.
Chief Wiggum,No.
Marge Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,No.
Patty Bouvier,No.
Chief Wiggum,No.
Ned Flanders,No.
Selma Bouvier,No.
Professor Jonathan Frink,No.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,No.
Chief Wiggum,Yes. I mean no. No.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, where's my dad?"
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Well, that should be obvious to even the most dimwitted individual -- who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology -- that Homer Simpson has stumbled into... the Third Dimension."
Lisa Simpson,Sorry.
Professor Jonathan Frink,Here is an ordinary square...
Chief Wiggum,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Egghead!"
Professor Jonathan Frink,"But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe, along the hypothetical Z axis there."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"This forms a three-dimensional object known as a ""cube"" or a ""Frinkahedron"", in honor of its discoverer ."
Homer Simpson,"Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Oh, right, and of course, within we find the doomed individual."
Chief Wiggum,"Enough of your borax, Poindexter! A man's life is at stake! We need action!"
Chief Wiggum,"Take that, you lousy dimension!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics. I wish I'd read that book by that wheelchair guy."
Homer Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,I'll save Homer. All I needs is four stout men to work the bellows.
Professor Jonathan Frink,"No, Pops, it's too risky. For all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large..."
Homer Simpson,Help! I don't have much time!
Maggie Simpson,
Bart Simpson,That does it. I'm going in.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, no!"
Bart Simpson,"Cool, man!"
Homer Simpson,I'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... I'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! I don't know...
Bart Simpson,"I'll save you, Dad."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I can't get any closer! You'll have to jump!"
Homer Simpson,"Piece of cake, son!"
Homer Simpson,Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap!
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Bart, what happened?!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic."
Homer Simpson,Craaaaaaaaaap!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie..."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Be strong, Marge. I'm sure he's gone to a better place."
,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Eww. This is the worst place yet.
Homer Simpson,Omigod...
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, erotic cakes!"
,
Waylon Smithers,"C'mon, Simpson! Open up! We know you're in there!"
,
Waylon Smithers,Hmm... That one!
Homer Simpson,Someone's in here.
Homer Simpson,Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo!
Waylon Smithers,"Boy, I've never seen a man so desperate to get out of five minutes of calisthenics."
C. Montgomery Burns,"One, two, three, four! Up, down, three, four..."
Carl Carlson,This new exercise program is great!
Lenny Leonard,Yeah. Every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. Especially my big fat mouth.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah! Especially your big fat... Oh, wait."
C. Montgomery Burns,Raise your right hock. Aerate! Raise your left hock. Aerate! I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts!
Homer Simpson,TWO!
Lenny Leonard,"Actually, Homer, that's just one. See, each push-up includes both an ""up"" part and a ""down"" part."
Homer Simpson,Arrgh!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?"
Carl Carlson,"Aw, he's at home on disability."
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay. Pfft. It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity."
Homer Simpson,"Stupidity, eh?"
Homer Simpson,Must hurt self. Must hurt self. Must hurt self.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, probably better that didn't hit me."
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes?
Homer Simpson,Hello.
C. Montgomery Burns,May I help you?
Homer Simpson,"Um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Okay.
Homer Simpson,Thank you.
Homer Simpson,"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? No. Lumber Lung? No. Juggler's Despair? No. Achy-Breaky Pelvis? No. Oh, I'm never gonna be disabled. I'm sick of being so healthy!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait... ""Hyper-Obesity."" ""If you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""
Pig,"You can do it, old boy!"
Homer Simpson,Yes I can.
Pig,"Yes, yes. That's the spirit!"
,
Bart Simpson,"If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home?"
Homer Simpson,"Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!"
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I know we don't do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of."
Lisa Simpson,Dad--
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,I must protest. You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
Homer Simpson,"I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. But try to see it my way. All my life I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body."
Lisa Simpson,Have you told mom about this?
Homer Simpson,"No. It would only worry her. If you want to add to her worries, go ahead. I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us."
Lisa Simpson,Da-ad!
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sweetheart?"
Lisa Simpson,Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that.
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, Little Miss Smart Guy."
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"My God, that's monstrous... I've never heard of anything so neglige-- I'll have no part of it."
Homer Simpson,Can you recommend a doctor who will?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Yes.
,
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hi, everybody!"
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Doctor Nick!"
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. I recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology."
Homer Simpson,Of course.
Dr. Nick Riviera,"You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic."
Homer Simpson,"What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?"
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Be creative. Instead of making sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts. Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon."
Bart Simpson,You could brush your teeth with milkshakes!
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College, too?"
,
Dr. Nick Riviera,"And remember, if you're not sure about something, rub it against a piece of paper."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Bye-bye, everybody!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything I've always wanted. Now c'mon! Every second I'm out of bed, I'm burning precious calories. Now get grabbin'!"
Bart Simpson,"Eat around the banana, Dad, it's just empty vitamins."
Muscular Guy,"Lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work."
Homer Simpson,I don't know... fish sandwich? Are you sure?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight!"
Bart Simpson,"Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Four more pounds and my dream comes true: Working at home...
Marge Simpson,Here's your lemonade and here's your beer.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. When's your next coffee break?"
Homer Simpson,Any time I want.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders, bad day at the rat races?"
Ned Flanders,Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis, come look at this."
Lisa Simpson,Neat!
,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, honey."
Marge Simpson,"Hi. Ah, er, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week?"
Homer Simpson,"I was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- Honey, I'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability."
Marge Simpson,Have you lost your mind?! Have you thought about your health?... Or your appearance?
Homer Simpson,"So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow."
Marge Simpson,"Oh please, I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--"
Homer Simpson,Beautiful. G'night.
Homer Simpson,I've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.
Bart Simpson,"Bad news, Dad, we're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce."
Homer Simpson,I need a miracle.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut..."
Bart Simpson,"Dad? It says ""Non-Toxic."""
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's a plus."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it!
Bart Simpson,"Ah, Dad? Towel rack...?"
Homer Simpson,Oh my.
Homer Simpson,"Oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I am pleased to dedicate this remote work terminal. It will allow our safety inspector here to perform his duties from home. And so, excelsior to you, Mr. What's the name of this gastropod?"
Waylon Smithers,"Simpson, Sir. One of your chair-moisteners from Sector Seven-G."
C. Montgomery Burns,"... Yes, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,Thank you for your pity.
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this?"
Marge Simpson,Normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on TV. But this season...
,
,
,
Homer Simpson,I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work.
Salesman,"Work, huh? Let me guess: Computer programmer? Computer magazine columnist? Something with computers."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I use a computer!"
Salesman,"What's the connection? Must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. Well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. So we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes..."
Homer Simpson,I don't want to look like a weirdo. I'll just go with a muu-muu.

Arnie Pye,"Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute! Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets! Due to a fire at the Army Testing Lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the Expressway! Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable!"
Homer Simpson,I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.
Homer Simpson,Eight fifty-eight. First time I've ever been early for work. Except for all those daylight savings days. Lousy farmers.
Homer Simpson,"""To start, press any key."" Where's the ""any"" key?"
Homer Simpson,"I see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. There doesn't seem to be any ""any"" key. All this computer hacking is making me thirsty. I think I'll order a Tab."
Homer Simpson,Check core temperature? Yes-slash-No. Yes.
Homer Simpson,"Core temperature normal. Not too shabby. ""Vent radioactive gas?"" N-O."
Homer Simpson,Venting prevents explo-si-on. This is hard. Where's my Tab? Okay then -- yes. Vent the stupid gas.

Farmer,"Aw no, the corn! Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke."

Homer Simpson,Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.
Lisa Simpson,I like school.
Homer Simpson,"Well, why don't you live in it then?"
Lisa Simpson,I would if I could.
Bart Simpson,"Not me, sister. When I grow up I wanna be a lardo on workman's comp, just like Dad."
Bart Simpson,I wash myself with a rag on a stick.
Reporters,
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Eww! Mo-om!
Lisa Simpson,This whole thing is really creepy. Are you sure you won't talk to dad?
Marge Simpson,"I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how. Your father can be surprisingly sensitive. Remember when I giggled at his Sherlock Holmes hat? He sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings. The longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back."
Marge Simpson,"You're right. Maybe if I use my least nagging tone of voice. Homer? Homer! Homer! That's it. That's the one. All right, send him on in."
Lisa Simpson,Dad?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,Umm... Mom just baked a cake.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we need to have a serious talk."
Homer Simpson,You dragged me all the way from work for that?
Marge Simpson,"Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?"
Homer Simpson,I...
Marge Simpson,Con: You're endangering your health.
,
Marge Simpson,Con: You're setting a bad example for the children.
Homer Simpson,"Pro: I, uh... don't have to go to work."
Marge Simpson,Con: You're running the air conditioner non-stop. It's freezing in here.
Homer Simpson,Pro: Uhh... uhh... I love you?
Marge Simpson,Con: I am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of, right here."
Homer Simpson,"And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake?"
Marge Simpson,There's no cake.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Vent radioactive gas?... Y-E-S.
Homer Simpson,Sound alertness horn? Y-E-S.
Homer Simpson,"""Decalcify calcium ducts?"" Well, gimme a Y. Gimme a--"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, all I have to type is ""Y."""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Miss Doesn't-Find-Me-Attractive Sexually-Anymore. I just tripled my productivity."
Marge Simpson,Good. Good for you.
Homer Simpson,"Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y."
Homer Simpson,"Y, Y... What the heck are you doing over there?"
Homer Simpson,There. There. You found the floor.
Homer Simpson,YYY... Y... Y... Y...
Marge Simpson,I'm going out. I run errands during the day.
Homer Simpson,Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,The mail! The mail is here!
Homer Simpson,"Oooo! ""An Urgent Plea From Edward James Olmos!"" ""Lisa Simpson: Can you afford to miss another issue of The Utne Reader?"" Kids."
Homer Simpson,Free sample of fabric softener? Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, I can feel three kinds of softness."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, what are you doing down there?"
Homer Simpson,"Washing my fat guy hat, honey."
Announcer,"We now return to ""Search for the Sun."""

Glamorous Woman,"According to Daddy's will, I inherit the entire plantation."
Rugged Man,I'll see to it you don't get apricot one.
Milhouse Van Houten,Uh... What's your dad's job again?
Bart Simpson,He's a Nuclear Safety Technician.
Nelson Muntz,What's he doin' with that broom?
Bart Simpson,What isn't he doing?
Jimbo Jones,I heard that guy's ass has its own congressman.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, leave my dad alone. Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. He's a sweet man and he has real feelings."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what are you kids looking at?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, look. He's trying to get up to yell at us."
Homer Simpson,Don't make me close the shade!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside."
Homer Simpson,Nuts to that. I'm going to the movies.
Lisa Simpson,Shouldn't you be working?
Homer Simpson,I got someone to cover for me.
,
Homer Simpson,"One for ""Honk,"" please."
Ticket Seller,Uh... Gee...Uh... Just a minute. I have to check with the manager.
Manager,
Manager,"I'm terribly sorry, sir. But I'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs."
Homer Simpson,What are you talking about?
Manager,"Well, what I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't possibly fit in our seats."
Homer Simpson,I could sit in the aisle.
Manager,I'm afraid that would violate the fire code.
Moviegoer,"Hey, Fatty! I got a movie for ya -- ""A Fridge Too Far."""
Homer Simpson,"Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity! I just came here to see ""Honk If You're Horny"" in peace."
Manager,"Sir, if you'd just quiet down, I'd be happy to treat you to a garbage bag full of popcorn."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's raspberry."
Lisa Simpson,

Homer Simpson,"This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food! I'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes! The overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hard-working as everybody else. And they're gonna make their voices heard! All they need is a leader!"
,
Homer Simpson,"I'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! What happened to my bird?"

Worker #1,I'll take a rocket pop.
Worker #2,What can I get for thirty cents?

C. Montgomery Burns,"Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask."
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns... Can you make me thin again?
C. Montgomery Burns,I guarantee it.
C. Montgomery Burns,One... One... One...
C. Montgomery Burns,Bah! I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!

Homer Simpson,Hey everybody! Up here!
Waylon Smithers,"Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work!"
Homer Simpson,"Right away, Mr. Smithers! I'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --"
Carl Carlson,"Oh, no! He's going over the falls!"
Lenny Leonard,"Oh, good! He snagged that tree branch!"
Carl Carlson,Oh no! The branch broke off!
Lenny Leonard,Oh good! He can grab onto them pointy rocks!
Carl Carlson,Oh no! The rocks broke his arms and legs!
Lenny Leonard,Oh good! Those helpful beavers are swimming out to save him!
Carl Carlson,Oh no! They're biting him! And stealing his pants!
Waylon Smithers,Good lord! He'll be sucked into the turbine!

Marge Simpson,What are you talking about?
Ned Flanders,You know...
Ned Flanders,Homer's passing...away.
Ned Flanders,Into death.
Marge Simpson,What?!
Mona Simpson,"Abe, isn't Homer cute?"
Marge Simpson,"That's ridiculous. Homer's not dead, he's right out back in the hammock."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, Marge. Of course Homer's alive. He's alive in all our hearts."
Maude Flanders,"Yes, Marge, I can see him."
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, everybody."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Marge, I'm going to give you the card of our juvenile counselor..."
Marge Simpson,A tombstone?!
Patty Bouvier,"It came with the burial plot. But that's not important. The important thing is, Homer's dead."
Selma Bouvier,We've been saving for this since your wedding day.
Marge Simpson,"Get out of here, you ghouls!"
Marge Simpson,"Oy, yoy yoy yoy yoy."
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Uh, excuse me, sir, I think there's been a mistake."
Line Man,"Oh, no mistake. Your electricity is in the name of Homer J. Simpson, deceased. The juice stays off until you get a job or a generator. Oh, and uh, my deepest sympathies."
Marge Simpson,Homer?
Homer Simpson,That's m'name.
Marge Simpson,"When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me ""no."" You go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out."
Lisa Simpson,Mom! Dad! Bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!
Bart Simpson,Whuth va hell ith going on heah?!

Homer Simpson,"Listen here. My name is Homer J. Simpson. You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not. Now I want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."
County Clerk,"Okay, Mr. Simpson, I'll just make the change here ...and you're all set."
Homer Simpson,"I don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. What do you have in that secret government file, anyway? I have a right to read it."
County Clerk,You sure do.
Homer Simpson,"""Wife: Marjorie. Children: Bartholomew, Lisa..."" Aha! See, this thing is all screwed up. Who the heck is ""Margaret"" Simpson?"
County Clerk,"Uh, your youngest daughter."
Lisa Simpson,"This is so weird. It's like something out of Dickens or ""Melrose Place."""
Homer Simpson,"""Youngest daughter..."" Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid."
Homer Simpson,You see that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave. My Dad points it out every time we drive by.
County Clerk,"Mr. Simpson, maybe you should actually go up there."

Homer Simpson,"Oh, Mom. I'm sorry I never come to see you. I'm just not a cemetery person."
Homer Simpson,Here lies... Walt Whitman?!!
Homer Simpson,"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson."""
Homer Simpson,Why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!
Woman,"You awful, awful man. Get out of my son's grave."

Homer Simpson,Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd. I can't believe you're here. Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.
Mona Simpson,"Oh, my poor baby. You must have been so upset... but I suppose Abe has his reasons."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah. Well, where have you been all this time?"
Mona Simpson,"Oh, it's a very complicated story. Let's just enjoy this moment."
Homer Simpson,"Mom, there's something you should know about me. I almost always spoil the moment."
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry.
Mona Simpson,"That's okay, darling. It wasn't your fault."

Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody, I've got a big surprise for you! Presenting: my mother!"
Mona Simpson,Hello.
Bart Simpson,"Where have you been, Granny? Did they freeze you or something?"
Mona Simpson,"Oh, my, such clever grandchildren. So full of questions and bright, shiny eyes."
Marge Simpson,I don't know what to say. I finally have a mother-in-law. No more living vicariously through my girlfriends!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... You owe me twenty-two thousand dollars."
Homer Simpson,I'll Kwaanza you!
Mona Simpson,"Homer, don't be so hard on little... What is his name?"
Homer Simpson,This is my room. This is my dresser. It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.
Mona Simpson,"Oh, yes. Right in the drawers."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,You remembered.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've missed moments like this... Mom."
Mona Simpson,"I saw all your awards, Lisa. They're mighty impressive."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I just keep them out to bug Bart."
Mona Simpson,"Don't be bashful. When I was your age, kids made fun of me because I read at the 9th grade level."
Lisa Simpson,"Me, too!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Mom, lookit me! Look at what I can do!"
Mona Simpson,"I see you, Homer. That's very nice. Although I hardly consider ""A Separate Peace"" the 9th grade level."
Lisa Simpson,More like pre-school.
Mona Simpson,I hate John Knowles.
Lisa Simpson,"Me, too."
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Mo-om! You're not looking!
Mona Simpson,"You know, Lisa, I feel like I have an instant rapport with you."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, you didn't dumb it down! You said ""rapport!"""
Mona Simpson,Gotta run... Gramma stuff.
Lisa Simpson,There. Now no one should be able to hear us.
Bart Simpson,What?
Lisa Simpson,"All right, we don't need the dryer."
Bart Simpson,What?
Lisa Simpson,"Just shut up and listen. There's something fishy about Grandma. Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I don't trust her either. When I was going through her purse, look what I found."
Lisa Simpson,"Mona Simpson, Mona Stevens, Martha Stewart, Penelope Olsen, Muddy Mae Suggins..."
Lisa Simpson,These are the calling cards of a con artist.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back! I never realized how much I missed her.
Marge Simpson,She's nice.
Homer Simpson,But?
Marge Simpson,I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. You could get hurt again.
Homer Simpson,"First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason."
Marge Simpson,Which was?
Homer Simpson,I 'unno. I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie. C'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. I'm sure you were a wonderful son."
Homer Simpson,Then why did she leave me?
Marge Simpson,Let's find out.
Marge Simpson,"Mother Simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past."
Mona Simpson,"Can't reminisce, sleeping."
Bart Simpson,"Spill it, Muddy Mae, or we're calling the cops!"
Mona Simpson,Please don't.
Lisa Simpson,"All right, then we'll call your husband: Grampa."
Mona Simpson,Noooo! I'll talk. I'll tell you everything. I've wanted to tell you. It all started in the '60s...
Mona Simpson,"Oh, my little Homie-bear! Time for bed."
Mona Simpson,"GOOEY, GOOEY, RICH AND CHEWY INSIDE / GOLDEN, FLAKY, TENDER CAKE-Y OUTSIDE / WRAP THE INSIDE IN THE OUTSIDE / IS IT GOOD?"
Mona Simpson,It's the...
Grampa Simpson,"Probably. I'm trying to watch the Super Bowl. If people don't support this thing, it might not make it."
Howard Cosell,"Joe Willie Namath, swaggering off the field, his sideburns an apogee of sculpted sartorium. The foppish follicles pioneered by Ambrose Burnside. Appomattox, 1865..."
Mona Simpson,"His wild, untamed facial hair revealed a new world of rebellion, of change. A world where doors were open for women like me. But Abe was stuck in his button-down plastic-fantastic Madison Avenue scene."
Grampa Simpson,"Look at them sideburns. He looks like a girl. Now Johnny Unitas, there's a haircut you can set your watch to."
Marge Simpson,"So, Mother Simpson, where did your new-found sense of irresponsibility take you?"
Mona Simpson,I soon found people who shared my views at the State College...
,
Protestors,"Anthrax, gangrene, swimmer's ear! / Get your germ lab out of here!"
Mona Simpson,How could I not become a radical when we were fighting a force of pure evil?
Protestors,Hey! Hey! Mr. Burns! / Enough already with the germs!
C. Montgomery Burns,Their flower power is no match for my glower power.
C. Montgomery Burns,
Student Wiggum,"That's some nice glowering, Mr. B."
,
Mona Simpson,We'd met the enemy and it was Montgomery Burns. Drastic action had to be taken to stop his war machine.
Mona Simpson,"I put Homer to bed, Abe. And now I'm going out. It could be a late night. I'm meeting my destiny."
Grampa Simpson,So long.
,
Dennis Hopper,"When this baby goes off, Burns' lab is gonna be history, man. Germ history. Oh, man, I got the munchies."
Student Wiggum,No!... No! Wait a minute. Bronchial tubes clearing... Asthma disappearing! Acne remains. But asthma disappearing!
C. Montgomery Burns,My germs! My precious germs! They never harmed a soul! They never even had a chance! Whoever did this will never get past me!
Mona Simpson,You poor man. Let me help you up.
Sideshow Bob,"Diiieeee, Krusty!! Diii--"
C. Montgomery Burns,You just made a very big mistake. You'll spend the rest of your life in pris--
Student Wiggum,My asthma's gone! Listen to me breathe!
Mona Simpson,"From that moment on, my life as I knew it was over."
,
Kent Brockman,Only one member of the Springfield Seven was identified.
Kent Brockman,"She's been described as a woman in her early thirties, yellow complexion, and may be extremely helpful. For channel six news, I'm Kenny Brockelstein."
Mona Simpson,Homer?
Mona Simpson,"I'll miss you, Homer."
,
Homer Simpson,I thought I dreamed that kiss.
Marge Simpson,"I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom. You had to leave to protect your family."
Lisa Simpson,How did you survive?
Mona Simpson,"Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground. Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes. I proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook. And I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership."
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. There's one thing I don't understand. In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?"
Mona Simpson,But I did. I sent you a care package every week.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
Mona Simpson,But I did! I really did! I'll prove it to you.
,
Homer Simpson,Any undelivered mail for Homer J. Simpson?
Postal Clerk,"No. Oh, wait. This."
Homer Simpson,Hey!
Postal Clerk,That's what happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aero-mail. Am I too late for the 4:30 auto-gyro?"
Postal Clerk #2,I better look in the manual.
C. Montgomery Burns,Ach. The ignorance.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait a minute, I know that woman. But from when and in what capacity?"
C. Montgomery Burns,It's her! At last!
Postal Clerk #2,"This book must be out of date. I don't see Prussia, Siam, or Auto-Gyro."
C. Montgomery Burns,Keep looking.
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Fbi Agent #1,Are you sure this is the woman you saw in the post office?
C. Montgomery Burns,Absolutely. Who could forget such a monstrous visage?
C. Montgomery Burns,She has the sloping brow and cranial bumpage of the career criminal.
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, sir, phrenology was dismissed as quackery 160 years ago."
C. Montgomery Burns,Of course you'd say that...
C. Montgomery Burns,You have the brain-pan of a stagecoach tilter.
Fbi Agent #2,At any rate... The FBI will track down this mystery woman and put her behind bars.
Fbi Agent #2,"How does it happen, Joe?"
Fbi Agent #1,How does what happen?
Fbi Agent #2,How does a sweet young lady mortgage her future for a bunch of scraggly ideals and greasy-haired promises?
Fbi Agent #1,Maybe she thought the war in Southeast Asia was so immoral her end justified the means.
Fbi Agent #2,"Gee, Joe. You haven't been the same since your son went crazy in Vietnam."
Fbi Agent #1,It's a pain that never ends.
,
Mona Simpson,HOW MANY ROADS MUST A MAN WALK DOWN / BEFORE YOU CAN CALL HIM A MAN?
Homer Simpson,Seven!
Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad, it's a rhetorical question."
Homer Simpson,"Rhetorical, eh? Eight."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, do you even know what ""rhetorical"" means?"
Homer Simpson,"Do I know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
Bart Simpson,"Quick Gramma, hide!"
Grampa Simpson,"No door is gonna keep me from my meddlin'! Stand up straight, Bart."
Mona Simpson,Abe?
Grampa Simpson,What the?! Now here's a piece of bad news.
Mona Simpson,"Oh, Abe... You've aged terribly."
Grampa Simpson,What do you expect? You left me to raise the boy on my own...
Mona Simpson,I had to leave! But you didn't have to tell Homer I was dead.
Grampa Simpson,"It was either that or tell him his mother was a wanted criminal! You were a rotten wife and I'll never, ever forgive you. Can we have sex? Please?"
Mona Simpson,"Oh, Abe."
Grampa Simpson,"Well, I tried. What's for supper?"
,
Cabbie,"I mighta seen her. It's hard to tell from this old picture, you know."
Fbi Agent #2,"Well, according to our computer aging program, she should look abouuut..."
Fbi Agent #2,Twenty-five years older.
Cabbie,"Yeah, I seen her! That is to say, I saw her."
,
Bart Simpson,"Look at me, Gramma, I'm a hippie! Peace, man! Groovy! Bomb VIetnam! Four more years! Up with people!"
Lisa Simpson,"You know, Gramma, I used to think maybe I was adopted. I couldn't understand how I fit into this family. Now that I met you, I suddenly make a lot of sense."
Mona Simpson,"Oh, I'm glad to see the spirit of the '60s is still alive in you kids."
,
Grave-digger,"Yep, I saw her. That is to say I seen her. She seemed like a nice lady."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, that ""nice lady"" set the cause of biological warfare back thirty years."
Waylon Smithers,We're only now finally caught up.
Grave-digger,"Two more ladies come by earlier that day. One was real purty. T'other, sorta plain."
,
Fbi Agent #1,"Ma'am, we're going to need your assistance in locating this individual."
Selma Bouvier,"Oh, you're fresh."
Selma Bouvier,Don't you want to play good cop/bad cop?
Fbi Agent #1,"Ma'am, we're all good cops."
Selma Bouvier,I had no intention of playing the good cop.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, we know you bought the tombstone. We know the fugitive visited that tombstone. Whose tombstone was it?!"
Patty Bouvier,Just lift up your coffee cups and see.
Waylon Smithers,Good lord!
Chief Wiggum,Put out an APB on a Uosdwis R. Dewoh. Better start with Greektown.
Fbi Agent #1,"That's Homer J. Simpson, Chief. You're reading it upside down."
Chief Wiggum,"Ahh, cancel the APB. But bring back some of them gyros ."
Fbi Agent #1,"Uh, Chief. You're talking into your wallet."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to Springfield?"
Homer Simpson,You could live with Grampa again.
Bart Simpson,
,
Mona Simpson,"You know, Lisa, it might be nice to rest for a while."
Homer Simpson,"Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I've been waiting twenty-five years for this moment.
Waylon Smithers,"I'm sorry, sir. I must have taped over that."
Fbi Agent #1,Freeze! FBI! The jig is up!
Grampa Simpson,"All right, I admit it! I am the Lindbergh baby. Whaa whaa. Goo goo. I miss my fly-fly da-da."
Fbi Agent #1,"Are you trying to stall us, or are you just senile?"
Grampa Simpson,"A little from column A, a little from column B."
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, she's gone!"
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Mona Simpson,"We made it, Homer!"
Homer Simpson,"It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. But who are you, and why did you tip us off?"
Caller,"well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid of the asthma that was keeping me out of the Academy."
Homer Simpson,Thanks.
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose through the ranks of the Springfield Police to become Chief Clancy Wig --"
Homer Simpson,Yak yak yak yak yak.
,
Mona Simpson,"Well, there's my ride. The underground awaits."
Homer Simpson,At least this time I'm awake for your goodbye.
Sideshow Bob,Oh.
Mona Simpson,"Oh, Homer. Remember, whatever happens, you have a mother, and she's truly proud of you."
Homer Simpson,
Van Driver,"Oh, hurry up, man. This electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left."
Homer Simpson,Don't forget me.
Mona Simpson,"Don't worry, Homer. You'll always be a part of me."
Mona Simpson,
Krusty the Clown,"I'd like to thank everybody who contributed to Krusty's Kanned Food Drive. Your generous donations have made this our slipperiest, slimiest Slobstacle Course ever!"
Krusty the Clown,"Our contestants will drop out of my nose and blurp into a tub of refried beans. From there, they'll stumble down a sluice of rich, eggy bearnaise sauce. How can we afford it? It's rancid!"
Sideshow Mel,
Krusty the Clown,"And at the finish line -- a scrumptious parfait of pudding, pickle brine and detergent, where a writhing pile of kids will grope blindly for hot dogs."
Sideshow Mel,"Krusty, please, it burns."
,
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, just think, Lis, that's our pickle brine burning Sideshow Mel."
Homer Simpson,That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big. Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob?
Lisa Simpson,"Don't you remember, dad?"
Lisa Simpson,He framed Krusty. He tried to kill Aunt Selma. He rigged an election.
Bart Simpson,And he tried to murder me.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah... But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter. I wonder what he's doing now?"
,
Sideshow Bob,"Ahh, Westminster Abbey. Edward the Confessor himself could not have done better. Now to set the clocks to Greenwich Mean Time."
Sideshow Bob,My dear Abbey!
,
Krusty the Clown,THIS IS THE WAY WE MOP THE FLOOR / MOP THE FLOOR / MOP THE FLOOR / THIS IS THE WAY WE MOP THE FLOOR / ETC.
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, must you bray night and day at that infernal television?"
Prisoner #1,"Oh, look who's talking!"
Prisoner #2,"Yeah, Bob! You used to be on this show!"
Sideshow Bob,"Don't remind me! My foolish capering destroyed more young minds than syphilis and pinball combined! Oh, how I loathe that box. That omnidirectional sludge pump, droning and burping its--"
Enraged Prisoner,"Look here, that's enough, now! I own 60% of that network!"
Chief Wiggum,"Alright, break it up, boys. It's time for work detail."
Enraged Prisoner,I suppose you don't like tabloid newspapers either.
,
Sideshow Bob,"There, that's the last condom wrapper."
Sideshow Bob,I renew my objection to this pointless endeavor. Informally now and by affidavit later... time permitting.
Chief Wiggum,Shut yer word-hole! We gotta get this place clean for the air show.
Sideshow Bob,"Air show? Buzzcut Alabamians spewing colored smoke from their whiz-jets to the strains of ""Rock You Like A Hurricane""? What kind of country-fried rube is still impressed by that?"
Lisa Simpson,Wow! / Air show! / Cool! /
Marge Simpson,Yeah.
Lisa Simpson,"I wanna meet the first female Stealth bomber pilot. During the Gulf War she destroyed seventy mosques and her name is Lisa, too!"
Bart Simpson,I wanna see some birds get sucked into the engines! Rare ones!
Marge Simpson,"This year, I'm making earplugs out of biscuit dough!"
Marge Simpson,They're ready.
,
Sideshow Bob,So weary.
Teenage Girl,"Grandma, this is my friend Craig."
Tv Audience,
GRANDMA,Friend? You mean you two aren't knockin' boots?!
Tv Audience,
GRANDMA,"Ever do the backseat mambo, Craigy?"
Sideshow Bob,I know that voice. TV's bottomless chum-bucket has claimed Vanessa Redgrave.
GRANDMA,Now I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!
GRANDMA,Yeeeee-haw!
Sideshow Bob,"Farewell, dear 'Nessa."
,
Chief Wiggum,"Hey you, the state's not paying you five cents an hour to stand around. Now get busy."
Marge Simpson,Sweet dreams.
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, I'll get busy. I'll get very busy indeed."
Chief Wiggum,"You still got it, Bob."
Bart Simpson,"Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun."
AIRMAN AT THE GATE,I have three medals for this.
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, where is Sideshow Bob and that guy who eats people and takes their faces?"
Very Normal Prisoner,"I'm right here, Chief!"
Chief Wiggum,Oh. Then where's Sideshow Bob?
Another Prisoner,"Uh, he ran off."
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, great. Well... if anyone asks, uh, I beat him to death, okay?"
Lou,Right.
Airman Tour Guide,"At this point in time, I would like to direct your attention to the particular air vehicle next to which I am currently standing. The Harrier jet is one of our more dollar-intensive ordnance delivery vectors."
Marge Simpson,Five tires?! Am I seeing things?
Airman Tour Guide,"...And although it looks complicated, it is so well-designed even a child could fly it."
Lisa Simpson,Can I fly it?
Airman Tour Guide,Of course you can not.

Homer Simpson,Free Duff! Viva life!

Milhouse Van Houten,"Take that, Mom! Take that, Dad! Send me to a psychiatrist will you?! Take that, Dr. Sally Waxler!!"
,
Aide,"Uh, Colonel, they're expecting you at the podium in ten minutes."
Colonel,
Sideshow Bob,Hmmmm.
Colonel,What in the world according to Garp?! Those are my dress towels!
Colonel,Who's in my private washroom? McGuckett? Let me in!
Sideshow Bob,The door already is closed.
Colonel,"What?! This is Colonel Leslie ""Hap"" Hapablap. If you don't open that door, I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a snot party!"
,
Sideshow Bob,You say you're in the military?
Colonel,"Sweet Enola Gay! Son, I'm gonna come in there and corpse you up!"
Colonel,Corpse you up and mail you to Momma!!
Colonel,"Well, where'd he go? Got my knuckles all lined up for nothin'. Sorry, ladies."
,
Bart Simpson,Look at that hunk o' junk.
Grampa Simpson,"You're ignorant! That's the Wright Brothers' Plane! At Kitty Hawk in 1903, Charles Lindbergh flew it fifteen miles on a thimble full of corn oil. Single-handedly won us the Civil War, it did."
Bart Simpson,So how do you know so much about American history?
Grampa Simpson,"I pieced it together, mostly from sugar packets."
M.P.,Authorization code?
Sideshow Bob,"Code?! Son, this is Colonel Hapablap. That fool McGuckett sprayed runway foam all over Chuck Yeager's Acura. Now get down there with a chammy. Triple-time!"
M.P.,"But, Colonel, I'm under strict orders to--"
Sideshow Bob,"Sweet Enola Gay, son! Get moving or I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a sn-- ""snot party."""
M.P.,"Sir! Right away, Sir!"
,
Homer Simpson,"They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes."
Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe my headache will go away once the show starts."
Colonel,"Ladies and gentlemen, what a day for an air show. Not a cloud in the sky!"
,
Sideshow Bob,"Except, perhaps, a mushroom cloud..."
Sideshow Bob,
Colonel,"""To slip the surly bonds of Earth / And touch the face of God."" ""To Fly"" -- The dream of man and flightless bird alike. And now, hold on tight as we blast through the thrilling highlights of aviation history!"
Colonel,"Say, did somebody say box-kites?"
Bart Simpson,No!
ENTIRE AUDIENCE,
Martin Prince,The common box-kite was originally used as a means of drying wet string...

,
Loudspeaker,'CAUSE WE CAN FLYYYYYYY / 'CAUSE WE CAN FLYYYYY-YYYY!
Marge Simpson,Do they have to play that rock music?! Every note is pounding into my skull!
,
,
Colonel,Anybody out there feel the need for speed?
Lisa Simpson,Yay!
Marge Simpson,Yay.
Colonel,Then get ready for the pride of the United States Air Force -- the British-made Harrier Jump Jet!
Lisa Simpson,Da-ad! Why aren't you looking?
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?"
Homer Simpson,"Oo, look, it's Maggie!"
Homer Simpson,Uh... Maggie?
Bart Simpson,Sideshow Bob!
Spectators,
Sideshow Bob,"Hello, Springfield. Sorry to divert your attention from all the big noises and shiny things, but something's been troubling me lately: television. Wouldn't our lives be so much richer if television were done away with?"
Moe Szyslak,What?!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Surely he's not talking about VH-1!
Sideshow Bob,"Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. Thus, I submit to you: we abolish television. Permanently."
Homer Simpson,"Go back to Massachusetts, pinko!"
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, and one more thing, I've stolen a nuclear weapon. If you do not rid this city of television within two hours, I will detonate it. Farewell."
Sideshow Bob,"By the way, I'm aware of the irony of appearing on TV in order to decry it, so don't bother pointing that out."
Marge Simpson,"Kids, everything's going to be okay! Don't panic! Just don't panic!"
Lisa Simpson,"Mom! Mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off!"
Marge Simpson,We can always get more shoes! MoveMoveMove!
Airman At Gate,Stamp your hand for re-entry!
Bart Simpson,Cool! I want to be around when those guns start going off!
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, no!"
Marge Simpson,Wait!! Wait! My children are in there!
Sentry,"You must be very proud, Ma'am."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks, Mom."
Mayor Joe Quimby,Our city will not negotiate with terrorists! Is there a city nearby that will?
,
Grampa Simpson,This elevator only goes to the basement. And someone made an awful mess down there!
Soldier #1,Watch out! He's got his probe!
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Bart! Bart! What are you doing?! We've got to get out of here!
Bart Simpson,Target sighted. Launching air-to-nerd missile!
Lisa Simpson,"Ow! C'mon, Mom and Dad are waiting!"
Colonel,"Bob is not here! We have searched every square inch of this base, and all we have found is porno, porno, porno!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,We only have twenty minutes left. Send in the esteemed representatives of television.
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, hey! Now this is my kind of meeting!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Gentlemen, it's time we face up to the un-face-up-to-able. We must sacrifice television in order to save the lives of our townspeople."
Krusty the Clown,"Whoa, whoa, hoa, hoa, let's not go nuts. Would it really be worth living in a world without television? I think the survivors would envy the dead."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"I appreciate your passion on behalf of your medium, but I'm afraid we're out of options. Television must go. May God have mercy on our souls."
Kent Brockman,"...And as my final newscast draws to a close, I'm reminded of a few of the events that brought me closer to you: the collapse of the Soviet Union, premium ice cream price wars, dogs that were mistakenly issued major credit cards and others who weren't so lucky. And so, farewell."
Kent Brockman,"Um, and, uh, don't forget to look for my new column in PC World magazine."
,
Bumblebee Man,"Muchos gracias, amigos, por todas las memorias... Y super-gracias a Goya!"
,
Sideshow Bob,"Success! They're giving in! Blast, I should've made more demands. Some decent local marmalade, for one. Oh, well, next time."
,
Airman In Tank,"Ooo, sorry... We don't normally drive these in the Air Force."
Krusty the Clown,"Agh! Not my Extendo-Glove! Oh, they haven't made those since the war! Not... oh, not my Paris backdrop! How'm I gonna make fun of the Frogs?"
Krusty the Clown,"Wait. If I could only stay on the air, I'd have a hundred percent of the audience. Think of the ratings."
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so we can't go over the fence."
Marge Simpson,I feel so helpless. What if something happens to them?
Homer Simpson,"I'm sure they're fine, honey."
Marge Simpson,"Well, at least they're wearing clean underwear."
Bart Simpson,"Free 'n' easy, Lis. Ahh. There's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort."
Lisa Simpson,"Huh? Hurry up, Mom and Dad are probably worried sick."
Colonel,You know what really frosts my Kelvinator? That fruitcup's probably still laughing at us from his damn hidey-hole.
Aide,"I'd rather take an order from Bill Clinton than hear that guy's snooty, high-toned voice again, Sir."
Lisa Simpson,"High-toned voice. Bart, that's it. I know where Sideshow Bob is hiding."
Lisa Simpson,"When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. And what makes your voice high?"
Bart Simpson,"Tight, binding underwear?"
Lisa Simpson,Helium. Sideshow Bob is in the Duff Blimp!
,
Sideshow Bob,"All Springfield trembles before the might of Sideshow Bob! Blasted helium. Shoo, shoo, shoo. Ahh, that's better."
Sideshow Bob,Gone... gone too... fabulous... marvelous...
Recorded Announcer,This is the Emergency Broadcast System. Stand by for an urgent bulletin.
Krusty the Clown,Hey hey!
Krusty the Clown,"Krusty the Klown is back on the air! Eight -- no, no, twelve hours a day! The only game in town!"
Sideshow Bob,Krusty?!! But how?!
Krusty the Clown,Comin' at ya live from the Civil Defense Shack in the remote Alkali Flats of the Springfield Badlands!
,
Krusty the Clown,"I'll be beamin' out eleven watts of wackiness -- hour after hour of unscripted, unrehearsed comedy! Featuring... um... you know... uh..."
,
Krusty the Clown,Let's get busy!
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, my utopia lies in ruins! How naive of me to think a mere atom bomb could fell the chattering cyclops."
Lisa Simpson,
Sideshow Bob,"Well, at least I'll have my revenge..."
Bart Simpson,"Bob, no!!"
Lisa Simpson,Don't you see? That would be taking the easy way out --
Sideshow Bob,I agree.
,
Sideshow Bob,"""Best before November 1959."" Dammit, Bob, there were plenty of brand new bombs, but you had to go for that retro Fifties charm."
Lisa Simpson,
Sideshow Bob,"Well, if it isn't my arch-nemesis Bart Simpson and his sister Lisa, to whom I'm fairly indifferent."
Bart Simpson,So Krusty double-crossed you. But your basic plan was pure genius. Where do you get your ideas?
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, please, let's not embarrass us both with that hoary old ""stall the villain with flattery"" scheme."
Bart Simpson,I should've known you were too smart to fall for that.
Sideshow Bob,Really? What type of smart? Book smart? Because there are a lot of people who are book smart. But it takes a very special type of genius to--
Chief Wiggum,"Alright, Bob, it's over! Come out with your hands up!"
Sideshow Bob,No! How did they find me?!
Lisa Simpson,He's getting away!
,
Colonel,"Aw, not the Harrier! We've got a war tomorrow."
Sideshow Bob,God bless the idiot-proof Air Force.
Airman With Pistol,They're gone!
Colonel,"Hell, not the Wright Brothers' Plane! The Smithsonian's gonna have my ass on a platter!"

Bart Simpson,Daaadd! Hellllp!
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hang on, boy! Daddy's comin' to save ya!"
Homer Simpson,
Chief Wiggum,"Gotcha, ya TV-hatin' mutant!"
Marge Simpson,Sleep tight.
Lisa Simpson,Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hide-out and I got a secret message to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic blast but I'm okay now!
Homer Simpson,"Well, I wrecked the gate but you don't hear me bragging. Now let's roll."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Ah, for the days when aviation was a gentlemen's pursuit. Back before every Joe Sweatsock could wedge himself behind a lunch tray and jet off to Raleigh-Durham."
Bart Simpson,"Are you getting a lot of bugs in your mouth, too?"
Sideshow Bob,Yes.
,
,
Pilot,Prepare to engage enemy.
Pilot,Bogie's airspeed not sufficient for intercept. Suggest we get out and walk.
Homer Simpson,"Jump, boy! I gotcha!"
Bart Simpson,I'm comin'!
Homer Simpson,"Now you, boy!"
Bart Simpson,"You can't escape, Bob! If the tennis rackets don't get you, the pool skimmers will."
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, I never planned to escape. You see, this is a kamikaze mission. You and I are going to kill Krusty the clown."
Bart Simpson,

Krusty the Clown,"Kids, Itchy and Scratchy can't be here today, but instead, we've got the next best thing..."
Krusty the Clown,It's the Sting-y and Battery Show! THEY BITE / AND LIGHT / AND BITE AND LIGHT AND BITE! BITE BITE BITE... YADDA YADDA YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT...
Krusty the Clown,Uh-oh.

Bart Simpson,"But you can't kill Krusty. He made you what you are. Without him, you wouldn't even be called Sideshow."
Sideshow Bob,
,
Krusty the Clown,"Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh-heh, heh-heh-- What the hell is that, a lawnmower?"
Krusty the Clown,Yaaaah!!
Bart Simpson,"Get out of the way, Krusty!"
Krusty the Clown,What is the freakin' holdup?
Lisa Simpson,"Goodnight, Mom."
Colonel,"What is your major malfunction, Sideshow Bob?!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my little sugar-bug... I'm so glad you're safe..."
Bart Simpson,Mo-om! You're embarrassing me in front of the Army guys.
Sideshow Bob,How ironic. My crusade against television has come to an end so formulaic it could've spewed from the Powerbook of the laziest Hollywood hack...
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, everybody! I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza!"
Lisa Simpson,Here we go again!
Marge Simpson,...go again.
Announcer,"Live from the Springfield Civic Auditorium, it's ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular!"""
Audience,
,
Troy McClure,"Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such Fox Network specials as ""Alien Nose-Job"" and ""Five Fabulous Weeks of the Chevy Chase Show."""
Troy McClure,Tonight we're here to honor America's favorite non-prehistoric cartoon family. You'll see long-lost footage...never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes...old favorites you can't see in syndication...
Troy McClure,"So join me, won't you, for ""The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular!"""
Troy McClure,"""The Simpsons"" began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt Groening,...the already-famous creator of such comics as ""Damnation,"" ""Johnny Reb,"" and ""True Murder Stories""."
Troy McClure,"In nineteen eithty-seven, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L. Brooks...and Sam Simon."
Troy McClure,"And what better place to premier their creation than on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" -- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers. On April 19th, 1987, America first met... the Simpsons."
Homer Simpson,"Well, goodnight, son."
Bart Simpson,"Um, Dad..."
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Bart Simpson,"What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible?"
Homer Simpson,Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.
Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Good night, son."
Marge Simpson,"Goodnight, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"I will, Mom."
Marge Simpson,Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Lisa Simpson,Bedbugs?
Marge Simpson,"ROCKABYE BABY IN THE TREE TOP / WHEN THE WIND BLOWS / THE CRADLE WILL ROCK / WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS / THE CRADLE WILL FALL / AND DOWN WILL COME BABY, CRADLE AND ALL."
Maggie Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Sweet dreams.
Homer Simpson,We may be the best parents in the world.
Marge Simpson,"Goodnight, dear."
Homer Simpson,Goodnight.
Maggie Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"All right, climb in."
Homer Simpson,There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.
Troy McClure,"They haven't changed a bit, have they? As the weeks went on, so did the cartoons!"
Marge Simpson,Fresh chocolate chip cookies.
Marge Simpson,"Don't touch those yet. They're very, very hot."
Bart Simpson,Aha! No one's around. The perfect crime.
Bart Simpson,Yeow!
Homer Simpson,Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies?
Marge Simpson,They're all gone. The whole batch.
Homer Simpson,Somebody ate those cookies.
Marge Simpson,"Did you eat the cookies, Maggie."
Homer Simpson,I think she's trying to tell us something.
Marge Simpson,Go on Maggie.
Homer Simpson,"Go on, Maggie. Go. Go."
Bart Simpson,There's no perfect crime.
Bart Simpson,I've got a great idea. Let's play Space Patrol.
Lisa Simpson,I'll be Lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
Bart Simpson,"Maggie can be Maggina, her spunky sidekick."
Lisa Simpson,"...and you'll be Bartron, the evil robot from Mars, gone berserk."
Lisa Simpson,"Do I understand you correctly, Bartron? Do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand?"
Bart Simpson,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Yes!
Lisa Simpson,"I will do it, Bartron. Who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed?"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh no. Inside, the evil Bartron is a horrible mutant boy."
Lisa Simpson,"We'll be safe here till Mom and Dad, the evil overlords gets home."
Troy McClure,"As wacky as those kids were, they were no match for Captain Wacky -- later"
Troy McClure,"renamed ""Homer."""
Homer Simpson,Wake up everybody! It's World War Three!
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Quick, down to the fallout shelter! The bombs are dropping!"
Homer Simpson,"Eighteen seconds, hmph. If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. Say, you're all shivering. Are you cold or what?"
Homer Simpson,"Bart! Bart! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy!"
Bart Simpson,Gotta hide.
Homer Simpson,"Bart! Where are ya, boy."
Bart Simpson,Oops.
Homer Simpson,Aha!
Homer Simpson,"There you go. Now that's not so bad, is it?"
Bart Simpson,Ahhhh. Welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer Bart Simpson.
Bart Simpson,"Come with Bart as he dive into the briny deep, searching for the wily and elusive wash cloth. Suddenly, without warning, the great Bart get more than he bargain for."
Bart Simpson,Help! Help!
Bart Simpson,"Clean as a whistle, Homer!"
Troy McClure,"Maybe the drawings were a little crude, but all the characters were there: Itchy & Scratchy...Grampa Simpson...and Krusty the Klown!"
Troy McClure,"When we return: more classic moments and, for the first time on TV, our private reel of Simpsons outtakes -- including the alternate endings to ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"""
Announcer,"In the opening credits, what does the cash register say when Maggie is scanned?"
Announcer,"It says... ""N.R.A. Forever!"" Just one of the hundreds of radical right-wing messages inserted into every show by creator Matt Groening."
Matt Groening,Get outta my office!!
Lee Carvallo,"Don't do it, son. How's that game gonna help your putting?"
Troy McClure,"Over the six years ""The Simpsons"" has been on the air, we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show. Tonight we'll answer some of your questions. Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago writes, ""I think Homer gets stupider every year."" That's not a question, Professor. But we'll let the viewers judge for themselves."
Homer Simpson,Hello. My name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me.
Postal Worker,"Okay, Mr. Burns. Uh, what's your first name?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
Marge Simpson,Well Homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
Homer Simpson,"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
Marge Simpson,"Well, duh."
Homer Simpson,Yabba dabba doo!
Homer Simpson,"SIMPSON, HOMER SIMPSON / HE'S THE GREATEST GUY IN HISTORY / FROM THE TOWN OF SPRINGFIELD / HE'S ABOUT TO HIT A CHESTNUT TREE"
Homer Simpson,"Hey guys, look what I smuggled aboard."
BUZZ,"Homer, no!"
Race,They'll clog the instruments!
BUZZ,"Careful, they're ruffled!"
Homer Simpson,I'll take care of this.
Homer Simpson,Ants!
Ants,
Ant #1,SUBTITLE: PROTECT THE QUEEN!
Ant #2,SUBTITLE: WHICH ONE'S THE QUEEN?
Ant #3,SUBTITLE: I'M THE QUEEN.
Ant #4,SUBTITLE: NO YOU'RE NOT.
Ants,
Homer Simpson,"...""No TV and No Beer Make Homer..."" something, something."
Marge Simpson,Go crazy?
Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do.
Troy McClure,"Doctor Linus Irvin of the Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute writes, ""How does Matt Groening find the time to write and draw an entire 'Simpsons' episode every week?"" For the answer to this, we went straight to the source."
,
Troy McClure,"Of course, what Matt meant to say -- according to his attorneys -- is that he couldn't possibly do it alone. And he insisted that we make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who makes ""The Simpsons"" possible."
Troy McClure,"Ambassador Henry Mwabwetumba of the Ivory Coast writes, ""What is the real deal with Mr. Burns' assistant, Smithers? You know what I'm talking about."" Of course we do."
Waylon Smithers,...the preparations for your birthday have begun.
C. Montgomery Burns,I won't get what I really want
Waylon Smithers,No one does.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers."
Waylon Smithers,
Waylon Smithers,"People like dogs, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh... if you did it, sir?...I'll - uh -print you out a copy."
Lisa Simpson,Thanks.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, Smithers. You're quite good at turning me on."
Waylon Smithers,"Um, you probably should ignore that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?"
Troy McClure,"As you can see, the ""real deal"" with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant."
Troy McClure,"He's in his early 40's, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing! We'll be right back."
Announcer,"Which popular ""Simpsons"" characters have died in the past year?"
Announcer,"If you said Bleeding Gums Murphy and Dr. Marvin Monroe, you are wrong. They were never popular."
,
Troy McClure,"Right about now you're probably saying ""Troy, I've seen every SimpsonS episode. You can't show me anything new"". You've got some attitude, mister. Besides, you're wrong! Because sometimes episodes run long and certain scenes never get aired. So fire up your VCR, because here for the first time ever are the cut-out classics."
Bart Simpson,Oh. A soiled wig.
Troy McClure,"When Krusty the Klown got cancelled, he tried everything to stay on the air. Here's what you didn't see..."
Kids,
Krusty the Clown,"If you watch my show, I will send you this book featuring me in a variety of sexually explicit positions."
Krusty the Clown,It's not me! I used a stunt butt.
Network Executive #1,"Krusty, we're from the network. We have some bad news. I'm afraid your show's been cancelled."
Krusty the Clown,I thought this would happen. I just hope you replace me with something as educational and uplifting as I've tried to be.
Network Executive #2,"Actually, it's a hemorrhoid infomercial starring Claude Akins."
Krusty the Clown,"Can I play Hemorrhoid Sufferer #1? Ooh... ooh, that hurts. Is there no relief?"
Network Executive #1,I don't think so.
Krusty the Clown,"Well, how about one of the ""after"" guys? Ah... Ah, that's better. I can ride a bike again"
Network Executive #1,Sorry.
Krusty the Clown,
Troy McClure,"When Springfield legalized gambling, Homer became a blackjack dealer... and comedy was in the cards!"
Troy McClure,"Earlier this year, Homer's long-lost mother returned, and so did a long-lost care package..."
Supervillain,"Twenty. Your move, Mr. Bont."
Bont,"I'll take a hit, dealer. Joker? You're supposed to take those out of the deck!"
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, sorry. Here's another one."
Bont,"What is this card? ""Rules for Draw and Stud Poker?"""
Supervillain,"What a pity, Mr. Bont..."
Bont,"But, but, It was Homer's fault! I didn't lose! I never lose!"
Bont,"Well, at least tell me the details of your plot for world domination..."
Supervillain,"Oh, I'm not going to fall for that one again."
Troy McClure,"Earlier this year, Homer's long lost mother returned, and so did a long-lost care package."
Mona Simpson,"Homer, please. You don't have to wolf down that twenty-five-year-old candy just to make me happy."
Mario #2,"The store is-a so rich, she'll-a never notice."
Homer Simpson,"But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space Food Sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure! Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom?"
Mona Simpson,"Oh, sure. I read all about it. I mean, it was national news. Do you still work for NASA?"
Homer Simpson,"No, I work at the nuclear power plant."
Mona Simpson,"Oh, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard. Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside."
Troy McClure,"When Homer sold his soul for a donut, he found out that Hell isn't all it's cracked up to be, in these never-before-broadcast scenes..."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Lawyers... lawyers. Ooh, Lionel Hutz. ""Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."""
Bart Simpson,I'd sell my soul for a Formula One racing car!
Devil,That can be arranged.
Bart Simpson,Changed my mind. Sorry. Cool!
Marge Simpson,Bart! Stop pestering Satan!
Lizzie Borden,"Your honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Ow!
Lionel Hutz,"Well, I didn't win. Here's your pizza."
Marge Simpson,But we did win!
Lionel Hutz,That's okay. The box is empty.
Troy McClure,"If that's what they cut out, what they leave in must be pure gold! Let's watch some more of those fabulous ""Simpsons"" outtakes!"
Troy McClure,Apu living with the Simpsons? It happened! And here's a scene you didn't see...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I'm hoping you enjoy this movie. It made every Indian critic's top 400 list.
,
Indian Woman,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE / I'M IN LOVE WITH LOVELY JOHNNY..."
,
Bare-chested Man,Kuttay! Kaminay! Sooer kay batchay!
,
Bart Simpson,This movie you rented sucks.
Bart Simpson,"No, let me try the cup and ball."
Homer Simpson,"No it doesn't, it's funny. Their clothes are different from my clothes. Look at what they're wearin'."
Troy McClure,"A few years back, Bart was adopted by Mr. Burns. In this very special outtake, Homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son. Watch."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, you're coming home."
Bart Simpson,I wanna stay here with Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns,I suggest you leave immediately.
Homer Simpson,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
C. Montgomery Burns,"My worst, eh? Smithers, release the robotic Richard Simmons."
Richard Simmons Robot,"C'mon big boy, shake the butter off those buns!"
Homer Simpson,
Richard Simmons Robot,"C'mon, c'mon girls! Shake shake shake!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, it's out of control."
Waylon Smithers,"I'll take him out, sir."
Richard Simmons Robot,"SHAKE, SHAKE SHAKE \ SHAKE, SHAKE, SHAKE \ SHAKE YOUR HINEY!"
Waylon Smithers,His ass is gonna blow!
Troy McClure,"This past summer, all of America was trying to solve the mystery of ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" Then they found out it was the baby. To keep this bombshell secret, the producers animated several solutions that were never intended to air..."
Troy McClure,"And to keep the show's animators, editors, staff, and hangers-on from leaking the solution, two completely different endings were produced -- one real, one phony. Here's the ending you were never meant to see..."
C. Montgomery Burns,The one who shot me was...
C. Montgomery Burns,Waylon Smithers!
Waylon Smithers,Nooo! Wait a minute. Yes.
C. Montgomery Burns,"With the sun blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world..."
C. Montgomery Burns,So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
C. Montgomery Burns,I feel like celebrating.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, it's you. What are you so happy about?"
C. Montgomery Burns,I see.
Milhouse Van Houten,Get your own!!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Or so I thought. At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of the darkness and fired."
Waylon Smithers,That's right. Just before I'd shot Jasper. I was busy that night.
C. Montgomery Burns,Stricken I lurched forth in search of aide.
C. Montgomery Burns,"But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
Lisa Simpson,"Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S. Waylon Smithers."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not exactly. Smithers, for attempting to kill me, I'm giving you a five percent pay cut."
Waylon Smithers,
Troy McClure,"But of course, for that ending to work, you would have to ignore all the Simpson DNA evidence. And that would be downright nutty."
Troy McClure,"Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts. Who knows what adventures they'll have between now and the time the show becomes unprofitable? I'm Troy McClure, and I'll leave you with what we all came here to see -- hard-core nudity!"
Announcer,"It's...""A Krusty Kinda Kristmas!"" Brought to you by: I.L.G. -- ""Selling your body's chemicals after you die,"" and by Li'l Sweetheart Cupcakes -- a subsidiary of I.L.G."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, hi! I didn't hear you come in. Welcome to my home."
Krusty the Clown,"Say, did I hear some carolers?"
,
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, it's respected private citizen Tom Landry!"
Krusty the Clown,And South American sensation...
Krusty the Clown,"Shoo-shi-sha... Shoo... Sha... She... Shoo... Shoo, boy"
Announcer,"Now, stay tuned for a video Christmas card from Tupac Shakur!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, I thought Krusty was Jewish..."
Mangy Santa,Morry Hasshass ana Offy Ew Ear.
Lisa Simpson,Christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worship Jesus Christ.
Kids,Bo-ring!
Kids,Help!
Santa Claus,Ya want excitement?! Shove this up yer stocking!!
Bart Simpson,Whoa!!
Lisa Simpson,Hmm. That looks entertaining.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
Santa Claus,"So tell your folks: Buy me ""BoneStorm"" or go to hell!"
Bart Simpson,Buy me BoneStorm or go to hell!!
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Homer Simpson,"Young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""..."
Bart Simpson,It's the coolest video game ever!
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including seventy dollars. And they're violent and they distract you from your schoolwork."
Bart Simpson,"Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game."
Homer Simpson,"I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I'll never get that game."
Marge Simpson,Tuck-in time!
Marge Simpson,ALL ABOARD THE SLEEPY TRAIN / TO VISIT MOTHER GOOSE / BARTY'S STOP IS SNOOZY LANE / TO REST HIS SWEET CABOOSE.
Bart Simpson,"Mo-om, I'm not a little kid anymore. Tuck-in Time is lame."
Marge Simpson,"Well, if loving my kids is ""lame,"" then I guess I'm just a big lame."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame."
Marge Simpson,"Well, life is like a box of chocolates --"
Bart Simpson,"Mom! No, Mom!"
Marge Simpson,-- You never know what --
Marge Simpson,--- you're gonna get...
,
Marge Simpson,Ninety-nine cents!
,
Bart Simpson,I want to buy a copy of BoneStorm. Here's ninety-nine cents.
Donkey Kong,It's the company's fault for making you want it so much.
Comic Book Guy,Allow me to summarize the proposed transaction: you wish to purchase BoneStorm for ninety-nine cents. Net profit to me: negative fifty-nine dollars.
Comic Book Guy,"Oh, oh please take my fifty-nine dollars. I don't want it. It's yours."
Comic Book Guy,"Seeing as we are unfamiliar with sarcasm, I shall close the register at this point... ... and state that ninety-nine cents is the rental price."
Bart Simpson,"Then may I please rent it, please?"
Comic Book Guy,"No, you may not. I am all out. Though I do have a surprising abundance of Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge."
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,Milhouse has BoneStorm!
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"This is great! And all I've done is enter my name! ""Thrillhouse!"""
Bart Simpson,"Say, Cool Dude, can I play, too?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, uh... it's only a one player game."
Bart Simpson,"Then how come it says ""2nd Player Score""?!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Mom! Bart's swearing!
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"Hmmm. Maybe if I stand next to the games looking sad, someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one."
,
Rich Suburban Mom,"Gavin, don't you already have this game?"
SPOILED LITTLE BOY,"No, Mom, you idiot. I have BloodStorm and BoneSquad and BloodStorm II, stupid."
Rich Suburban Mom,"Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We'll take a BoneStorm."
Gavin,Get two. I'm not sharing with Caitlin.
Bart Simpson,That must be the happiest kid in the world.
Jimbo Jones,"Psst. Hey, Simpson! Check this out."
Nelson Muntz,Look what I got!
Nelson Muntz,It's the kind I like!
Bart Simpson,Are you guys shoplifting?
Jimbo Jones,"Four finger discount, dude."
Nelson Muntz,"Shoplifting is a victimless crime, like punching someone in the dark."
Mario,"Go ahead-a, Bart. Take-a the BoneStorm!"
Bart Simpson,
Sonic the Hedgehog,Just take it! TakeItTakeItTakeItTakeItTakeIt! TAKE IT!
Bart Simpson,I'm outside. I got away with it! I'm free!
Detective,"Sir, would you open your coat please?"
Bart Simpson,Uh... I don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
Detective,"Please step back into the store, sir."
Bart Simpson,
Rich Suburban Mom,"Tut, tut, tut. That boy's parents must've made some terrible mistakes."
Gavin,"Shut up, Mom."
Santa Claus,"Ho ho ho! Here you go, li'l fella!"
Detective,No. Not for him.
Santa Claus,Oh. I see.
Troy McClure,"Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such public-service videos as ""Designated Drivers: The Life-Saving Nerds"" and ""Phony Tornado Alarms Reduce Readiness."" I'm here today to give you the skinny on shoplifting, thereby completing my plea bargain with the good people at Foot Locker of Beverly Hills."
Troy McClure,"Shoplifting began here, in ancient Phoenicia. Thieves would literally lift the corner of a shop in order to snatch the sweet, sweet olives within. Oh, Sheheqazaramesh , will you ever learn? Flash forward to ancient Babylonia --"
Detective,"Alright, show's over."
Bart Simpson,E-excuse me?
Detective,"You think you're pretty smart, don't you?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Detective,"Don't smart off to me, smart guy."
Bart Simpson,I-I-I could pay for the game. I'll pay for it.
Detective,"That kind of mush might fly at Lamps Plus, but don't peddle it here. If I wanted smoke blown up my ass, I'd be at home with a pack of cigarettes and a short length of hose."
Bart Simpson,
Detective,"That's it, Mr. Comedian. I'm calling your parents."
Bart Simpson,
Detective,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this is Detective Don Brodka from Try-N-Save security. That's right, Don Brodka. Your son Bart has been caught shoplifting. Uh-huh."
Detective,"It's a shame, I know. But try to have a merry Christmas."
Detective,They weren't home. Uh-huh. But I left a message on their answering machine. That's right.
Bart Simpson,"Um, okay, I've really really really learned my lesson. Can I please go now?"
Detective,"Yeah, get out of my sight."
Detective,"Hey kid, one more thing: if you ever set foot in this store again, you'll be spending Christmas in Juvenile Hall, capiche?"
Detective,"Well, do you understand?!"
Bart Simpson,"Everything except ""capiche""..."
Detective,
,
Bart Simpson,"Gotta change that answering machine tape! Oh God, I gotta change that tape!"
Homer Simpson,"Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!"
,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. We didn't have a message when we left. How very odd.
Answering Machine,"Hello, Muddah. Hello, Faddah. Here I am, at Camp Granada..."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?"
Bart Simpson,Now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, didn't you get any milk? All I see is egg nog."
Homer Simpson,"'Tis the season, Marge! We only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!"
Lisa Simpson,I think I'm having chest pains.
Marge Simpson,"Bart, get your suit on."
Bart Simpson,What for?
Marge Simpson,We're getting our Christmas picture taken.
Bart Simpson,"Well, you lucked out, Marge my man, 'cause I'm in a smiling mood today."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, good. So get ready, and before you know it we'll be at the Try-N-Save."
Bart Simpson,Try-N-Save?!
Marge Simpson,"Ahh, my teapots are ready."
Detective,"If you ever set foot in this store again, you'll be spending Christmas in Juvenile Hall... Juvenile Hall... Juvenile Hall..."
Guard,"Stand behind the yellow line! You will now receive your Christmas presents, donated by the Port Authority Lost & Found Office. Pass your chit to Santa to receive your gift! If you do not have a chit, you will not receive a gift!"
Jimbo Jones,Wow! The March 8th newspaper!
Nelson Muntz,Cool! A book of carpet samples!
Bart Simpson,"Come on, new bike!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart, what's taking so long? If you're having that problem with your zipper, I can send your father up."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, I'm not."
Marge Simpson,What's the matter with your face? Is that a fake nose? Are you wearing chin putty?
Bart Simpson,I don't have to listen to these wild allegations.
Marge Simpson,"Please, Bart, no more pranks. It would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo."
Homer Simpson,Hey! I don't remember saying that!
,
Marge Simpson,Uh-oh. Almost forgot to lock the doors.
Detective,"I hope you're going to the Valley Vista Try-N-Save, kid, 'cause you don't want to come to my store. Cat-feesh?"
,
Bart Simpson,"So we're just going to do this photo and get out, right? Ba-da-bing ba-da-boom?"
Lisa Simpson,I wanna look at the pets and write things on the typewriters and see if the new dictionaries are in!
Marge Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,I wanna price some flip-flops and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!
Marge Simpson,"Sure. We're gonna have a great day. Ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right Bart? Bart?"
Marge Simpson,"What's wrong, honey?"
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Somebody's got tired little legs.
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. Wonder where the flip-flops are.... ""Menswear?"""
Homer Simpson,"Maybe it's ""Sporting Goods""... Wait, no, ""Sleepwear""... Oh, probably ""Better Living."""
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie. Look at that watch. I've always wanted a watch like that."
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas..."
Homer Simpson,Pfft. Must have been a pretty slow century.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey Assel Adams, let's go! Take the photo!"
Marge Simpson,Wait! Wait! I don't want Maggie's face hidden behind that pacifier.
Photographer,"Don't worry, Momma. I can put a smile on Baby's face."
Photographer,"Okay, Sugarplum, it's time to meet Mr. Funny-Voice. Helloooo-- --oooh, it's just air."
Bart Simpson,"Well, c'mon! Hurry up!"
Photographer,"Okay, people."
Photographer,"One, two, three."
Detective,I thought I told you: no returns for busted merchandise.
Homer Simpson,What are you doing to my son?!!
Detective,I'm afraid your son broke the Eleventh Commandment: Thou shalt not steal.
Marge Simpson,That's crazy! Bart's not a shoplifter! He's just a little boy!
Detective,"Oh sure, now he's just a little boy stealing little toys, but someday he'll be a grown man stealing stadiums... And quarries."
Marge Simpson,"My son may not be perfect, but I know in my heart he's not a shoplifter."
Marge Simpson,Fine. Play the tape. Then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy.
Bart Simpson,"Wait! Mom, I don't want you to see this."
Bart Simpson,I did it.
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart."
,
Homer Simpson,"Stealing?! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain what's-his-name? We live in a society of laws. Why do you think I took you to all those ""Police Academy"" movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Where was I? Oh yeah, stay out of my booze!"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'm really sorry."
Marge Simpson,I know you are...
Bart Simpson,Is there anything I can do?
,
Bart Simpson,Okay.
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Man, I thought Mom was gonna scream me stupid. She didn't even raise her voice."
Lisa Simpson,"I admit I haven't known Mom as long as you have, but I know when she's really upset. Her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom counter-top. It absorbs everything that touches it, like this bathroom rug."
,
Bart Simpson,Really? You think this might be one of those forever-type things?
Marge Simpson,Lisa's on the sleepy train / To rest her weary head / Her ticket is a candy cane / Made out of gingerbread.
Lisa Simpson,"Goodnight, Mom."
Marge Simpson,"Goodnight, sweetheart."
Bart Simpson,"Oh great, the tuck-in express in right on time."
Marge Simpson,Goodnight.
Homer Simpson,"I've figured out the boy's punishment. First: he's grounded. No leaving the house, not even for school. Second: No eggnog. In fact, no nog period. And third, absolutely no stealing for three months."
Marge Simpson,"I always thought I understood my special little guy. But somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine."
Homer Simpson,"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
Marge Simpson,He's not my little baby anymore. Maybe I mother him too much.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Mom. You didn't wake me up."
Marge Simpson,Here's your hot chocolate.
Bart Simpson,You didn't put my marshmallow in.
Marge Simpson,I think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
Bart Simpson,Okay. I can handle that.
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, give me a slice!"
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, do you ever worry that your mom might stop loving you?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"What? I'm more worried about piranhas. Did you see that movie where they send a nuclear submarine to fight the piranhas and one of them swims right down the periscope and bites the guy in the eye and he goes ""Aaaaaagh! Aaaagh! Aaaagh!"" and that old lady told 'em it would happen?!"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, that was pretty good."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, how come you're not playing BoneStorm?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Ehh, it got boring. I'm really into this cup and ball now."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Whoa! Wow! Man, you never know which way this crazy ball is going to go!"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right. You're just trying to trick me because you don't want me playing with your videogame."
Milhouse Van Houten,Here. Go ahead.
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, don't be a cup and ball hog!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Mom! Bart's smoking!
,
Bart Simpson,"Okay, okay, I won't bug Milhouse... But... Well, Mrs. Van Houten, this is gonna sound kinda dumb, but can I hang out with you while you do mom stuff?"
Bart Simpson,Who are Dan and Sherry Adler?
Luann Van Houten,Just friends of ours.
Bart Simpson,Oh. And who is Warren Burke?
Luann Van Houten,He used to tune our piano before we got rid of it. He grew up in Mechanicsburg.
Bart Simpson,Really.
Luann Van Houten,Mmmm-hmmm.
Bart Simpson,Tell me I'm good.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's Mom! She's happy again!"
Bart Simpson,You guys made a snowman family?
Homer Simpson,"Check it out, boy! It's like looking into a living snow mirror!"
Bart Simpson,Why didn't you wait for me?
Marge Simpson,I didn't think you'd mind. I figured you were getting a little too old for this. But you can still make one. There's some snow left under the car.
,
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,Stupid family...
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Simpson. Look what I swiped from Try-N-Save."
Nelson Muntz,It's a replacement tire for a wheelbarrow.
Bart Simpson,Huh.
Nelson Muntz,I knew you'd like it.
Bart Simpson,"Everybody thinks I'm the black sheep. Well, I'll show them what a black sheep can do."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, this fake snow is making me dizzy!"
Marge Simpson,We're almost finished. There's just a little bit of green left.
Marge Simpson,There you are! You can help me spray the cookies...
Marge Simpson,Are you hiding something? What do you have under your jacket?
Bart Simpson,Nothing.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart, not again... Give it to me."
Bart Simpson,I told you I don't have anything.
Marge Simpson,"You can't hide from me in this house, Bart! I spend 23 hours a day here!"
Homer Simpson,"Get 'im, Ma!"
Marge Simpson,"There's no place left to run, Bart. Hand it over."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart. I can't believe you did this."
Bart Simpson,I wanted to surprise you for Christmas...
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Sweetie. This is the best present a mother could get."
Marge Simpson,"I love you so much, my little Bitty Barty."
Bart Simpson,Mo-ommm...
Marge Simpson,"Since I got my present early, I think you should get yours early too."
Lisa Simpson,Bart got a present early? Then I should get a present early! I want a present!
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, you have to wait."
Lisa Simpson,This is the worst Christmas ever.
Marge Simpson,"Now, I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk which is the one every boy wants..."
Bart Simpson,You got me...?
Bart Simpson,"Uh, yeahhh! Thanks, Mom."
Lee Carvallo,"Welcome to Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge. I am Carvallo. Now, choose a club."
Lee Carvallo,You have chosen a three-wood. May I suggest a putter?
Lee Carvallo,"Three-wood. Now enter the force of your swing. I suggest ""feather touch."""
Lee Carvallo,"You have entered ""power drive."" Now push 7-8-7 to swing."
Lee Carvallo,Ball is in... parking lot. Would you like to play again?
Lee Carvallo,"You have selected ""no."""
,
Bart Simpson,"Omigod! The ""Mad Magazine Special Edition""! They only put out seventeen of these a year!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Boy, they're really socking it to that Spiro Agnew guy again! He must work there or something."
Bart Simpson,Let's do the fold-in.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Okay. ""What higher power do TV evangelists worship?"""
Bart Simpson,I'll say God.
Milhouse Van Houten,I'll say Jesus.
Milhouse Van Houten,THE ALL-MIGHTY DOLLAR?!!
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Comic Book Guy,"You fold it, you bought it."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo! ""Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions""! I'm great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy."
Bart Simpson,Does something smell funny in here?
Homer Simpson,"I don't think so, stupid!"
Marge Simpson,"Homie, you want pork chops?"
Homer Simpson,"No, I want roast beef, you clod!"
Bart Simpson,"Look at this! Special insert -- ""Iron-On Mad-ness!"" ""BAN THE BATH,"" ""DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER TEN,"" ""SOCK IT TO ME""..."
Marge Simpson,Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
Homer Simpson,The All igh-ty ollar? I get it.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Gee, business stinks tonight. Where's Barney, Lenny, and Carl?"
Homer Simpson,Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, might as well close the dump."
Mayor Joe Quimby,I'm gonna drink you under the table.
Quimby #2,"No, I am going to drink you under the..."
Quimbys,Awwww.
Homer Simpson,"Well, you're closing. It's getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. There's gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think."
,
Bowling Clerk,"Sorry, it's ""League Night."" I couldn't give a lane to my own mother."
Lunchlady Doris,I have no son.
Moe Szyslak,"Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people, you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what?! For some pimply little puke to treat you like dirt unless you're on a ""team!"" Well I'm better than dirt... Well, most kinds of dirt... I mean, not that fancy store-bought dirt. That stuff's loaded with nutrients. I... I can't compete with that stuff."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well. But who am I to complain?
Homer Simpson,I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we can be a team!"
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! We won! We won!
Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl."
Bowling Clerk,You're short one person.
Homer Simpson,Uh...
Homer Simpson,That longhair freak's bowled with us for years.
Otto Mann,"I don't care if it takes all night, I'm gonna get me that lobster harmonica!"
Otto Mann,"Come on, lobsti."
Otto Mann,Whoa.
Bowling Clerk,"Okay, then, I just need your five hundred dollar registration fee."
Homer Simpson,"Five hundred dollars?! No problem. Would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?"
,
Marge Simpson,"No, I will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, come on, Marge! You're getting something in return! And I'm getting a bowling team. It's win/win!"
Marge Simpson,It's sick! And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. Like Mr. Burns.
Homer Simpson,"Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
Marge Simpson,For what?
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I've got to get the third degree from you, too?"
,
Edna Krabappel,Tonight's homework assignment is...
Bart Simpson,"Oh man, is it hot in here! I better take off my sweater."
Edna Krabappel,Down... With... HOMEWORK?!
Edna Krabappel,"Don't look at it, children!"
Milhouse Van Houten,The shirt makes a good point.
Nelson Muntz,I'm with the shirt. Homework rots!
Class,Down with homework! Down with homework! Down with homework!
,
Seymour Skinner,"As I was saying, my yearly evaluation couldn't've come at a better time."
Gary Chalmers,"Well, Seymour, I must say for once I am impressed. In fact, I'm going to give this school a perfect ten. I'll just write the zero first. Now a vertical line to indicate the one..."
Students,Down with homework! Down with homework! Down with homework!
Gary Chalmers,Skinner!!! Why are there children walking on my head?
,
Seymour Skinner,"So we meet again, Mad Magazine..."
Bart Simpson,How do you know it's from Mad?
Seymour Skinner,"The year was 1968. We were on re-con in a steaming Mekong delta. An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan, ""UP WITH MINI-SKIRTS."" Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it."
Seymour Skinner,"But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed ""Charlie"" to get the drop on us. I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States, but they just can't get the spices right..."
Bart Simpson,"... Ah, my punishment?"
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm... Oh. I'm going to have to think about that. Meanwhile, wear this home."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Oooo... I need some more ether. I can still feel the movement of the emery board.
Waylon Smithers,"We're fresh out, Sir. I'll get some more."
C. Montgomery Burns,Leave the rag.
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Excuse me, Mr. Burns?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Pop 'n Fresh! You glutinous little doughboy! Oh, there's something I've wanted to do to you for years."
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, why, certainly, Pop 'n Fresh. I... I owe my robust physique to your tubes of triple-bleached goo."
C. Montgomery Burns,Woo hoo!
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody, if you want to ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or something!"
,
Hans Moleman,"Ah, excuse me. I'd like to request seventeen dollars for a push-broom rebristling."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun! I'm going to get your lucky charms."
,
Hans Moleman,"Oh, no! My brains."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, nice quote uniforms, end quote."
Kent Brockman,This just in. A new addition to our worst-dressed list... those guys.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, forget this. I am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us."
Moe Szyslak,Ya... you're right. That's the kind of thing that would haunt you.
Bumblebee Man,"Si! Buenos noches, senoritas!"
Moe Szyslak,Whud he say?! Whud he say?! Was that about me?
Otto Mann,"Okay, Otto. Pressure's on. Don't-choke-don't-choke-don't-choke-dooooon't-- -- CHOKE!!"
Otto Mann,"Oh, man! I knew I was gonna choke!"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, that's a funny-looking strike."
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, guys. Let's be the team that supports each other. YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / HELP EACH OTHER OUT, THAT'LL BE OUR MOTTO..."
Moe Szyslak,YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT OTTO...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,MAKE THIS SPARE I'LL GIVE YOU FREE GELATTO...
Moe Szyslak,THEN BACK TO MY PLACE WHERE I WILL GET YOU BLOTTO...
Homer Simpson,"DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO..."
Moe Szyslak,YOU CAN DO IT OTTO / YOU CAN DO IT...
Otto Mann,"Uh, guys. I made the spare. We won."
Moe Szyslak,Yayyy! / Way to go! / The Pin Pals did it! / We won! / Team work! /
Al,Those beers are five dollars apiece.
,
Homer Simpson,"Lemme set the scene for you, Marge."
Marge Simpson,All right.
Homer Simpson,It's a 7-10 split.
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
Homer Simpson,The hardest shot in bowling. It was all up to me.
Marge Simpson,Ooh.
Homer Simpson,"So I got up all my courage. Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match."
Marge Simpson,Who knocked down the pins?
Homer Simpson,"I don't know. You know, some guy. Otto, I guess."
Marge Simpson,Good for him!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're missing the point. The individual doesn't matter. It was a team effort and I was the one who came up with the whole team idea. Me."
Marge Simpson,I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split. He's phenomenal!
Homer Simpson,But... but...
Marge Simpson,Wow!
,
Seymour Skinner,"Several days ago, a violent riot erupted, incited by an inflammatory T-shirt slogan."
Seymour Skinner,No! No! Now don't try to remember what that slogan was.
Seymour Skinner,"To ensure that this frenzied dance of destruction is never repeated, I have decided, starting Monday, all students will be required to wear uniforms."
Students,Uniforms?!
Lunchlady Doris,"Say hello to our little genius Martin, who looks even smarter in this vest and short pant combination from Mr. Boy of Main Street. Or how about Little Lisa Simpson..."
Lunchlady Doris,"She'll have no reason to play the blues in this snappy ensemble, topped off with a saucy French beret that seems to scream , ""Silence."""
Seymour Skinner,"All right. Pick your size, extra-small or extra-large. We've got both. No pushing now... I... What?... Oh. I've just been informed we've run out of extra-large."
,
Otto Mann,"GO, MOE / GO MOE / DON'T MAKE HOMER SHOUT OUT !"
Otto Mann,Alright! The Pin Pals win again! Etc.
Chief Wiggum,"All right, Snake, make us proud."
Snake Jailbird,One... two... three... four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten -- 'Bye!
Chief Wiggum,Ahh... We forfeit.
Homer Simpson,"There it is, boys, the championship trophy!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,We will never possess it. The Holy Rollers have won it five years in a row.
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, they think they're so high and mighty, just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants."
Homer Simpson,"Ah, ha, ha, ha, God-boy couldn't get a strike."
Ned Flanders,It's me... Ned.
,
Otto Mann,"Whoa! Whatever I got ahold of, it's big!"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, my sling shot doesn't fit in these pockets. And these shorts leave nothing to the imagination. These uniforms suck!"
Marge Simpson,Bart! Where do you pick up words like that?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night! They just plain sucked! I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!"
Marge Simpson,Homer! Watch your mouth!
Homer Simpson,Gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.
Lisa Simpson,We are not wieners!
Homer Simpson,Then what are you dressed like that for?
Bart Simpson,They made us!
Homer Simpson,"""They made us!"" That's loser talk! You gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! Nothing's gonna stop us now!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling!
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, sir. That's a check for your boweling."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes. That's very important."
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, sir. Remember that month you didn't do it?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, that was unpleasant for all concerned. Anyway, back to the checks... Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling!"
Waylon Smithers,"Hmmm. The memo says, ""To my pal, Pop 'n Fresh."""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes. That greedy, grasping, glob of chemicals."
Waylon Smithers,"Probably one of your ether-induced hallucinations, sir. I'll check the employee files to see who could pull off such an impersonation."
Waylon Smithers,"Now, it was either Pops Freshenmeyer..."
Waylon Smithers,Or Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Let's shut down this bowling scam right now."
,
Moe Szyslak,"COME ON HOMER, COME ON HOMER / PRETEND THIS IS BASEBALL / AND HIT US A HOMER!"
Moe Szyslak,"Way to go, Homer! We win again! Good job! Etc."
Homer Simpson,"By the way, rhyming Homer with Homer..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at them, Smithers, enjoying their embezzlement."
Waylon Smithers,"I have a much uglier word for it, Sir: ""Misappropriation."""
Waylon Smithers,Simpson!
C. Montgomery Burns,Listen here... I want to join your team.
Homer Simpson,You want to join my what?
Waylon Smithers,You want to what his team?
C. Montgomery Burns,I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart. Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe... I haven't felt this energized since my last... boweling.
Otto Mann,"Oh, man, he'll blow our winning streak."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old people are no good at everything."
Homer Simpson,"Look, guys. It's not that simple, he's my boss. I'll tell you what: I'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no."
,
Homer Simpson,Welcome aboard. It wasn't any easier.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Ahhh, these uniforms are a godsend. Horseplay is down 40 percent. Youthful exuberance has been cut in half, and high spirits are at an all-time low."
Nurselady Doris,They've even begun blinking in unison.
Seymour Skinner,I love that sound.
,
Edna Krabappel,"Now, children, while you're having quiet time, I'm going to make sure my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall."
Bart Simpson,"Oh! There's something I used to do in this situation, but... can't... remember..."
Nelson Muntz,Haw... Ho?
,
Otto Mann,"Whoo, I can't believe I got booted off the team for Mister Businessman. I bet I'll get a little respect once I get that Harvard Diploma."
C. Montgomery Burns,Look at that. All the way to the end with only one push.
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, that's the third game in a row he cost us, Homer!"
Luigi,Mama mia!
Groundskeeper Willie,Hoot mon!
Cletus Spuckler,Yee haw!
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arrgh, me maties. Arrgh."
Otto Mann,Yes!!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Whoo! They begged me to join their team. Begged me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh fellas?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, yes. That silly championship? The only ""ship"" worth a damn is friendship. Look, here comes the friend ship, sailing your way..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oooh, here, let me get that, friend."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oops, lost a nail. Well, that's leprosy for you."
,
Rod Flanders,"You're ""it."""
Lisa Simpson,"Now you are the one who is ""it."""
Milhouse Van Houten,Understood.
Gary Chalmers,"Well, I've gotta hand it to you, Seymour. These drab student coverings have created the perfect distraction-free environment, thus preparing the children for permanent positions in tomorrow's mills and processing facilities. Best of all, with less than a minute to go before I leave, absolutely nothing has gone wrong."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, it is starting to rain, but I can hardly be blamed for that, can I?"
Gary Chalmers,"Yes, very good."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, look at all the colors, man!"
Lisa Simpson,"Red, green, yellow, orange! I remember all of these!"
Milhouse Van Houten,I'm freaking out!
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, something's comin' back to me! Down with homework!"
Martin Prince,And down with uniforms!
Gary Chalmers,Ow!Ow!Ow!Ow! Skinner!!! Why aren't these uniforms colorfast?
Seymour Skinner,I don't understand it. I got them at the same place I buy Mother's dresses. Good Lord! Mother's in the park!
Gary Chalmers,Now this I gotta see!
,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship. Now thanks to Burns it's never gonna happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
Driver,
Homer Simpson,So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!
Homer Simpson,Marge! Someone broke the toilet!
,
Moe Szyslak,"Don't worry about nothin', Homer. I have a feeling that Mr. Burns is gonna have a little accident that might keep him from bowling with us tonight. Heh, heh, heh..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be able to play tonight. My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again, and..."
Moe Szyslak,Take that!
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! That precision assault popped it back into place! Thank you masked stranger!
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, he's gonna ruin everything. All right, that's it Homer! Either Burns goes or Moe goes."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Yes. I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat with my name in place of Moe's name.
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?"
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you all a little something."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, would you look at that. The Pin Pals."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've always been wealthy , but this is the first time I ever felt rich."
Homer Simpson,Awww.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me..."
Homer Simpson,You're off the team.
C. Montgomery Burns,What?
Moe Szyslak,"Homer! He's just ribbing you, Monty."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Yes.
C. Montgomery Burns,You guys!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Hallelujah.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nice one, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Thanks.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Okay. The Holy Rollers are ahead by one pin and we only have one bowler left... Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think?"
Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, trophy."
C. Montgomery Burns,You mean I won.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"But we were a team, Sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh. I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart. You see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. Now, I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. Ta!"
Homer Simpson,"I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change, and then quickly change back."
Moe Szyslak,"You know what? We don't need him or his trophy. We got each other, huh?"
Otto Mann,GO HOMER YOU'RE OUR MAN / IF YOU CAN'T DO IT NO ONE CAN!
Homer Simpson,
Otto Mann,I guess no one can.
Moe Szyslak,"Run, before they're through feeding!"
,
Sportscaster #1,"Live from the famous brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware, it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building... Preview!"
Homer Simpson,Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.
Sportscaster #2,Bikini girls! Dune buggies! Daredevil surfers!
Sportscaster #2,"Ordinarily this beach would be swarming with them... but not today. Oh, no. They've all been cleared out to make way for painstaking sand preparation."
Sportscaster #1,"That's right, Dick. Y'know, this year everyone's abuzz about one thing: The absence of Mark Rodkin. Oh, wait, there he is."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm bored."
Marge Simpson,Why don't you read something?
Homer Simpson,Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.
Marge Simpson,"Well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale."
Marge Simpson,You'd get some fresh air and exercise.
Homer Simpson,Eh. I'll do it anyway.
Homer Simpson,"Come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors."
,
Homer Simpson,Good ol' Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.
Bart Simpson,"Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?"
Homer Simpson,It's easier. Duh.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"""THE DREAM POLICE / THEY LIVE INSIDE OF MY BED / THE DREAM POLICE POLICE / THEY COME TO ME IN MY HEAD / THE DREAM POLICE / THEY COME TO ARREST ME NOW / OH, NOOOO.... """
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Howdy, neighbor! May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, spray the boy."
Homer Simpson,"Well, ready for the big rummage sale?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, yes, indeed. I've got nothing but time until they fix that malfunctioning Squishee machine."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I never noticed this place!"
Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's right across the street from us!"
Bart Simpson,That fancy house'll never sell. Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
Homer Simpson,"Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?"
Bart Simpson,"Who are you talking to, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,The guy who doesn't live there.
,
Marge Simpson,"Can we get rid of this ""Ayatollah"" T-shirt? Khomeini died years ago."
Homer Simpson,"But, Marge, it works on any Ayatollah! Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi... Even as we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!"
Marge Simpson,"I don't care who's consolidating their power. Well, we don't need this."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun. I need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing."
Marge Simpson,"Who's ""Disco Stu?"""
Homer Simpson,"Oh. I wanted to write ""DISCO STUD"" but I ran out of space. Not that ""Disco Stu"" didn't get his share of the action!"
,
Ned Flanders,"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
Ned Flanders,"Well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick. Like this..."
Ned Flanders,"What the heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick?"
Mrs. Glick,"It is a candy dish, Ned! Ninety dollars!"
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Well, I... uh, I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
Mrs. Glick,"No! Just candy, Ned... Ninety dollars!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, looks like somebody sold something today."
Marge Simpson,"Are you interested in that motorized tie rack, Principal Skinner?"
Seymour Skinner,Mmm. It's awfully loud.
Marge Simpson,"Well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack..."
Seymour Skinner,"But now the ties are motionless. And those in back are virtually inaccessible! Well, it's a moot point, as I have only one tie to begin with. I believe I'll pass."
Seymour Skinner,Have you sold that tie rack yet?
Marge Simpson,No.
Seymour Skinner,I'll take it.
Ned Flanders,"Now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
Guy In Crowd,"Stu, you should buy that."
Disco Stu,"Hey, Disco Stu doesn't advertise."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, hey Ned, lemme help you with that."
Homer Simpson,Hey everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"So, anyone here from... Evergreen Terrace?"
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,I think this is the best neighborhood in town. Anybody agree with me?
Crowd,
Carl Carlson,"You're the king, Homer!"
Chief Wiggum,King of the neighborhood!
Homer Simpson,Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"Well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
Moe Szyslak,Right here!
Homer Simpson,And for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
Seymour Skinner,I'll take that.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, big spender! / Dig this blender! / Rainbow suspenders!..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, big spender!..."
Crowd,We surrender!...
Homer Simpson,Spend some dough at Table Three!
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, neighbors, thank you! Now let's give it up for Table Five! Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Five, Table Five... Ah-ah-ah-ah / Table Fi-i-i-i-i-i-ve..."
Homer Simpson,"Table Five, Table Five..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!"
Disco Stu,Disco Stu likes disco music.
George H.W. Bush,"Hi there, neighbors. I'm George Bush."
George H.W. Bush,Former President George Bush?
Crowd,
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Wow, a former president, living right across the street!"
Homer Simpson,Why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him. Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
Homer Simpson,Stupid president. Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
Lisa Simpson,"Actually this is one of the nine states where Mr. Bush claims residency, Dad. I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood."
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him--"
Marge Simpson,You didn't vote for anybody.
Homer Simpson,"I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle. After that, I became deeply cynical."
,
Agent Johnson,"And your business here, Mr. Flanders?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the Neighborhood Association."
George H.W. Bush,"Never mind about that, Ray. Just give 'em a quick pass with the metal detector and let 'em on in. Hey, Bar, the neighbors are here!"
Ned Flanders,"Howdily-Doodily there, President Bush--or should I say President Neighbor! I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd."
George H.W. Bush,"Well howdily-doodily yourself there, Ned."
George H.W. Bush,"This's my wife, Barbara. I call her ""Bar."" 'Dja like some lemonade?"
Ned Flanders,Tip-top-notch!
George H.W. Bush,Okily-Dokily!
Ned Flanders,Thankily-dankily! Greatalicious!
George H.W. Bush,Scrumpdiddlerific!
GEORGE BUSH & FLANDERS,Fine and dandy! Like sour candy!
George H.W. Bush,"Bar's a whiz with cold drinks, aren'tcha, Bar? Don't understand lemonade myself. Not my fortÃ©."
Maude Flanders,What brings you to Springfield?
BARBARA,"Well, George and I just wanted to be private citizens again. Go where nobody cared about politics. So we found the town with the lowest voter turnout in America."
George H.W. Bush,"Just happy to be here among good, average people with no particular hopes or dreams."
Rod Flanders,"But, Mr. President, we're not all good people."
Todd Flanders,"There's one little boy you should watch out for. He's a bad, bad little boy."
Ned Flanders,"Now, Todd, don't scare the president."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to Bush."
Santa's Little Helper,
Homer Simpson,I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. Heh heh heh.
Homer Simpson,
,
George H.W. Bush,"Just gonna relax with my U.S. News and World Whatnot. Oh, good, they're roasting the new guy!"
Bart Simpson,"Helloooo, Mr. Bush!"
BARBARA,"George, this is a neighborhood boy, Bart Simpson. He came over to say hi."
George H.W. Bush,Hello.
Bart Simpson,"Hi!... Hey, what's this?"
George H.W. Bush,My electric card shuffler. Don't go near that --
George H.W. Bush,"Now I told you! Aw, those cards were from Air Force One... and they only give you so many packs!"
BARBARA,"Oh, George, boys will be boys. Bart's just being friendly. Why don't you get off that sofa and show Bart your photos?"
George H.W. Bush,"Aw, but he'll gunk 'em all up. His hands are probably covered with mud and cookies."
,
Bart Simpson,"Who's that, George?"
George H.W. Bush,That's me with Charlton Heston. He was --
Bart Simpson,"Who's that, George?"
George H.W. Bush,"See, you wouldn't know him. That's Bob Mosbacher. He was Secretary of--"
Bart Simpson,"That's a dumb name. Who's that, George?"
George H.W. Bush,"Maybe he thinks ""Bart"" is a dumb--"
Bart Simpson,"How many times were you president, George?"
George H.W. Bush,Just once. Bar? Isn't it time for dinner yet?
BARBARA,I'm making rice. It'll be awhile.
Bart Simpson,"Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anybody, George?"
George H.W. Bush,"You know, in my day, little boys didn't call their elders by their first names."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, well, welcome to the twentieth century, George."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, I've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those Breakfast Balls..."
Homer Simpson,
George H.W. Bush,"Let's see now, what do you folks have here, huh? Hmmm... a ""Krusty"" burger. That doesn't sound too appetizing. What kind of stew do you have today?"
Teenage Kid,"Oh, we don't have stew."
Agent Johnson,"Sir, why don't you just have the cheeseburger?"
George H.W. Bush,"That's really more of a weekend thing, Ray."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, jerk! Move your fanny!"
George H.W. Bush,"That guy's louder than World War Two. Ray, go see what the rhubarb is, willya?"
Agent Johnson,"Sir, could you pop your hood?"
Homer Simpson,Hey! My taxes paid for that horn!
,
Bart Simpson,"Why hello, Mrs. Bush."
BARBARA,"Hi, Bart. Mr. Bush is upstairs napping."
Bart Simpson,"You know, your husband's awful grumpy."
BARBARA,"Oh, that's just his way. He really likes you... You know, it's time for him to get up and work on his memoirs. Why don't you go wake him?"
George H.W. Bush,What the?! Great Scott! Don't touch that! That's the alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me!
Bart Simpson,Where'd you get those pajamas?
George H.W. Bush,They're presidential pajamas. You have to be president. And you're not president.
Bart Simpson,Yes I am.
George H.W. Bush,No you're not! Bar!!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, where's your candy?"
George H.W. Bush,We don't have any! Now go away!
BARBARA,"George!... Older people don't eat much candy, Bart, but I could bake you some cookies if you like."
George H.W. Bush,Can't remember the last time she made cookies for me.
BARBARA,What's that?
George H.W. Bush,Oh... nothing.
,
Homer Simpson,"All right. His story checks out. Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it will make you happy."
Marge Simpson,"Homie. As long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy."
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can always depend on that."
,
George H.W. Bush,"""... and since I'd achieved all my goals as President in one term, there was no need for a second. The end."""
George H.W. Bush,"Good memoirs. Good, not great. Now let's look at that old outboard. Soup that baby up, rattle a few windows down in Kennebunkport next May. Heh heh."
Bart Simpson,"Helloooo, Mr. Bush!"
Bart Simpson,Whatcha doing?
George H.W. Bush,"Now, now don't upset the desk there... Careful, don't wanna horse around with--"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, cool, what does this do?"
George H.W. Bush,"Now don't you pull that cord, young man!"
,
George H.W. Bush,"Aw, now look what you-- whoops! Hey! Bar! My motor's gone loco!"
George H.W. Bush,"Aw, the birdhouse..."
George H.W. Bush,My prize orchids!...
George H.W. Bush,"Oh, no. Not the memoirs. Don't even think about it. Not gonna happen."
George H.W. Bush,
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, man."
George H.W. Bush,"Whoa, nothing. I'm gonna do something your daddy shoulda done a long time ago."
George H.W. Bush,"Now go home and think about what you've done, young man."
,
Homer Simpson,"He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?"
Bart Simpson,"I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation."
Grampa Simpson,Big deal! When I was a pup we got spanked by presidents 'til the cows came home! Grover Cleveland spanked me on two nonconsecutive occasions!
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, I know in your day spanking was common, but Homer and I just don't believe in that kind of punishment."
Grampa Simpson,And that's why your no good kids are running wild!
Homer Simpson,"First Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way I talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bush! Get out here!"
Agent Johnson,"Excuse me, sir, where are you going?"
Homer Simpson,I'm going to punch George Bush in the face!
Agent Johnson,Okay is he expecting you?
Homer Simpson,You owe me an apology!
George H.W. Bush,"Hey, you owe me an apology! If you were any kind of a father you'd've disciplined that boy a long time ago."
Agent Johnson,"You wanna step back, sir. You're trampling the flowers."
Homer Simpson,"Oooh? Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Oooh! Well, you are a wimp."
George H.W. Bush,"Wimp, am I?... Agent Johnson, Agent Heintz, you men stand down."
George H.W. Bush,"All right, mister. You want trouble, you're gonna get trouble."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I want trouble all right."
George H.W. Bush,Then you're gonna get trouble.
Homer Simpson,"No, you're gonna get trouble."
George H.W. Bush,"Well, that's good, that's good, 'cause I want trouble."
Homer Simpson,Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
George H.W. Bush,"Oh, yeah. Lots of trouble."
Homer Simpson,Trouble it is.
George H.W. Bush,For you.
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,This is gonna be sweet. Two hundred bottle rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.
Bart Simpson,"If you get one up his butt, it's a million points."
,
BARBARA,"Why don't you just say you're sorry, George?"
George H.W. Bush,"Because I'm right! Oh, no, I'm gonna fix their wagon good. I've pulled some pranks in my time..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I... I don't understand. Are you saying you and Barbara are bad neighbors?
,
Ned Flanders,Who? Maude and me?
George H.W. Bush,"No! The man and his boy! You know! The boy is named Bart. I don't know the name of the man. Bar, what's the name of the man?"
BARBARA,"I'm not getting involved, George."
George H.W. Bush,"Look, just never mind. I thought the banner was pretty straightforward, but I guess I'll just take it down."
BARBARA,"George, it's time to get dressed."
George H.W. Bush,"Uh-unh, I'm not going outside today, not with those neighbors. Staying right here 'til my speech to the Elks Club."
Homer Simpson,Yoo hoo?
,
George H.W. Bush,Who is it?
Homer Simpson,"It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!"
George H.W. Bush,"Oh, good. Bar, the boys are out in the front yard. They'll help me think of a plan to get those Simpsons."
BARBARA,"Oh, George, is that all you ever think about? The boys probably just want a letter of recommendation."
George H.W. Bush,Boys? Where you going?
Homer Simpson,"Okay, son! Give him the glue!"
HOMER AND BART,
,
George H.W. Bush,... And that's why I will continue to oppose teen alcoholism in all its forms.
Elks,
George H.W. Bush,Now are there any questions?
George H.W. Bush,...Keeping in mind that I already explained about my hair?
Elks,"Oh, yeah / Right. / Etc."
,
Marge Simpson,President Bush is driving on our lawn! He must be lost.
Homer Simpson,He's not lost.
Bart Simpson,Looks like we're experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.
Homer Simpson,It's time to hit him where he lives.
Bart Simpson,His house?
Homer Simpson,Bingo.
,
Homer Simpson,"So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?"
Bart Simpson,Locusts. They'll drive him nuts.
Homer Simpson,"It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!"
,
George H.W. Bush,I can't decide if this'll be considered feisty or crazy.
George H.W. Bush,"Hey! What the...? If he thinks George Bush'll stay out of the sewer, he doesn't know George Bush!"
,
George H.W. Bush,"Hey, turkeys! Behind ya!"
Homer Simpson,"For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!"
George H.W. Bush,Never! You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs!
Homer Simpson,You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!
Bart Simpson,"Yay, Dad!"
,
BARBARA,"I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge. George can be so stubborn when he thinks he's right."
Marge Simpson,"Well Homer, too. They're so much alike."
BARBARA,Too bad they got off on the wrong foot. It's just like the Noriega thing. Now he and George are the best of friends.
,
George H.W. Bush,Here's a little something we learned in the C.I.A.
Bart Simpson,"Get him, boys!!"
,
GORBACHEV,Hello? Hello?
George H.W. Bush,I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet! I'll take your head and... Gorbachev? What are you doing here?
GORBACHEV,I just drop by with present for warming of house. Instead find you grappling with local oaf.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
George H.W. Bush,"But Mikhail, they put a wig on my head and my memoirs..."
BARBARA,"George, this is the last straw! You apologize to Homer right now!"
George H.W. Bush,But Bar! We can't show any weakness in front of the Russians!
BARBARA,George...
George H.W. Bush,"Yes, dear."
GORBACHEV,
George H.W. Bush,"I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! In your face, Bush! Now apologize for the tax hike."
,
BARBARA,"It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge, but George just felt this neighborhood brought out the worst in him and--"
BARBARA,"Oh, my. Well, so long."
Marge Simpson,Bye bye!
Man,Hi.
Gerald Ford,Pleased to meet you. I just moved in. My name is Jerry Ford.
Homer Simpson,Former President Gerald Ford? Put 'er there! I'm Homer Simpson.
Gerald Ford,"Say, Homer, do you like football?"
Homer Simpson,Do I ever!
Gerald Ford,Do you like nachos?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Mr. Ford!"
Gerald Ford,"Well, why don't you come over and watch the game and we'll have nachos. And then some beer."
Homer Simpson,"Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just fi--"
Homer Simpson,
Bumblebee Man,Ai! Que agonia!
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, he wants that corn so much!"
Bumblebee Man,Ai! Dios no me ama.
Grampa Simpson,Huh? I wanna see what's on the other broadcasts. Where's the oscillator on this thing?
Lisa Simpson,"No, Grampa, don't!"
Homer Simpson,Sit down! / You're breaking -- / Don't touch that--
Grampa Simpson,Consarn it! / What's this do? / --make my adjustments here--
,
Homer Simpson,Yay!! We're getting a new TV!!
Bart Simpson,Let's go to the Sharper Image. They've got a TV shaped like a Fifties diner!
Lisa Simpson,"No, let's go to the Nature Company. They've got a TV assembled by Hopi Indians!"
Marge Simpson,We can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. We just need a TV. We're going to go to the outlet mall in Ogdenville.
Lisa Simpson,
,
,
,
Women,
Homer Simpson,"Look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!"
Bart Simpson,"Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs."
Homer Simpson,"I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it. And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny."
Salesman,"Listen, I'm not going to lie to you: those are all superior machines. But if you like to watch your TV -- and I mean really watch it -- you want: the CarnivalÃ©. It features: two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well, durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart..."
Homer Simpson,"Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringin' in the pennies."
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Honey, I don't think these clothes are us..."
Lisa Simpson,Who are they?
Cletus Spuckler,"Hey, Brandine! You could wear this shirt to work."
Brandine Del Roy,"Oh, Cletus, you know I gotta wear the shirt what Dairy Queen give me."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Mom! There's something in here!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, it's beautiful. Can it be real Chanel?"
Marge Simpson,It is.
Marge Simpson,90 dollars?!
Lisa Simpson,"But it's marked down from $2,800!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, you look so sophisticated -- just like Mary Hart!"
Marge Simpson,"It fits like a dream, too. But we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain. It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me. If it were a suit we could all wear, maybe, then..."
Lisa Simpson,"C'mon, Mom, you never treat yourself to anything."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, sure I do. I treated myself to a Sanka not three days ago. But this is a real find."
Lisa Simpson,Just buy it. You don't have to rationalize everything.
Marge Simpson,"Alright, I will buy it. It'll be good for the economy."
,
Homer Simpson,You look great.
Marge Simpson,"Really? You like it? Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special."
Homer Simpson,Spurlock's Cafeteria it is.
Marge Simpson,What about the symphony -- or the theater?
,
Homer Simpson,What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
,
,
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today. Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the cash register? Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen? Look at the craziness."
Evelyn,"Attendant, I'd like some gas."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, I'm sorry, I do not speak English. Okay."
Evelyn,But you were just talking to --
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, yes! Hot dog! Hot dog! Yessir, no sir, maybe, okay!"
Evelyn,"Well, I can't pump it myself. I'm calling Triple-A."
Marge Simpson,"I used to be a little overwhelmed, too, but it's not that hard. I can show you."
Evelyn,"Marge? Is that you? Marge Bouvier, from high school?"
Marge Simpson,"yeah. Hi, Evelyn."
Evelyn,How about that. Marge. You look wonderful. And to think I heard you married Homer Simpson.
Marge Simpson,I did marry Homer.
Evelyn,Come. You must show me the pumps.
Marge Simpson,"Ninety percent of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem."
Evelyn,"Automotive skills and fashion sense. Well, you've come a long way from the girl I knew nothing about in high school."
Marge Simpson,"We ran with different crowds. You had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping, and I had my home shoe repair course."
Evelyn,"Oh, my, you haven't changed a bit as far as I know. Say, why don't you drop by the country club tomorrow?"
Evelyn,"Oh, and bring the family."
C. Montgomery Burns,You there -- fill it up with petroleum distillate and re-vulcanize my tyres! Post haste!
,
Marge Simpson,"Bart, comb your hair. Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie."
Homer Simpson,But Sipowicz does it.
Marge Simpson,"If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?"
Homer Simpson,I wish I was Sipowicz.
,
Lisa Simpson,Do I have to go? That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers.
Marge Simpson,"I've told you, I don't like you using the word hotbed. Please, Lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this. And everybody -- everybody, please -- be on your best behavior. Bart, no grifting."
Bart Simpson,"Aww, raspberries."
,
Guard,"Name, please?"
Homer Simpson,Simpson family.
Marge Simpson,We're not poor.
Marge Simpson,"Well, we're not."
Guard,Go on in. They're expecting you at the clubhouse.
Simpsons,
Bart Simpson,Wow. Livin' large!
Marge Simpson,"Ohhh. I've always dreamed of coming here. Everybody keep smiling, and I know we're going fit right in."
Krusty the Clown,Baaaahhhh!
Evelyn,"Oh, Marge, you made it. And you wore that lovely suit."
Evelyn,"Karen , Gillian , Elizabeth , Patricia , Roberta , Susan , meet Marge."
Women,
Marge Simpson,Pleased to meet you. You look like such a happy bunch... of people.
Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,That's the trouble with first impressions. You only get to make one.
Women,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that reminds me of a funny apron I saw..."
Evelyn,"Uh, you know, Marge, your family doesn't have to stand in the alcove."
Evelyn,They're free to enjoy the club.
Homer Simpson,"Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in."
Patricia,"Eliza-Beth is right. Why shout yourself hoarse at incompetent salesclerks, when you can get nearly everything mail-order?"
Evelyn,"Mmm-hmm, I won't eat anything unless it's shipped overnight from Vermont or Washington State."
Roberta,We order our steaks through The New Yorker.
Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,I have a sneaking suspicion that L.L. Bean and Eddie Bauer are selling me the same honey.
Marge Simpson,"I get food through the mail, but in a different way. Every month Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself."
Patricia,"Hmmm. That's very true, Marge. One night Wif and I came home late, and we decided not to wake Iris, and instead we microwaved our own soup."
Women,
Patricia,"Of course it was a horrible mess, but Iris didn't mind cleaning it up..."
Women,
Women,"Oh, that Iris is a gem. / Hooray for Wif! / Why can't my Thurston be more like Wif?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Didn't everybody have a wonderful time? I thought it was so opulent -- like the Playboy Mansion, but non-sexual."
Bart Simpson,"That place is weird. A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels, 'til I paid him to stop."
Homer Simpson,"You should've held out longer, boy."
Lisa Simpson,The rich are different from you and me.
Marge Simpson,"Yes. They're better. Socially better. And if we fit in, we can be better too. So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in. So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass. They might even ask us to join!"
Homer Simpson,"Boy, Marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, don't thank me. Thank my beautiful new suit."
,
Brittany Brockman,"Fritz, you idiot. I didn't order a bologna sandwich. I ordered an abalone sandwich."
Lisa Simpson,I don't know what Mom's thinking. This whole country club scene is so decadent...
Lisa Simpson,"All these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug, complacent parents. It just reinforces...the unspoken - class - system - of... horses - sitting - on - their - high... horses I'm sorry. I gotta go!"
,
Marge Simpson,Queen of Hearts. I believe all the rest are ours.
Roberta,Well played! We could have stopped them if you had changed to a different suit.
Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,"I thought perhaps changing suits had gone out of fashion... eh, Marge?"
Evelyn,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Tom Kite,"You know, Homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf is to lower your score."
Homer Simpson,That's one way.
Tom Kite,"I'm the club pro, Tom Kite. How 'bout I give you a few pointers on your game? Now you don't want to over-think..."
Homer Simpson,Not an issue.
Tom Kite,Keep your head down.
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Tom Kite,Pretend there's no one else here...and just go at your own pace.
Tom Kite,"Wow! Very impressive! You're a natural, Mr. Simpson."
Homer Simpson,Really?
Tom Kite,Uh-huh. All you need is your own set of clubs.
Tom Kite,And stay the hell out of my locker! You can keep the shoes.
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow."
Homer Simpson,"Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, Marge?"
,
Roberta,"Love your outfit, Marge. The vest says ""Let's have lunch,"" but the culottes say, ""You're paying!"""
Marge Simpson,"Why thank you, Roberta."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, look! I found something more fun than complaining!"
Evelyn,"Marge, your family is fitting in perfectly here. If all goes well at Saturday's ball, I'd love to sponsor you for membership."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that would be a dream come true. I'll be there with bells on!"
Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,Bells? Where exactly will you be attaching them to that mangled Chanel suit?
Women,
Evelyn,"Oh, don't worry, Marge. Her idea of wit is nothing more than an incisive observation humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable timing. I'm sure you'll be a smash at the ball and I just know you'll have a lovely new outfit."
,
Carl Carlson,"Hey, that's some mighty fine chippin', Homer."
Lenny Leonard,Yeah. Can ya bank it into the handicapped stall?
Homer Simpson,Seat down.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmmm. Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers?"
Waylon Smithers,"Homer Simpson, Sir. One of the fork- and-spoon operators from Sector 7G."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle. Perhaps I've finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns, eh?"
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, his waggle is no match for yours, Sir. I've never seen you lose a game...except for that one in '74 when you let Richard Nixon win. That was very kind of you, Sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his ""Oh, I can't go to prison, Monty! They'll eat me alive!"""
Waylon Smithers,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation?"
Waylon Smithers,"Unlikely, Sir. They spell and pronounce their names differently."
C. Montgomery Burns,Bah. Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for."
Marge Simpson,"All right, all right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your ""woo-hoos,"" please. We can't afford a single slip-up. They're judging us."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'Cause I heard--"
,
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"I don't know. Lisa, tonight is very important. Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons I like horses better than cars? One: a horse never--"
Marge Simpson,"I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa, would you mind--"
Lisa Simpson,You know how a horse goes like this? Mom? Like this? Mom?
Marge Simpson,"...I've already altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to..."
Lisa Simpson,Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
Marge Simpson,"LISA, PLEASE!!"
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,No-No-NO-NO-NOOO!
Marge Simpson,"At times like this, I guess all you can do is laugh."
,
Marge Simpson,I need a formal dress for tonight!
Patty Bouvier,You've come to the right place.
Selma Bouvier,We've got classy duds up the ying-yang.
Selma Bouvier,"I call this one ""Fantasy in Maroon."""
Patty Bouvier,"It's got some cigarette burns, but we can patch 'em up with Nu-Vinyl."
Marge Simpson,"Mmm, it's a bit peppery for me. Why don't we put this in the ""maybe"" pile."
Selma Bouvier,"This was originally a Halloween costume, but it found its way into my regular rotation."
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph."
Homer Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoooooooooo--
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. You're in deep ""D'oh"" now."
Waylon Smithers,"Perfect as always, Sir. Right on the green."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! The sand wedge!"
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're four strokes behind, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, a cunning stratagem, Sir. It's curving right toward the green... and... it's... there."
Homer Simpson,He got to the green in one shot?!
Homer Simpson,How - can - that - old - man - hit - SO - FAR?!!
Tom Kite,Now keep your head down... Ignore all distractions...
Krusty the Clown,
,
,
Marge Simpson,Miss... Miss! Do you have a Chanel suit or any other high-quality clothes?
Saleslady,"No, ma'am. But we do have a shipment of slightly burnt Sears Activewear coming in this afternoon."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I give up."
Cletus Spuckler,What time and how burnt?
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Cripes, man, can't you ever get to the green in less than two shots?"
Waylon Smithers,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, what are you doing up here?"
Homer Simpson,And what are you doing with his ball?
Homer Simpson,And all those other balls?!
Waylon Smithers,"There are no other balls. Uh, just these, uh, reptile eggs! Ooh, step away, they're endangered!"
Homer Simpson,"These aren't reptile eggs! You've been cheating! No matter where Mr. Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Cheating for me? Good lord, Smithers, that's patently unnecessary. I'm one of the world's finest golfers! In all the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a-- Oh."
Homer Simpson,So you're not the best golfer here! Wait'll I tell everyone about this! You stink!
Waylon Smithers,"You know, Homer, Mr. Burns holds a lot of sway at this club. If you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating, I'm sure he'd support your application for membership tonight."
Homer Simpson,Bull-honkey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.
C. Montgomery Burns,But does your wife?
Krusty the Clown,I knew my kind wasn't welcome here.
Bart Simpson,"Mom, you are lookin' fab-u-lous."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, you look great! You can do anything with that sewing machine."
Marge Simpson,"No, I can't. C'mon, let's go."
Lisa Simpson,You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it?
Marge Simpson,The outlet store.
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, two finds in one store! What are the odds?"
Marge Simpson,Call it fate. Let's go...
Lisa Simpson,How much did it cost?
Marge Simpson,A dollar. Let's go.
Lisa Simpson,With tax or without?
Marge Simpson,Without. Let me go!
Lisa Simpson,"So with tax, how much was it?"
Marge Simpson,Why do you have to question everything I do?!!
Lisa Simpson,"You look nice, is all."
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, what are you doing?"
Homer Simpson,I'm driving up to the main building. They've got valet parking tonight.
Marge Simpson,We can't drive this up there. They'll see the dent. They'll see the coat hanger antenna. Stop the car. We're walking.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
,
Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?"
Bart Simpson,I'm gonna pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money.
Lisa Simpson,"I'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names, or, in the case of butlers, their first."
Marge Simpson,"No, no, no! Not tonight! No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. Just be good."
Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'll behave."
Lisa Simpson,I won't say anything controversial.
Homer Simpson,"I just won't say anything, okay, honey?"
Homer Simpson,"You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are."
Marge Simpson,"Come here, Maggie."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity. I like the way Lisa speaks her mind. I like Bart's... I like Bart. And I like my old green dress. I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown."
Homer Simpson,Our savings?!
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, I saved the receipt. We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel."
Homer Simpson,"They have beer and gum, right?"
Marge Simpson,"C'mon, let's go. I wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member."
Lisa Simpson,It's okay. Those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
Evelyn,I wonder where Marge could be? She's missing her own initiation.
Dorothy Parker-ish Socialite,I hope she didn't take my attempt to destroy her too seriously.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Where's Homer? Oh, and to think I spent all afternoon baking him this cake."
C. Montgomery Burns,I pickled the figs myself.
,
Employee,"Hey, did you guys just come from the prom?"
Bart Simpson,Sort of.
Marge Simpson,"But, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this."
Employee,"Man, you're crazy! This place is a dump."
,
Mr. Dewey,"May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing of your Great Aunt Hortense. As her only living heirs, you stand to inherit her entire estate."
Homer Simpson,Poor Aunt Hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...
Mr. Dewey,The only stipulation is that you spend one night in a haunted house.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, isn't that somewhat unusual?"
Mr. Dewey,"No, it's a standard clause."
Homer Simpson,"Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts."
,
Homer Simpson,"Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts."
Homer Simpson,Best night's sleep I ever had.
Lisa Simpson,Their tap water tasted better than ours!
Mr. Dewey,"Here you go. One hundred dollars each... The rest goes to Ann Landers, as was stipulated in your aunt's will."
Lisa Simpson,
Mr. Dewey,"Oh, I'm sorry, I must have continued talking after you left the office. I do that sometimes."
,
Marge Simpson,"What are you going to spend your money on, kids?"
Bart Simpson,There's a special on tacos down at the The TacoMat. A hundred tacos for a hundred dollars. I'm gonna get that.
Lisa Simpson,I'm going to contribute my money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Marge Simpson,Tacos! Public Broadcasting! I won't have you kids throwing your money away like that. You're both coming downtown with me and you're gonna put that money in the bank.
,
Bart Simpson,"Boy, I sure could go for a hundred tacos right about now."
Marge Simpson,No.
Comic Book Guy,"Yes, this should provide adequate sustenance for the ""Dr. Who"" marathon."
,
Marge Simpson,You'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of professionals.
Teller,"Ook, ook. Are you folks ready to go ape?"
Lisa Simpson,Mom?
Marge Simpson,A professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
Bank Employee,... and you'll find that saving for your future is far more thrilling than any rollercoaster.
Bart Simpson,"Really?! Wow, I should've started a long time ago!"
Bank Employee,Mmm-hmm. Now fill out these forms. I'm sure you'll find them more exciting than a weekend with Batman.
,
Lisa Simpson,I got their new Thrifty Saver Savings account. 2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25. So a year from now I'll have an extra nickel.
Bart Simpson,I got the account where you get free customized checks. I chose the Hindenberg flip-book series.
Bart Simpson,Coooool.
Marge Simpson,"Checking accounts aren't really for children, Bart."
Krusty the Clown,
,
Bart Simpson,"No, Mom, I can handle it. Let's see... Pay to the order of... Lisa. One cent... and no cents. And now the old John Hancock... Here you go."
Lisa Simpson,Thank you.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"A million dollars! Thanks, Bart! I owe you one."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, that's a post-dated check, remember. Don't cash it 'til the year ten thousand."
Milhouse Van Houten,Okay.
,
Jimbo Jones,"Excellent. As soon as the check clears, I'll let you go."
,
Kids,"Can I get your autograph, Krusty? / Me first! / Me third! / etc."
Krusty the Clown,That's it. No more autographs. I gotta go. They're naming a new sandwich after me at my restaurant.
Bart Simpson,
Milhouse Van Houten,"It's okay, Bart. You can share mine."
Milhouse Van Houten,Quick -- press against me while the ink's still wet!
Bart Simpson,No need. I'm going to get Krusty's autograph the easy way.
Bart Simpson,"If he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing it on the back. Then when my monthly bank statement comes, I'll get the check back complete with autograph. No fuss, no muss."
Milhouse Van Houten,That's a good plan. But it won't impress girls like this.
Girls,Ewwww!
Milhouse Van Houten,
,
Bart Simpson,"Lisa's autograph... Apu's autograph... Oh, whaddaya know, Jimbo's real name is Corky... Aannnnd Krusty... Hey! ""Cayman Islands Offshore Holding Corporation""?"
,
Bart Simpson,Krusty was supposed to sign this. Take it back and make him sign it.
Teller #2,"Uh, no, no. Stamping the back of a check is perfectly legal, little boy. Many people do it to save time. You see in this case, instead of writing out his name, Krusty has stamped the name of his Cayman Islands holding corporation on... Hmm... excuse me a minute..."
Announcer,The Internal Revenue Service presents Herschel Krustofsky's Clown-related Entertainment Show.
,
Krusty the Clown,Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey! I bought this popcorn fair and square!
Teller #2,"Sorry, the bank is close-- Oh, kid, gosh, I meant to tell you: Turns out that Krusty is one of the biggest tax cheats in history. And they nailed him, all thanks to you."
Bart Simpson,
Teller #2,"Some might say you're a hero, kid. Not me, however. I love Krusty."
,
Kent Brockman,"Ladies and gentlemen: Krusty the Clown!... was arrested today for massive tax fraud. Krusty's years of tax avoision would never have -- ""Avoision"" -- it's a crime. Look it up! ... would never have... I don't say ""evasion,"" I say ""avoision."" ... would never have come to light if not for a crafty little boy named Bart Simpson."
Bart Simpson,Krusty's my hero! How could I do this to him?
Lisa Simpson,"It is a tragedy for all us kids. But, Bart, you can't beat yourself up."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, there'll be enough people to do that for me at recess tomorrow."
,
,
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, I can't go to jail! I got a swanky lifestyle! I'm used to the best!"
Chief Agent,"Krusty, this is America. We don't send our celebrities to jail. We're just going to garnish your salary."
Krusty the Clown,Garnish my celery?
Chief Agent,"Please Krusty, no jokes."
Krusty the Clown,"Who's joking?!! Oh, I don't know what you're saying! It all sounds so crazy to me!!"
2ND IRS AGENT,It simply means we'll be taking part of your salary until your debt is repaid. Say 75% for forty years.
Krusty the Clown,But I don't plan to live that long!
Chief Agent,"Well, then, we'd better make it 95%."
Krusty the Clown,
,
All,"Goodnight, Moe!"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, hey, kids! Now that the Feds are calling the shots, this show's gotta be a lot more cost-effective. So we had to cut down on the frills -- like sets, props, costumes, and Sideshow Mel. But that doesn't mean we can't have fun. For example... I sure wish somebody would give me a banana cream pie... Yeah?!..."
Krusty the Clown,"I guess we can't afford pies right now. Well, throw something!"
Krusty the Clown,
,
Homer Simpson,"Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers, one IRS-Wich -- withhold the lettuce -- three dependent-sized sodas and a FICAccino."
Squeaky-Voiced Teen,Fill out schedule B. You should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks.
Homer Simpson,Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
Marge Simpson,Seven hundred dollars.
,
Krusty the Clown,"They took my money, they wrecked my show, they buried a bunch of stinking veterans in my family plot -- but at least I still got my memories. Those are locked up safe in my fabulous mansion."
,
Auctioneer,And now lot number 66: a handmade leather suitcase. Carried by the Krustofsky family upon their arrival at Ellis Island in 1902. A priceless heirloom and historic piece of Krustiana. What am I bid?
Selma Bouvier,40 cents!
Auctioneer,I got 40 cents... Sold for 40 cents!
Krusty the Clown,"40 cents? Ach, my Grampa Zev would turn over in his grave if it wasn't filled with some veteran!"
Auctioneer,Lot 67: 32 cartons of pornography.
Jasper Beardly,10 cents!
Phone Bid Taker,12!
Auctioneer,12 cents to our phone bidder in Japan. Any advance?
Jasper Beardly,All I brought is a dime. I didn't know there'd be pornography.
Auctioneer,Sold for 12 cents.
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, my beloved pornography! I can't watch this anymore. I'm going to bed."
Auctioneer,How much for Krusty's bed?
Moe Szyslak,Half a buck!
Auctioneer,Sold.
Moe Szyslak,"Goodnight, everybody!"
Auctioneer,"And now, lot 2,380: Krusty's private plane, the ""I'M-ON-A-ROLLA GAY."""
Krusty the Clown,"But I love that plane! I used to fly to Vegas in it with Dean Martin. One night he looked out the window and the moon hit his eye like a big pizza pie. We wrote a song about it, but it ended up infringing on one he recorded years before."
Patty Bouvier,"Hey, Selma, that plane would go great with your new suitcase."
Selma Bouvier,Nah. I just bought it to soak my feet in.
Selma Bouvier,
Bart Simpson,Krusty? Hi. Is it okay if I sit down here?
Krusty the Clown,"Go ahead, kid. Knock yourself out."
Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, Krusty. But, you know, my mom says God never closes a door without opening a window."
Krusty the Clown,"No offense, kid, but your mom's a dingbat. There's no silver lining here. I was a big cheese -- a huge cheese! But now look at me! I gotta ride the bus like a schnook! I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot! I gotta wait in line with nobodies to buy groceries from a failure!"
Bart Simpson,"It doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong. As long as you're on TV, people will respect you."
Krusty the Clown,"Respect?! What good is respect without the moolah to back it up? Everywhere I go I see teachers in Ferraris, research scientists drinking champagne. I tried to drink a Coke on the bus and they took away my pass! That's no life for a famous clown!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, if it'll make you feel any better, Krusty, you can punch me in the face."
Krusty the Clown,"Nah, forget it. Go home, kid."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Shiva H. Vishnu! Where is that noise coming from?
Krusty the Clown,
,
Man's Voice,"I must say, I've had a lovely evening, Agnes. I don't suppose I could come in for a cup of--"
Agnes Skinner,Seymour!
Seymour Skinner,Mother?! Superintendent Chalmers?!!
Gary Chalmers,Skinner!
Seymour Skinner,What I wouldn't give for something to interrupt this awkward moment.
Krusty the Clown,
Seymour Skinner,That'll do nicely.
,
Krusty the Clown,
Lisa Simpson,You gotta hand it to Krusty.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans."
Homer Simpson,Wow.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, that's my Krusty. I got a feeling he'll be allll-right."
,
Lisa Simpson,Oh my God! Krusty's shoes!
Chief Wiggum,"Okay, folks, show's over. Nothing to see here, show's... Oh my God! A horrible plane crash! Hey everybody, get a load of this flaming wreckage! Come on, crowd around, crowd around! Don't be shy, crowd around!"
Chief Wiggum,Ladies and gentlemen... Krusty the Clown is dead!
,
Bart Simpson,I can't believe Krusty is really gone.
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in Heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin... I wish I were dead."
Troy McClure,"We're gathered to mourn the passing of Herschel Shmoikel Krustofsky, beloved entertainer and dear friend. Hello, I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such show business funerals as ""Andre the Giant, We Hardly Knew Ye,"" and ""Shemp Howard: Today We Mourn a Stooge."" Now... Krusty's closest friend and sidekick, Sideshow Mel."
Sideshow Mel,"I'll miss you, Krusty -- I and all the other Sideshows... except Sideshow Bob. But in the midst of our sorrow, we can take comfort in the fact that your elevated blood alcohol level probably helped you burn up quicker. Since you left us no earthly remains, it is my sad duty to unveil this simple memorial."
Troy McClure,Next in our cavalcade of celebrity mourners: Bob Newhart.
Bob Newhart,"See... to tell you the truth, I'm just... I'm killing time here, I was waiting for uh, for a different funeral to start."
Troy McClure,I'll handle it. Bob Newhart everybody!
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death. Would it help if I told you you're not responsible for Krusty's death?"
Bart Simpson,Yes. Yes it would.
Bob Newhart,"Uh... um, though I started my career several years before uh, Krusty, so I could never really have learned anything directly from him, still... I think... in a way, in a very meaningful way, that I... all of us... have learned from him. in that is... by being a clown on television for so many years... even though you know, many of us, we didn't watch his show... Thank you."
Troy McClure,"Well, that's the funeral, folks. We'll be sitting shiva at the Friar's Club at 7 p.m. and again at 10. You must be over 18 for the 10 o'clock -- It gets a little blue."
,
Kent Brockman,And so Herschel Krustofsky is gone. But not forgotten. Today was the unveiling of the new Krusty stamp. Postal patrons were asked to choose between two competing designs: One of Krusty's heartwarming smile... and one of his fiery death.
Kent Brockman,"By a nearly 2 to 1 vote, the smiling Krusty was chosen."
,
Homer Simpson,"Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy. People die all the time. Just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night."
Bart Simpson,Krusty!
Bart Simpson,Mom! I just saw Krusty!
Marge Simpson,"Yes, dear. In your mind."
Bart Simpson,"No, on the street."
Marge Simpson,On the street in your mind.
Bart Simpson,Why won't you believe me?!
Marge Simpson,"Sweetheart, maybe you just want Krusty to be alive so badly, you think you see him everywhere. I went through the same thing when Lyndon Johnson died."
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,...and these pills will help with the queasiness.
Bart Simpson,"Krusty?! Doctor Hibbert, who was that man?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now Bart, telling you would violate the patient/doctor privilege, just as if I were to tell you that Jaspser here has five seconds to live."
Jasper Beardly,What'd he say?
Mrs. Glick,He said I'm next!
,
Bart Simpson,Am I going crazy? I'm seeing Krusty everywhere.
,
Marge Simpson,Ye olde toast.
Lisa Simpson,Well I can't. You'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.
Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute! All those things I saw -- there's a connection! The truck full of nets and buckets, the queasy guy, the lobsters... they all point to one thing. Follow me."
,
,
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arrr, I've got some customers. Call me back, Ishmael. Ahoy there, minnows."
Bart Simpson,Ahoy! Have you seen this man?
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arrr, that's Handsome Pete. He dances for nickels. Pete! Ye got some customers!"
Lisa Simpson,"No. We're looking for this man, Krusty the Clown."
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Narrr, narrr, narrr."
Lisa Simpson,"It's hopeless, Bart. We've searched up and down these docks, from Pier One to that Pier 1 by Pier Seventeen."
Bart Simpson,"Lisa! Look! A signature with stars around it, just like Krusty's!"
Lisa Simpson,"""Rory B. Bellows, Slip Eight!"" Let's go!"
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Not a quarter!! Arrr, he'll be dancing for hours!"
,
Bart Simpson,Are you Rory B. Bellows?
Rory,Yes.
Bart Simpson,How about Krusty the Clown?
Rory,Sorry. I don't do impressions.
Bart Simpson,"Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him?"
Rory,"I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you. And I've got a lot of corroborating evidence... over here... by the throttle."
Rory,
Rory,"You know, you two coulda said something 'steada letting me make an ass of myself."
Lisa Simpson,Hey! You've got a pacemaker scar just like Krusty!
Bart Simpson,And Krusty's superfluous third nipple!
Rory,"Why won't you leave me alone, kid? Can't you see I don't want to be Krusty anymore? That's why I faked my death."
Lisa Simpson,But we saw your plane crash...
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, but I wasn't in it..."
Krusty the Clown,"Just before I hit the mountain, I jumped out of the plane into a carefully placed net."
Krusty the Clown,
Bart Simpson,"So now that we've blown your cover, I guess you've gotta come back and do your show again!"
Lisa Simpson,Or kill us.
Bart Simpson,
Krusty the Clown,"I won't be coming back, kids. I've got a sweet life here. The sea air is clearing my lungs, the sun is toasting my pale skin a healthy brown, and most important, I learned that I don't need money to be happy. All that high living just distracted me from my true calling in life: salvaging sunken barges for scrap iron. Sorry, kids, there's nothing left for me on dry land anymore."
Bart Simpson,"But Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to brighten up their afternoons? Are you going to turn your back on them?"
Krusty the Clown,Yes.
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, Lis, Krusty doesn't want our attention anymore. Let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity."
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Krusty doesn't want to be a clown. He's happy just being another blue-collar bozo."
Krusty the Clown,Meh.
Bart Simpson,"Krusty's tired of having phonies around, pretending to be his friends. I'm sure he'll find plenty of people who'll like him for who he is."
Krusty the Clown,It could happen. Who needs friends? The incessant beep of the Global Positioning System is all the companionship I need.
GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM,
Krusty the Clown,
Krusty the Clown,"Tell me where you are now, you bastard!"
Krusty the Clown,"All right, I admit it. I miss the phonies -- but that's all I miss. That and the Shirley Jones/Marty Engles New Years Eve Party."
Lisa Simpson,What about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people?
Bart Simpson,"What about: being an illiterate TV clown who's still more respected than all the scientists, doctors and educators in the country put together?"
Krusty the Clown,"Yeahhhh, I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect while I'm out here on some stinkin' tub."
Krusty the Clown,"That's just what those eggheads want. Well, forget it, Poindexter, 'cause Krusty's back in town!"
Lisa Simpson,Yay!
,
Bart Simpson,"So Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problem?"
Krusty the Clown,"Don't sweat it. The life of ""Rory B. Bellows"" is insured for a surprisingly large amount."
Krusty the Clown,
Narrator,1796. A fiercely determined band of pioneers leaves Maryland after misinterpreting a passage in the Bible. Their destination: New Sodom. This is their story.
Milhouse Van Houten,This is going to be great!
Bart Simpson,"I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the Indians for corn, and then the Indians shot them and took the corn."
Pioneers,"Egad, a monster! / It's a horrible fiend! / It's some sort of land cow!"
Troy-jebediah,"Stand back, fellow settlers."
Pioneers,
Fatherly Pioneer,Ye've saved our fledgling community!
Little Kid,"Mr. Springfield, how can I hope to achieve such greatness?"
Troy-jebediah,A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.
Kids,"Springfield rules! / Way to go, Springfield! / Etc."
Edna Krabappel,"""Embiggens."" Hmm, I never heard that word before I moved to Springfield."
Miss Hoover,I don't know why. It's a perfectly cromulent word.
Seymour Skinner,"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Those tall ships really lifted the nation's spirits after Watergate.
,
Miss Hoover,"To celebrate our bicentennial, all twenty of you will write an essay about Jebediah Springfield, and the best eighteen will be put on file in the school library, available to anyone who requests them."
Ralph Wiggum,Can we do illustrations?
Miss Hoover,No.
,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. Look, I can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier... an apprentice! I think I'll be an apprentice, Marge."
Marge Simpson,What kind of apprentice?
Homer Simpson,That's for my master to decide.
Lisa Simpson,How about town crier? You'd be great at that.
Homer Simpson,You think so?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Dad! You're a big fat loudmouth. And you can walk when you have to."
Homer Simpson,"Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot."
,

Mechanical Voice,"Dangerous river crossings threatened life and limb, but helped our founding fathers save on bridge tolls."
Lisa Simpson,
HURLBUT,"Excuse me. I didn't mean to startle you, but I do love to talk Jebediah. Even when I'm drinking my chicory."
HURLBUT,"I'm the curator, Hollis Hurlbut."
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, I'm Lisa Simpson. I'm here to research a report on Jebediah."
HURLBUT,"Oh, you're in for a treat. You know, some historians consider Jebediah Springfield a minor patriot. But I think you'll find he's easily the equal of William Dawes or even Samuel Otis."
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Congratulations, Ned, you are our new town crier."
Homer Simpson,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"May your shrill, nasal voice ring throughout our streets and brains."
Ned Flanders,"Thankily-dank, Mayor, I shan't disappoint. Har ye, har ye! I declare myself pickled tink about Springfield's Bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial Day!"
Homer Simpson,"You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!"
Homer Simpson,Hear ye! Hear ye! Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! Chooseth Homer Simpson and he shalt rock thy world!
Committee Members,
Chief Wiggum,"Good God, he is fabulous!"
Seymour Skinner,He's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance!
Lisa Simpson,"I was right about Jebediah, and now I can prove it."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Top-notch criering, I admit. But the hat and bell belong to Flanders, so no dice."
Ned Flanders,"Aw, they're just family heirlooms. That shouldn't stand in the way of Homer takin' my job and--"
Homer Simpson,"Less chat, more hat."
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Hear ye! Hear ye! The Homer Broadcasting System is on the air! All hollering, all the time! I'm gonna make the..."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"You're to restrict your cryering to the parade, and selected pre-approved publicity events."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Wow!
HURLBUT,Excuse me. My microwave johnnycakes are ready.
Lisa Simpson,"The Secret Confessions of Jebediah Springfield? ""Know ye who read this: there is more to my life than history records."""
Jebediah Springfield,"Firstly, I did not tame the legendary buffalo. It was already tame. I merely shot it. Secondly, I have not always been known as Jebediah Springfield. Until 1796, I was Hans SprÃ¼ngfeld, murderous pirate. And the half-wits of this town will never learn the truth. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha--"
Lisa Simpson,"--ha ha ha ha ha. Oh my God! Our town hero is a fraud! ""I write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria."""
Lisa Simpson,
HURLBUT,Heeere's johnnycakes! Is everything okay? You look a bit flushed.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, it's just the excitement of studying Jebediah."
HURLBUT,"Sounds like you've come down with a serious case of ""Jebeditis."""
Lisa Simpson,Just when I was getting over my Chester A. Arthritis.
HURLBUT,You had arthritis?
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, no."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, hear ye! What's for breakfast?"
Marge Simpson,Toast.
Homer Simpson,"I don't understand thee, Marge."
Lisa Simpson,What would you say if I told you Jebediah Springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? Look.
Lisa Simpson,Jebediah was really a vicious pirate named Hans SprÃ¼ngfeld. His tongue was bitten off by a Turk in a grog house fight!
Homer Simpson,"No tongue, eh? How did he talk and eat and laugh and love?"
Lisa Simpson,He had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
Homer Simpson,"Yes, that'd do."
Lisa Simpson,He was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. He even tried to kill George Washington!
Homer Simpson,The dastard!
SprÃ¼ngfeld,Gimme all your money!
Washington,Never!
Washington,
SprÃ¼ngfeld,
SprÃ¼ngfeld,
Betsy Ross,"I got the white stars you wanted, but I couldn't find any red hearts, yellow moons, or green clovers."
Washington,"Well, I'll use it, but I'm not paying for it."
Lisa Simpson,"The next time Hans SprÃ¼ngfeld was seen, he had changed his name to Jebediah Springfield."
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in Springfield or Stenchburg. You know why they chose Springfield? Because everyone knows Jebediah Springfield was a true American hero. End of story."
Homer Simpson,"I believe you, honey."
Lisa Simpson,You do?
Homer Simpson,"Of course I do. You're always right about this type of thing, and for once, I want in on the ground floor."
Lisa Simpson,"Aw, thanks, Dad."
,
Miss Hoover,"Ralph, A. Janey, A. And Lisa, for your essay, ""Jebediah Springfield: Superfraud,"" F."
Lisa Simpson,But it's all true!
Miss Hoover,This is nothing but dead white male bashing from a P.C. thug. It's women like you who keep the rest of us from landing a husband.
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, nice talking to you."
Homer Simpson,Lisa?
Lisa Simpson,Miss Hoover thought I made the whole thing up. She called me a P.C. thug.
,
Homer Simpson,"I've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. So here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat."
Lisa Simpson,"That won't help, Dad. No one's ever going to believe me."
Homer Simpson,But you have proof! We could go get that confession out of Jebediah's fife.
Lisa Simpson,We could?
Homer Simpson,"Come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case."
Lisa Simpson,No baseball bat.
Homer Simpson,

Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Mr. Hurlbut."
HURLBUT,"Oh, you're back. And you've brought a friend."
Homer Simpson,"Town Crier. I'd like to ask you a few questions. One: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife."
HURLBUT,"Hey, stop! I've got nothing but respect for the office of town crier, but this is well outside your jurisdiction."
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, put this in your fife and smoke it!"
HURLBUT,What the...?
Lisa Simpson,That's Jebediah's secret confession. It proves he was a fraud.
HURLBUT,
HURLBUT,"I think, Lisa, that you've been taken in by an obvious forgery. Unfortunately, historical research is plagued by this sort of hoax. This so-called ""Confession"" is just as phony as the Howard Hughes will, the Hitler Diaries, or the Emancipation Retraction."
Lisa Simpson,But it explains why there's no record of Jebediah before 1795! He was Hans SprÃ¼ngfeld until then!
HURLBUT,That's preposterous! Now get out -- you're banned from this Historical Society! You and your children and your childrens' children! For three months.

,
Lisa Simpson,I'm not going to give up. I refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth.
,
Lisa Simpson,"I'd like 25 copies on goldenrod, 25 on canary, 25 on saffron, and 25 on paella."
Wiseguy,"Okay, one hundred yellow."
Lisa Simpson,"You don't have to help me with this, Dad."
C. Montgomery Burns,Go! Go!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure I do. I always believe in helping the little guy, and you're the littlest guy I know."
Comic Book Guy,Question: is your name Ridley Scott or James Cameron?
Homer Simpson,"No, it's Homer."
Comic Book Guy,"Well, then I will thank you to stop peering at my screenplay, ""Homer."" And if I see a movie where computers threaten our personal liberties, I will know that you stole my idea."
Homer Simpson,I'm just waitin' for my kid.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Apu. Can I put this poster in your window?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, of course you can, you little pixie! Woo! You are just as sweet as the stix which bear your name."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Take that down! As a semi-legal immigrant, your poster could land me in a predicament as red-hot as the candies which bear that name."
Lisa Simpson,He wouldn't let me put it up.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. I know a much better way to get attention..."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield."
Barflies,
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, the little cutie wants to do something cute... Shut up, ya bums, shut up! Go ahead, angel."
Lisa Simpson,"Jebediah Springfield was nothing more than an evil, blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town!"
Moe Szyslak,"Good God. Homer, y'know I support most any prejudice you can name, but your hero-phobia sickens me. You and your daughter ain't welcome here no more. Barney, show 'em the exit."
Barney Gumble,There's an exit?
Moe Szyslak,"""Evil blood-thirsty pirate""... Hello, Town Jubilation Committee? I got something that's going to make you a lot less jubilant."
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Can't you understand, little girl? Jebediah was no criminal."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,That's right. The reason they say he had a silver tongue is because he was such a fine speaker.
Lisa Simpson,That's a myth that got mixed up with the truth.
Bart Simpson,Yes.
Mayor Joe Quimby,You are tampering with forces you can't understand. We have major corporations sponsoring this event.
Lisa Simpson,I hope you know you're sponsoring a celebration for a murderous pirate!
Corporate Type,"A pirate?! Well, that's hardly the image we want for Long John Silver's!"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I see no way of settling this. I say we imprison them for the duration of our Bicentennial."
Lisa Simpson,"There is one way: get the silver tongue. If Jebediah's who I say he is, then it should still be in his grave."
Committee Members,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, yes, but human decency prevents--"
Homer Simpson,"DIG HIM UP! Dig up that corpse!! If you really love Jebediah Springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!"
Homer Simpson,Dig up his grave! Pull out his tongue!
Mayor Joe Quimby,Can't we have one meeting that doesn't end with us digging up a corpse?
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Now, Lisa, when you see there's no silver tongue in there, will you stop trying to ruin Jebediah's reputation?"
Lisa Simpson,Yes.
Homer Simpson,What do we win if the tongue is there?
Mayor Joe Quimby,Credibility.
Homer Simpson,What a jip.
Crowd,
Crowd,
Chief Wiggum,Jebediah Springfield has been replaced with a skeleton!
HURLBUT,No. That's the skeleton of Jebediah.
Chief Wiggum,"Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, ah, well, let's start looking for that silver tongue."
Lisa Simpson,"Don't forget to look in his shoes. When I lose something, sometimes it turns up in my shoes."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Actually, if it's anywhere, it would be lodged in the sinus."
Chief Wiggum,"Alright, here goes... Forgive us, Jebediah, we mean no disrespect."
Chief Wiggum,"Well, that settles that. There is no silver tongue. Is there, Bonesy?"
Skull,"Oh, I wish, Chief! With that kinda dough, I could buy me some eyeballs! Ha ha ha!"
Chief Wiggum,"That's the spirit, Bonesy. Why don't you sing a song for the nice people?"
,
Lisa Simpson,I was so sure...
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home."
Chief Wiggum,"Not so fast, Simpson. This foul business was all your fault."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"By the power vested in me, I hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell--"
Homer Simpson,No! Nooooooo!!
Mayor Joe Quimby,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"You will have the hat cleaned, and then return it."
,
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Dad, I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted to be in the parade."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
Lisa Simpson,
Jebediah Springfield,Why did you dig up the bones of the past? Why did you disturb the ghosts of history?
Lisa Simpson,I-I-I...
Lisa Simpson,General Washington?!
Washington,"You did some good work exposing Jebediah, Lisa. Don't stop now. There's just one piece left in the puzzle."
Lisa Simpson,"But I've caused so much trouble already, General Washington. I can't go on."
Washington,"We had quitters in the Revolution, too. We called them ""Kentuckians."" Well, I'll just have to find another little girl to be President. What's your friend Janey's number?"
Lisa Simpson,No! Not Janey! She'll pack the Supreme Court with boys!
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, let me help you, George Washington, I still want to help you."
Bart Simpson,"""I want to help you, George Washington?"" Even your dreams are square."
,
Ralph Wiggum,"Can you open my milk, Mommy?"
Miss Hoover,"I'm not Mommy, Ralph. I'm Miss Hoover."
Kids,
Lisa Simpson,The missing piece of the puzzle... I've got it!
,
HURLBUT,You!? What are you doing here?
C. Montgomery Burns,Slow down!
HURLBUT,"Oh, please, not that claptrap again. Haven't you hurt Jebediah enough with your childish tales of pirate ships and fisticuffs and a silver tongue that can't be found?"
Lisa Simpson,That's because you stole it!
HURLBUT,"That's a lie! I'm an antiquarian, dammit! It's my job to seek out the truth!"
Lisa Simpson,"But when you found the truth, you couldn't take it! You couldn't stand that you'd devoted your life to a fraud! So you covered it up! Didn't you? Didn't you?!"
HURLBUT,"No! No, tha... that's preposterous... I... I mean I couldn't... You... you can't..."
Lisa Simpson,Stop it! Where's the silver tongue?!
HURLBUT,I thought no one would ever find it.
HURLBUT,"When I pried open the coffin, it was there: that shiny tongue, sticking out of his mouth, razzing my entire career, my... my life. Before the dust could settle, I pocketed it. But I thought I had you fooled."
Lisa Simpson,You did. Until I realized that Jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to.
Lisa Simpson,How else could he have gotten this?
HURLBUT,SprÃ¼ngfeld must have taken it with him when he ran off after the fight...
Lisa Simpson,Exactly.
HURLBUT,"This celebration is a sham and it's all my fault. We've got to get the word out to every man, woman and child in town."
,
HURLBUT,Stop! Stop everything! Stop the parade!
Barney Gumble,What?
Moe Szyslak,What's going on here?
Seymour Skinner,This is highly unorthodox!
HURLBUT,This is Lisa Simpson. She's discovered something very important about Jebediah Springfield that you need to hear.
Lisa Simpson,"People of Springfield, I, uh, I don't know quite how to say this..."
Mrs. Glick,"Don't be shy, little girl. Think of Jebediah, and the words'll come."
Lisa Simpson,I did a lot of research on Jebediah Springfield and...
Sharpshooter,I think I can pick her off.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Wait, let's see what she has to say."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
Waylon Smithers,"But what would you do without me, Sir?"
Lisa Simpson,"Jebediah Springfield was... Jebediah was... great. I, um, just wanted to say that I've done some research and, uh, he was great."
Crowd,Well said! / Great speech! / Jebediah would be proud of you.
HURLBUT,Why didn't you tell them?
Lisa Simpson,"Because the myth of Jebediah has value, too. It's brought out the best in everyone in this town. Regardless of who said it, ""a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, hey, it's Homer! Good to see ya, neighb--"
Homer Simpson,Get lost!
Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, HEAR YE, HEAR YE!!"
Helen Lovejoy,He is not the official town crier! Police! Do something!
Chief Wiggum,"Well, I'd like to, ma'am, but he's too damn good. Let him march, boys. Let the man march."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Testing... Testing for Mr. Burns. Here you go, Sir. I've warmed up the crowd for you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome employees! ""Come in!"" ""The whole night's entertainment is on me"" -- ""Monty Burns!"""
Employees,
Announcer,Welcome to an evening of exciting quarter mile action !
Announcer,"Our first race is a benefit for daredevil Lance Murdock , who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver !"
Homer Simpson,All right! Liver!
Marge Simpson,"Boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? I'd be a real hot-rod mama, wouldn't I? Huh? Huh?"
Bart Simpson,"You missed the race, mama."
Marge Simpson,I wish I'd pay more attention.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger or ""funkier."""
Waylon Smithers,"I'll switch to the tablespoon, Sir."
Announcer,"Coming up next, our feature race: The Nuclear Power Plant Championship ."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, at last! Smithers, fetch the bi-oculars."
C. Montgomery Burns,Damnation! Tell them to go slower!
Waylon Smithers,Yes sir.
Waylon Smithers,"Hi, guys. Could we keep it in first gear for a couple of laps?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, this novelty foam hand is ludicrously oversized. Go swap it for a smaller one."
Waylon Smithers,"It is a bit ostentatious, Sir. I'll be right back."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Burnsie! Ha! -- This was some swell shindig. Thank you very much."
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! What's happening?!
Lenny Leonard,I had a great time and... and I just want to shake your hand...
Lenny Leonard,You're the greatest!
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! Help!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers!
Waylon Smithers,Oh my God!
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"You should've seen the murderous glint in his eye, Smithers. And his breath reeked of beer and pretzeld bread."
Waylon Smithers,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. This was all my fault."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't concern yourself. If things had turned ugly I always had my mace."
Waylon Smithers,"Don't let me off the hook that easily, Sir. I failed you and I'll never forgive myself. Never! Never! Never!"
C. Montgomery Burns,
Waylon Smithers,Never! Never! Never!
,
Waylon Smithers,"Good morning, Sir. To make up for my failure last night, I've alphabetized your breakfast. You can start with the waffles, and work your way up to the zwieback. And to prevent newsprint from rubbing off on your hands, I've laminated today's newspaper."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How am I supposed to do the ""Junior Jumble?"""
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, I can't even grovel properly! I'm a buffoon! I don't deserve to live on your planet anymore!"
Waylon Smithers,Huh?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Pull yourself together, man! I dare say you're in need of a long vacation."
Waylon Smithers,"No! Don't make me take a vacation! Without you, I'll wither and die."
C. Montgomery Burns,That's a risk I'm willing to take.
C. Montgomery Burns,Tchah! I'm not a baby who needs a nursemaid to burp me. You see? Now I insist you take a vacation just as soon as a temporary substitute can be found.
C. Montgomery Burns,
Waylon Smithers,"I've got to find a replacement who won't outshine me. Perhaps if I search the employee evaluations for the word ""incompetent..."""
Waylon Smithers,"714 names! Huh. Better be more specific. ""Lazy"", ""Clumsy"", ""Dimwitted"", ""Monstrously Ugly""."
Waylon Smithers,"Aw, nuts to this. I'll just go get Homer Simpson."
,
Homer Simpson,I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.
Lisa Simpson,"You know, Dad, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
Marge Simpson,"You know, Homer, assisting Mr. Burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
Lisa Simpson,Mo-omm! I just said that!
Marge Simpson,Sor-ry. Next time get your own darned corn.
,
Homer Simpson,"Um, is this the chair I'll be sitting on?"
Waylon Smithers,"Yah. Now I realize caring for Mr. Burns seems like a big job, but actually it's just 2800 small jobs."
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?"
Waylon Smithers,"Your new duties will include answering Mr. Burns' phone, preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting with his chewing and swallowing, lying to Congress, and some light typing."
Waylon Smithers,"Montgomery Burns' office... Oh, hello Mrs. Burns... I'll see if your son is available."
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns has a mother!? She must be a hundred million years old!
Waylon Smithers,She has limited capacities. All she can do is dial and yell.
Waylon Smithers,"I'm sorry, Monty can't come to the phone right now. He's in a very important meeting and can't be disturbed."
C. Montgomery Burns,
C. Montgomery Burns,Dough-nuts?! I told you I don't like ethnic food!
C. Montgomery Burns,Here. Tell me how my stocks did yesterday.
Waylon Smithers,"Uh-huh... Okay, I'll give him the message. Mr. Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave her for having that affair with President Taft."
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh. Taft, you old dog..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Really, Smithers, I'll be fine! I'm sure your replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he, anyway?"
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, Homer Simpson, Sir. One of your organ banks from sector 7-G. All the recent events of your life have revolved around him in some way."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Smithers? I don't understand 2700 of my new duties."
Waylon Smithers,"Well, the van's leaving. Which one duty is giving you the most trouble?"
Homer Simpson,"Um, what do I do in case of fire?"
Waylon Smithers,"Sorry, can't hear you. Bye-bye!"
Homer Simpson,Just my luck.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Good lord, Smithers! You look atrocious. I thought I told you to take a vacation."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Smithers already left, Sir. I'm his replacement, Homer Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, yes, Simpson. I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg."
Homer Simpson,But I think the dodo went extinct...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Get going! And answer those phones, install a computer system, and rotate my office so the window faces the hills."
Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?"
,
Homer Simpson,Lousy two-legged pants.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. ""Little Rascals"" isn't on 'til 6."
Homer Simpson,I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
Marge Simpson,"Ah, poor Homie. Poor, poor..."
,
Homer Simpson,Hmmm. One of these must be a breakfast maker.
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!"
Homer Simpson,Uh... they all won.
C. Montgomery Burns,Eh? What about my options?
Homer Simpson,"Well, you can either get up or go back to sleep."
C. Montgomery Burns,I believe I'll get up.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Scrub harder. Got to get that layer of dead skin off.
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I think the fangs today.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson? Simpson?
C. Montgomery Burns,Did you get that report on the accounting department?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Sir, I did."
Homer Simpson,The accounting department is located on the third floor. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The head of this department is a Mr. Johnson or Johnstone.
Homer Simpson,"Here are your messages: ""You have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""You have 10 minutes,"" ""Your car has been impounded,"" ""Your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""You have 30 minutes to move your cube."""
Homer Simpson,Hello. Mr. Burns' office.
C. Montgomery Burns,Is it about my cube?
Homer Simpson,It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.
,
Waylon Smithers,"How is everything going there, sir?... Well, I have a lot of free time on my hands. If you Fed Ex'd me your mail, I'd be happy to open it and return it to you."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Everything's fine, Smithers. But this Simpson fellow seems to be getting dumber by the minute. I've never seen anything quite like it... Anyhoo, you just enjoy your vacation."
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Look alive, Simpson! I'm not paying you to goldbrick!"
Homer Simpson,"Yes! Yes, sir!"
Bart Simpson,"Now get cracking on my long division. And don't forget to show your work, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"I'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, leave Simpson alone."
Lisa Simpson,Simpson! I need a ride to the library.
Marge Simpson,"Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down and relax."
Homer Simpson,"No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division."
Marge Simpson,Simpson! Lie down!
Marge Simpson,"Sorry, but you need a good night's rest."
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson!
,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,The telephone has been ringing for some time. Answer it.
Homer Simpson,Yello?... It's for you.
,
Waylon Smithers,"Mr. Burns, 48 rings! Are you all right? What did Simpson do to you?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Nothing other than drive me to distraction with his incompetent boobery. Terrible at everything. A complete moron. But I'm not really free to talk right now.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Look, stop calling me and start enjoying your vacation. Remember, I want to see lots of pictures when you get back."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Ah... actually, Sir, picture taking is not allowed at this particular resort. Whoops, I've got to go now -- there's a line forming behind me."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,60 watts! What do you think this is -- a tanning salon?
C. Montgomery Burns,I asked for light starch on my nightcap!
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,You call this Postum?!
C. Montgomery Burns,You call this a tax return?!
C. Montgomery Burns,You call this a super computer?!
C. Montgomery Burns,You're a travesty of a truke of an assistant.
Homer Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Is there something wrong, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,Except...
Homer Simpson,Except... I killed Mr. Burns.
Lisa Simpson,"What happened, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.
Lisa Simpson,Are you sure he's dead? Maybe you just really really hurt him.
Marge Simpson,"Okay. Maybe everything's all right. Maybe if you go apologize, he won't even fire you. If he's alive."
,
Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns?
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt on that eye."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, please! I can't bear another thrashing. Just leave me be."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Must call Smithers. He'll protect me from this beast.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've seen people activate this machine a thousand times. Doesn't seem to be any trick to it... Let's see... Smithers... ""S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S"". Success! It's ringing!"
,
Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm looking for a Mr. Smithers. First name, Waylon."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, so you're looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name, Waylon, is it? Listen to me, you... when I catch you, I'm going to pull out your eyes and shove 'em up your pants so you can watch me kick the crap out of you. Okay? Then I'm going to use your tongue to paint my boat."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, if only you could hear me."
,
Waylon Smithers,Something tells me Mr. Burns needs me.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Praise God, I think the thug has finally gone home for the day."
C. Montgomery Burns,Now I can make my escape...
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Mr. Burns. Do you want your coffee now?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Uh... no! I'm... uh... making it myself!
C. Montgomery Burns,Hear that? The percolations are imminent! No need to come in! Cease your ingress!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Stay back, Homer! Approach no further. Coffee's already made. I stomped the beans myself."
Homer Simpson,"Well, can I at least drive you home, Mr. Burns? It's five o'clock."
C. Montgomery Burns,"No... I thought... I thought, uh, I'd chauffeur myself this evening! Yes, that's what I thought. How difficult can it be? I'm sure the manual will indicate which lever is the velocitator and which the deceleratrix."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"I can't believe it! All my life I've avoided doing things for myself, but I'm actually enjoying this. Plus I'm making incredible time."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Beep beep! Out of my way, I'm a motorist!"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Ahh, that's some nice reckless driving, Mr. B!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Already taken care of.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Cappuccino, Simpson?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahoy-hoy? No, you have the wrong number. This is 5-2-4-6. I suspect you need more practice working your telephone machine. Not at all. Ahoy."
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, Homer. You've already done more for me than any man. Your brutal attack forced me to fend for myself. I realize now that being waited on hand and foot is okay for your average Joe, but it's not for me. I want to thank you."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Waylon Smithers,Oh my God! I knew I shouldn't have left!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, welcome back, Smithers. Say, do you know Homer Simpson? He pitched in around the office while you were away. Bang up job, Simpson, but I guess it's back to your trusty post in sector 7-G."
Waylon Smithers,"You heard the man, Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, and my dear, dear Smithers... you're no longer needed at all. You're fired. Ta!"
Homer Simpson,You shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
,
Marge Simpson,"Cheer up, Homie."
Homer Simpson,"I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how you'd feel, Marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do."
Bart Simpson,"Quick, Mom! Whip up a cake before Dad fires you!"
Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, Dad. Mr. Smithers is a resilient man. I'm sure he can get a great job at any corporation he wants."
,
Waylon Smithers,Meet your new piano mover.
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,We'll going to have to put a steel rod where your spine was.
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, will I ever move a piano again?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Oh, my goodness gracious, no."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Get ready for exciting quarter mile action at the Springfield Dragstrip. It'll be motorized mayhem !... Do we need all these ""mayhems?"" We do. All right, fair enough. I suppose you know your business. Get ready for fun ... The people are already here. We don't need to keep hustling them like this, do we? Hey, let go of me! Where are you throwing me?"
,
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, hello. You had a ""help wanted"" sign in the window?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, I need someone to help me with the midnight beer delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it's safely off the truck."
Waylon Smithers,I'll just wait out back until then.
Barney Gumble,I look forward to working with you!
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Smithers, wait!"
Homer Simpson,"You can't let yourself end up in a place like this. You've got two choices: You can give up on yourself and take the Barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. Or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
Waylon Smithers,You're right! But I'm going to need your help.
Moe Szyslak,"Oh,... my... God!..."
Truck Driver,"Beer delivery. Just sign here-- Oh, no, it's you!!"
Barney Gumble,
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I gotcha covered."
Waylon Smithers,"Mr. Burns may have mastered 2,799 of my 2,800 duties. But I'll wager dollars to donuts he still can't handle a call from his mother."
Homer Simpson,You're on.
Mrs. Burns,What.
Waylon Smithers,"Hello, Mrs. Burns? This is Waylon Smithers. I have your son Montgomery on the line."
Mrs. Burns,"That improvident lackwit. Always too busy striding about his atom mill to call his own mother. I'll give him ""what-fors"" till he cries brassafrax!"
Waylon Smithers,"Perfect. When I give the signal, you transfer the call to Mr. Burns. After she tears into him, I'll rush in and save the day."
Homer Simpson,Got it.
Homer Simpson,"I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,No problemo.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahoy-hoy? Hoy?
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Burns? This is your mother."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Gah! Oh, hello, Mater. Uh... Sorry about pulling the plug on you and all. Who could've known you'd pull through and... live for another five decades? Oh, is my face red..."
Waylon Smithers,"Mrs. Burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more desiccated. And she doesn't call her son Mr. Burns!"
Homer Simpson,"Son, this is Mrs. Burns! I just called to say I don't love you. You are a bad son, Montel!"
C. Montgomery Burns,So!
Homer Simpson,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Impersonate my mother, will you? And you, Smithers! You must have put him up to it! I'm glad I fired you."
Homer Simpson,"You really blew it this time, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,Stop that! Stop that at once! You're fighting!
Waylon Smithers,"Stop fighting like a girl, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,Okay.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Stop it! Stop it, I say!"
Waylon Smithers,"I'll teach you how to use a phone, you boob!"
Waylon Smithers,It's for you.
Homer Simpson,I'll show you.
Waylon Smithers,
Homer Simpson,
Waylon Smithers,Oh my.
,
Waylon Smithers,Here comes the endangered condor into the power lines.
Waylon Smithers,"I've got Bobo, hot from the dryer! Careful not to burn yourself on his eye."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't need you to do any of this. I'm totally self-sufficient now. What I would like, though, is a Spanish peanut."
C. Montgomery Burns,Skin.
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a remarkable thing. In the short time you were gone, I learned to be completely self reli--"
C. Montgomery Burns,"-- ant. Oh, and as for that brutish fellow who knocked me out the window... see that he gets what's coming to him."
Waylon Smithers,"I already have, sir."

Bart Simpson,What did you get that for?
Homer Simpson,For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.
Bart Simpson,Makes sense to me.
Lisa Simpson,Did he die?
Homer Simpson,What am I -- a doctor?

TV Announcer,"We now return to our 48-hour Itchy and Scratchy Diamond Jubilee Marathon, celebrating 75 years of rib-tickling brutality and hilarious atrocities."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, if I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me."
Lisa Simpson,Will do.
Kent Brockman,Tonight: a stow-away bear is terrorizing Space Shuttle astronauts! But first: a sneak peek at tomorrow's Itchy and Scratchy parade!
Kent Brockman,"Hello, everybody. I'm here live on Main Street, where dedicated fans are already staking out the best seats for the big Anniversary parade."
Lisa Simpson,"Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Bye, kids. On your way back, pick up a six pack of beer."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, Lisa! It's 11 o'clock at night. Where do you think you're going?"
Bart Simpson,Downtown.
Lisa Simpson,We've got to get seats for the Itchy and Scratchy parade.
Milhouse Van Houten,Shhh. That's Teddy Roosevelt.
Marge Simpson,"I won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. Homer, you go, too."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why can't they just take the gun?"
,
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, the comic book store's still open!"
Bart Simpson,Save our seats!
Homer Simpson,Will do.
Middle-aged Man,Hello.
Homer Simpson,
,
Scratchy,"Hey, sister, just gimme a chance to get next to you..."
Scratchy,"Hey, my threads, baby!"
Bart Simpson,How come I've never seen that Itchy and Scratchy before?
Comic Book Guy,"Perhaps because you are a pre-pubescent ignoramus. This is a bootleg copy of ""Itchy and Scratchy Meet Fritz The Cat."" Because of its frank depiction of sex and narcotic consumption, it is not for infantile intellects such as yours. Now, Toodle ooo."
Bart Simpson,Cool. I'll give you ten bucks for that.
Comic Book Guy,"Are you the creator of ""Hi & Lois?"" Because you are making me laugh. That drawing is worth exactly 750 dollars American."
Bart Simpson,"It's valuable, huh?"
Comic Book Guy,"Oooh, your powers of deduction are exceptional. I simply can't allow you to waste them here when there are so many crimes going unsolved at this very moment. Go, go! For the good of the city!"
Bart Simpson,Loser.
,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nertz."
Homer Simpson,Which one's Itchy? The car?
Bart Simpson,The mouse.
Homer Simpson,Oh. I guess that's not him then.
,
Brinkley,"Represented on this next float is Roger Myers Sr., who founded his company in 1921 and struck it big when he teamed up a mouse named Itchy with a cat named Scratchy."
Brinkley,Here we see him creating the two comical characters out of thoughts he plucks from his head.
Suzanne Somers,"And that man waving from the front of the float is his son, Roger Myers, Jr. Isn't this just the most fun you've ever had in your life, Dave?"
Brinkley,"Yes, Suzanne. It is."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, forget this. I'm outta here."
,
,
Suzanne Somers,"And now the parade has entered Bumtown! Oh, it's all just so exciting, Dave!"
Brinkley,This certainly seems to be a poorly planned parade route.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait up!"
Bum,"Get outta Bumtown, ya no-talent bum!"
Bart Simpson,"Show some respect, man! That ""no talent"" created Itchy and Scratchy."
Bum,He didn't create Itchy. I did.
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Bum,"He stole the character from me in 1928. When I complained, his thugs kicked me out of his office and dropped an anvil on me. Luckily, I was carrying an umbrella at the time."
Bart Simpson,"You invented Itchy? The ""Itchy and Scratchy"" Itchy?"
Bum,"Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept of cartoon violence. Before I came along, all cartoon animals did was play the ukulele. I changed all that."
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'm not calling you a liar, but... but I can't think of a way to finish that sentence."
Bum,"So I'm a liar, am I?"
Bart Simpson,Itchy The Lucky Mouse In: Manhattan Madness.
Bum,"That's the first Itchy cartoon ever made. And it was made by me, Chester J. Lampwick. Find me a ninety-year-old projector and I'll prove it to you."
,
Bart Simpson,Itchy Runs Afoul Of An Irishman.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Look out, Itchy! He's Irish!"
Milhouse Van Houten,
Milhouse Van Houten,C'mon Itchy! Kill him! Kill that guy!
Milhouse Van Houten,A chance for more mis...
Bart Simpson,Look at that fat oaf.
Milhouse Van Houten,
Milhouse Van Houten,
Bart Simpson,I can't believe it. That was Itchy all right. You did invent him! When people see this you'll be rich and famous!
Bart Simpson,
Chester Lampwick,"That was a nice film I had once. Last time I try to impress a four year old. Well, see ya, kid."
Bart Simpson,You can't just go back to the gutter! You created Itchy. You should be a millionaire!
Chester Lampwick,"Eh, Roger Myers wouldn't give me a cent in the Twenties, why would he give me anything now?"
Bart Simpson,"You asked Roger Myers, Sr. for money. Roger Myers, Jr. is in charge of the studio now. He's a good man. Every Christmas, he goes down to the pound and rescues one cat and one mouse and gives them to a hungry family."
Chester Lampwick,Studio's closed until Tuesday. Animators have AA on Monday.
Bart Simpson,"Hmm. Well, you can stay at my house until then. My parents won't mind, because they won't even know about it."
,
Bart Simpson,"All right, the coast is clear."
Bart Simpson,There's a box you can sleep in.
Chester Lampwick,Thanks.
Bart Simpson,Just move that cot out of the way.
Chester Lampwick,Okay.
Bart Simpson,Do you know what Radon is?
Chester Lampwick,No.
Bart Simpson,Goodnight.
Chester Lampwick,Spare change?
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. And Dad's upstairs."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's just Bart and a mysterious stranger."
Bart Simpson,"He's not a regular bum, Mom. He's a genius bum. He created Itchy. And he's the father of cartoon violence."
Bart Simpson,He just needs to stay here till tomorrow. We're going down to Itchy and Scratchy Studios to pick up his check.
Marge Simpson,"Well, if it's just for one more night."
,
Amendment,THEN I'LL CRUSH ALL OPPOSITION TO ME! / AND I'LL MAKE TED KENNEDY PAY / IF HE FIGHTS BACK / I'LL SAY / THAT HE'S GAY.
Chester Lampwick,800 billion dollars.
Chester Lampwick,Well that brought back a lot of memories.
,
Lionel Hutz,"All right, gentlemen. I'll take your case. But I'm going to have to ask for a $1,000 retainer."
Bart Simpson,"$1,000! But your ad says ""No Money Down!"""
,
Bart Simpson,"So, you don't work on a contingency basis?"
Lionel Hutz,"No, money down! Oops, shouldn't have this Bar Association logo here either."
,
Marge Simpson,Oh dear.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Dad, can I have $1,000?"
Homer Simpson,All right... Wait a minute. For what?
Bart Simpson,To pay for a lawyer for my bum.
Homer Simpson,Forget it.
Grampa Simpson,I thought I recognized you! I gave you a plate of corn muffins back in 1947 to paint my chicken coop. And you never did it.
Chester Lampwick,Those corn muffins were lousy!
Grampa Simpson,Paint my chicken coop!
Chester Lampwick,Make me!
Marge Simpson,That does it. One of them has to go.
Homer Simpson,Okay. Grampa.
Marge Simpson,No. The b-u-m.
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter.
Bart Simpson,"And all it will cost you is $1,000."

Blue-Haired Lawyer,"You will also notice Mr. Myers' name, and copyright notice, on the original drawings of the other members of the Itchy and Scratchy family: Brown-Nose Bear, Disgruntled Goat, Flatulent Fox, Rich Uncle Skeleton, and Dinner Dog."
Lionel Hutz,"My client's film predates all of those things, your honor."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,"Oh, yes. I've forgotten. Your famous film. The one you destroyed before the trial and haven't been able to find another copy of. Oh, yes. That film."
Lionel Hutz,Yes. You don't have a copy do you?
Blue-Haired Lawyer,Krusty have you ever seen this so-called animation genius before?
Krusty the Clown,Yes I have.
Courtroom Spectators,
Blue-Haired Lawyer,You have?
Krusty the Clown,"I gave him a couple of blintzes to paint my fence, but he never did it."
Chester Lampwick,Those blintzes were terrible!
Krusty the Clown,Paint my fence!
Chester Lampwick,Make me!
Krusty the Clown,You gimme back those blintzes then!
Judge Snyder,Order! Order! We don't care about your blintzes.
Lionel Hutz,"Now, Mr. Lampwick, when Roger Myers stole your character--"
Blue-Haired Lawyer,Objection.
Judge Snyder,Sustained.
Lionel Hutz,"Oof! If I hear ""objection"" and ""sustained"" one more time today I think I'm going to scream."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,Objection.
Judge Snyder,Sustained.
Lionel Hutz,
Chester Lampwick,Roger Myers didn't create any of his characters. He stole them all.
Courtroom Spectators,He stole them all!...
Chester Lampwick,"The only characters Myers could ever come up with were pathetic stick figures with the words ""Sarcastic Horse"" and ""Manic Mailman"" printed on them."
Chester Lampwick,And they stank. So he started stealing other people's characters.
Lionel Hutz,"Are you saying, under oath, Mr. Myers, that your father didn't steal any of the characters associated with your studio?"
Congressman,"Good news, amendment! They ratified ya! You're in the U.S. Constitution!"
,
Judge Snyder,"Mr. Hutz, we've been in here for four hours. Do you have any evidence at all?"
Lionel Hutz,"Well, Your Honor, we've got plenty of hearsay and conjecture. Those are kinds of evidence."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,"Your honor, I move for dismissal."
Bart Simpson,"I've got it! Dad, give me $750!"
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Bart Simpson,Keep the trial going. I'll be right back.
Lionel Hutz,"Your honor, I'd like to call all of my surprise witnesses again."
Courtroom Spectators,
,
Comic Book Guy,Thank you.
,
Bart Simpson,"I knew I had seen this exact scene somewhere else -- it was in the movie Mr. Lampwick showed me. Ladies and gentlemen, this drawing was made in 1919, nine years before Roger Myers made his first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,"That could have been drawn by anyone at any time, your honor. There's no signature or date."
Chester Lampwick,"Look under the frame, Brad!"
Bart Simpson,Careful... Careful...
Bart Simpson,It's there!
Judge Snyder,"Hmmm. ""To Roger Myers. Keep drawing -- your moxie more than makes up for your lack of talent. Your pal Chester J. Lampwick. Sept. 3, 1919."""
Courtroom Spectators,
Marge Simpson,Umm... How about... Ghostmutt?
Amendment,"Oh yeah! Door's open, boys!"
Mob Of Amendments,
Crazy Amendment,
Judge Snyder,The court rules in favor of Mr. Lampwick. Itchy and Scratchy Studios will pay a restitution of 800 billion dollars. Though that amount will probably come down a bit on appeal.
,
Bart Simpson,We killed Itchy and Scratchy?
Chester Lampwick,Good riddance! Wanna go celebrate? I feel like liver and onions.
,
Marge Simpson,"What are you going to do with all your money, Mr. Lampwick?"
Chester Lampwick,"Well, first off, here's your $1,000 back for hiring that lawyer. And $750 for the drawing. And here's a couple of bucks for your trouble."
Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Look, Marge! A couple of bucks!"
Chester Lampwick,As for the rest of it... I'm going to buy the one thing I've been dreaming of all the years I spent in the gutter... a solid gold house.

Little Boy,"Hey, who left all this garbage on the steps of Congress?"
Amendment,"I'm not garbage... I'M AN AMENDMENT TO BE / YES, AN AMENDMENT TO BE / AND I'M HOPING THAT THEY'LL RATIFY ME / THERE'S A LOT OF FLAG-BURNERS WHO HAVE GOT TOO MUCH FREEDOM / I WANT TO MAKE IT LEGAL FOR POLICEMEN TO BEAT 'EM / 'CAUSE THERE'S LIMITS TO OUR LIBERTIES / LEAST I HOPE AND PRAY THAT THERE ARE / 'CAUSE THOSE LIBERAL FREAKS GO TOO FAR."
Little Boy,But why can't we just make a law against flag-burning?
Amendment,Because that law would be unconstitutional. But if we change the Constitution...
Little Boy,...then we can make all sorts of crazy laws!
Amendment,Now you're catchin' on!
Bart Simpson,What the hell is this?
Lisa Simpson,It's one of those campy 70's throwbacks that appeals to Generation X'ers.
Bart Simpson,We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little...
Little Boy,What if people say you're not good enough to be in the Constitution?
Chief Wiggum,
Lisa Simpson,So it's true. Some cartoons do encourage violence.
Bart Simpson,Ow! We gotta get Itchy and Scratchy back.
Lisa Simpson,And soon.
Bart Simpson,Ow!
Lisa Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,You've got to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons.
Lisa Simpson,The judge says it's okay as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.
Bart Simpson,"Look, if money's the only problem, I know a guy who has lots of it."
,
Chester Lampwick,"Shoe shine, sir? Comb your hair for you? Sir?!"
Kent Brockman,
Chester Lampwick,Sir?! Sir?! Sir?!
Chester Lampwick,"Okay, catch you on the way back. Oh, hi kids."
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Chester. Listen, would you pay to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons?"
Lisa Simpson,You'll get more royalties.
Chester Lampwick,"I don't need any more money. I'm not greedy. As long as I've got my health and my millions of dollars and my gold house and my rocket car, I don't need anything else."
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, but..."
Chester Lampwick,Not interested.
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, can we have $183,000?"
Homer Simpson,What for?
Bart Simpson,Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
Homer Simpson,Oh... Forget it.
Lisa Simpson,I give up. There's nothing we can do.
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I agree. You wanna start on trying to get Apu out of jail?"
Lisa Simpson,Okay.
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, well, technically everything worked out all right. But..."
Marge Simpson,But?
Bart Simpson,Well... I wasn't the one who solved the problem and neither was Lisa. There's something unsettling about that.
,
Marge Simpson,"Wait, kids. You can't give up on Itchy and Scratchy. You're always so good at these things. Why, together you've reunited Krusty with his father, gotten Principal Skinner his job back, and helped Dr. Riviera perform open-heart surgery on your father. You've even foiled Sideshow Bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius."
Lisa Simpson,"You're right, Mom. I'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too."
Lisa Simpson,Bart! Look at this!
,
Bart Simpson,What a perfect plan. Now Roger Myers' hotel is just around the--
Bart Simpson,What the hell is going on?
Lisa Simpson,I don't know. But it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden.
Lester,"Thanks, everybody. But I couldn't have done all this without the help of my brainy sister Eliza."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I, too, owe many thanks to Lester and Eliza. This is a great vindication for anybody who was ever taking a bath, went to get the paper, fell down, and had the door slam behind them and the doorknob break off."
Krusty the Clown,And I'd like to thank Lester for reuniting me with my estranged wife.
Bart Simpson,I never even heard about that.
Lisa Simpson,I don't understand it. We're always the ones who solve these problems.
Bart Simpson,"I guess you don't need it now, but we had a plan too."

Lisa Simpson,"Dad, what's a ""muppet?"""
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I don't know."
Bart Simpson,Why did they make that one muppet out of leather?
Marge Simpson,"That's not a leather muppet, that's Troy McClure. Oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
Marge Simpson,What are you talking about?
Homer Simpson,"You know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? Those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? Why I heard..."
Marge Simpson,"Homer! That's just an urban legend. People don't do that type of thing with fish. Troy McClure is a perfect gentlemen, like Bing Crosby or JFK. I wonder where Troy is now?"

Homer Simpson,Mmmm... pointy.
Marge Simpson,It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.

Marge Simpson,Selma! Troy doesn't love you at all! He's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life and further his career!

Seymour Skinner,"G.M. Chrysler!! I can't afford that! But I can't close the school a day early just to suit my vacation. Or can I? Think, Seymour, think..."
,
Bart Simpson,Go to Work with Your Parents Day?
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, Go to Work with Your Parents Day! Tomorrow, you will learn by doing and apply your knowledge of fractions and gym to real-world situations!"
,
Lisa Simpson,I still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch Mom work.
Bart Simpson,"Because I've always been an advocate of women in the workplace, Lis."
Bart Simpson,I can't help it if Mom's workplace contains our TV.
Homer Simpson,'Cause they won't hire an assistant.
,
Marge Simpson,"I'm honored, Bart. And Lisa, you'll have a fine time at the plant with Dad. You've been interested in nuclear power for years."
Lisa Simpson,I've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
Marge Simpson,"Well, there you go."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, you're blocking the TV. If you need something to do, you can fill out my form. Here."
Marge Simpson,"""Parent's occupation... Please note: Homemaker is not allowed, as it is not real work. That's why you don't get paid for it."""
Lisa Simpson,Bart can take my place at the plant!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, but he so wanted to see women in the workplace..."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, how about Aunt Patty and Aunt Selma at the D.M.V.?"
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Of course! Of course! I would never, ever have thought of that!"
,
Patty Bouvier,Some days we don't let the line move at all.
Selma Bouvier,"We call those ""weekdays."""
Selma Bouvier,Good one.
Bart Simpson,"Well, at least I'm not stuck at the cracker factory like Milhouse."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Wow!
Kirk Van Houten,Ever wonder how crackers get salted?
Milhouse Van Houten,Have I?!
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Wow!
Crackerman,Crackers Ho!
Milhouse Van Houten,I never knew cracker production could be so exciting! But where do they make those crackers with the peanut butter already inside?
Kirk Van Houten,"Ah, put this on and come with me, Son."
,
Homer Simpson,Donut?
Lisa Simpson,"No, thanks. Do you have any fruit?"
Homer Simpson,This has purple stuff inside. Purple is a fruit.
Homer Simpson,"Uh... Oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. As a safety inspector, I am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs."
Lisa Simpson,Why are there so many burnt-out ones?
Kids,
"Martin Prince, Sr.","Martin, here's ten dollars to invest in"
"Martin Prince, Sr.",the futures market.
Martin Prince,Soy! Soy! Soy!
Other Traders,Soy! Soy! Soy!
"Martin Prince, Sr.","Martin, you're up one million dollars."
Martin Prince,Yes!
"Martin Prince, Sr.","And now you've lost all but $600. You got greedy, Martin."
,
Homer Simpson,I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
Lisa Simpson,Maybe we can make your job more fun... What are those?
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, what if we used our imaginations...?"
Lisa Simpson,"Houston, we have a problem. Homer 13 is spinning out of control!"
Lisa Simpson,I'm going after him!
Homer Simpson,"Boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!"
,
Selma Bouvier,"Okay, one more step. I just gotta go laminate your license. You'll get it in two to three weeks."
Cletus Spuckler,Hot damn! No more sittin' in the dirt at the drive-in!
Selma Bouvier,"Bart, I left the driver's-license-making machine on. Turn it off."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,25 years old?! You're not 25 years old! This I.D. is completely fake!
Bart Simpson,"Yes. You are right, Milhouse. It is a fake. Which makes it a fake I.D."
Milhouse Van Houten,A fake I.D.?! Cool!!
Bart Simpson,And it's our ticket to the best Spring Break of our lives!
,
Bart Simpson,"One adult and two children, please."
Nelson Muntz,I can think of at least two things wrong with that title.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Twenty-five? Whoa! Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. S., but you know, I gotta check everybody."
Bart Simpson,"Are you kidding? I take it as a compliment! Three beers, please!"
Barney Gumble,"Hey, join the party!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Spring breeeaaak! Yeah! Well, when are we gonna get rowdy?"
Bart Simpson,Maybe when we find something decent to do with this I.D.
Nelson Muntz,We could go rent a carpet shampooer...
Martin Prince,"Greetings, chums! Were your days at work as profitable as mine? I just had a sinful shopping spree at Wee World."
Bart Simpson,"Well, we're having the best Spring Break of our lives, and we don't need you around nerding it up."
Milhouse Van Houten,That job is taken.
Martin Prince,But surely I and my $600 could play some small part in your vacation fun.
Bart Simpson,"Oh yeah, right. Like there's any way to get some kicks with a big wad of cash and a license to drive..."
Milhouse Van Houten,Wow!
,
Martin Prince,"Oh, boy, Flipsy! You and I are going on a road trip!"
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
,
Bart Simpson,"Gentlemen, for our road trip, I have taken the liberty of preparing an airtight and utterly plausible alibi for use on our parents..."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,I've been selected to represent the school at the National Grammar Rodeo at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada.
,
Martin Prince,I've been selected to represent the school at the National Grammar Rodeo at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada.
,
Nelson Muntz,I'm goin' away for a week. See ya.
,
Marge Simpson,"The National Grammar Rodeo! I wish I were going. Oh, wait, wait -- I mean, I wish I was going. Is that right, Bart?"
Lisa Simpson,It's not fair! I'm the best student in school. How come I never heard about this competition?
Bart Simpson,"Maybe because you are, as we say in Latin, a Dorkus Malorkus."
Lisa Simpson,"That's not Latin. Mom, Bart's faking it."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, honey, you've had your glory. Now it's Bart's turn."
,
Nelson Muntz,I hate this place!
Milhouse Van Houten,"No... Oh, oh, cool... No, no, wait..."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Ow! Bart, Nelson hit me!"
Bart Simpson,He sure did.
Milhouse Van Houten,"A cup holder?!! Bart, we've gotta stop and get a cup! Uh... Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Cruise control, my good man. Everybody all set back here? Nelson, good to see you! Martin, always a pleasure..."

Milhouse Van Houten,

Homer Simpson,"Oh, Diablo Canyon 2... Why can't you be more like Diablo Canyon 1?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Hello?... Oh, Homie, hello! I can't remember the last time you called me from -- Oh, you want to speak to Lisa?"
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Lisa. How's your Spring Break going?"
Lisa Simpson,I'm learning about owls.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, owls, eh? So you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me..."
Lisa Simpson,Sure I would! I can always learn about owls this summer at Bird Camp.
,
Martin Prince,"Ah, we've arrived in the vast cornfields of Canada! How much farther to the Grammar Rodeo?"
Nelson Muntz,Grammar Rodeo?! We're goin' to a Grammar Rodeo?!
Bart Simpson,"We're not going to a Grammar Rodeo! That was just an alibi, Milton!!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Martin.
Bart Simpson,Martin.
Martin Prince,Fellows?
Nelson Muntz,What?
Martin Prince,Where are we going?
Martin Prince,"Well, I realize it's trite, but we could tour the bridges of Madison County..."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, who has better vacation ideas than Triple-A? According to the publisher of this Triple-A guidebook, no one."
Nelson Muntz,"I've always wanted to see Macon, Georgia."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Wait! How about a fair? Not just a county fair. Not just a Europe fair. But a WORLD'S Fair! The World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee!"
Bart Simpson,Keep reading...
Nelson Muntz,"Bart, can we weigh the car at that Weigh Station?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"The Hungarians have built a giant, motorized Rubik's Cube! And the fair's symbol is the Sunsphere, which sits atop a 266 foot tall steel shaft!"
Bart Simpson,What's inside?
Milhouse Van Houten,An information desk!
Martin Prince,Coooool!
Bart Simpson,So it's a choice between Disneyworld and Knoxville.
Martin Prince,Knoxville! Knoxville! Knoxville!
Bart Simpson,I concur.
,
Homer Simpson,You made it! Did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?
Lisa Simpson,Security guards?
Homer Simpson,Great! Ya wanna get some lunch?
Lisa Simpson,Sure!
Homer Simpson,"The way I figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs."
Lisa Simpson,Why do you need me?
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here I trust. Ready?"
Lisa Simpson,Ready!
Lisa Simpson,Woo hoo!
Waylon Smithers,Simpson! What in God's name are you--
Lisa Simpson,"Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers? Razzles? Skittles? Whatchamacallit? Twizzlers?"
Homer Simpson,They all have hilarious names and are delicious.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, I am partial to Jolly Ranchers... Mmmmmm. Good work, Simpson. Simpsons."
,
Homer Simpson,"Boy, Lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you."
Lisa Simpson,We could have a slumber party.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."
,
Angry Dad,"If you kids can't keep your hands to yourselves, I'm going to turn this car around, and there'll be no Cape Canaveral for anybody!"
Angry Dad,That's it! Back to Winnipeg!
Martin Prince,"Bart, can we stop for ice cream?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, can we pick up that hitchhiker?"
Bart Simpson,I don't see why not.
Deranged-looking Hitchhiker,"Bart, can we stop for ice cream?"
Bart Simpson,Yes.
Deranged-looking Hitchhiker,"...well, I didn't think I was rehabilitated, but I guess they needed the extra bed..."
,
Marge Simpson,"With Bart gone, and now you and your father, I'm not going to have anyone to--"
Lisa Simpson,ThanksMombye!
Marge Simpson,

Nelson Muntz,What is this place?
Bart Simpson,"Branson, Missouri. My dad says it's like Vegas if it were run by Ned Flanders."
Nelson Muntz,Andy Williams?!
Bart Simpson,"Uh, we don't need to stop here."
Nelson Muntz,Yes we do.
,
Andy Williams,...MY HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND / MOON RIVER AND ME!
Nelson Muntz,"Wow! I didn't think he was going to do ""Moon River"" but then -- Bam! -- second encore!"
,
Lisa Simpson,Okay. Time for truth or dare. You go first.
Homer Simpson,Eh... Truth. Ask me anything.
Lisa Simpson,"Who do you love most: me, Bart, or Maggie?"
Homer Simpson,"All right, dare."
Lisa Simpson,Okay... Why don't you...
Homer Simpson,"Hello, I'd like to speak with a Mr. Snotball? First name, Ura?"
,
Moe Szyslak,Ura Snotball?
,
Homer Simpson,"What?! How dare you! If I find out who this is, I'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to Iran!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay, your turn."
Lisa Simpson,Hmmm... Truth.
Homer Simpson,Ummm... Do you have a crush on anyone?
Lisa Simpson,Da-ad!
Homer Simpson,I won't tell anybody.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you tell everybody everything. Even Moe knew when I threw up on the dentist."
Homer Simpson,"Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows! Well, just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secrets."
Lisa Simpson,Okay. I like...
Lisa Simpson,Langdon Alger.
Homer Simpson,I have no idea who that is.
Lisa Simpson,Nobody does! He's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. But that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
Homer Simpson,"I've already forgotten his name. It was Larsen something, right?"
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks, Dad. Oh, this has been the best Spring Break ever!"

Bart Simpson,We're on the home stretch!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Next stop, the Knoxville World's Fair and its fabulous Sunsphere!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Hurry up! We've only got four days to spend at the... ""Wod Fir?"""
Bart Simpson,"Uh, excuse me... Is this the World's Fair Visitors Center?"
Proprietor,Used to be. Back in 1982. You're fourteen years too late.
Milhouse Van Houten,"But there's another World's Fair coming soon, right? Before Friday?"
Bart Simpson,What about the Sunsphere?
Proprietor,"You mean the Wigsphere. You're welcome to go up there, if you wanna see 16,000 boxes of unsold wigs. Now, you gentlemen gonna buy some wigs or ain't ya?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"I guess fate was against us. It's really nobody's fault. Right? Uh, right?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, we've still got a car and a wad of cash."
Martin Prince,"Er, no we don't. I must've spent our last ten dollars on this Al Gore doll."
Al Gore Doll,You are hearing me talk.
Bart Simpson,We've got no car!
Martin Prince,We've got no money!
Milhouse Van Houten,And no one knows we're here!
Martin Prince,We're stranded!
Milhouse Van Houten,
Nelson Muntz,"But on the plus side, I knocked over the Sunsphere."
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Nelson Muntz,"This never would've happened if we'd gone to Macon, Georgia. I'm just sayin', is all."
Martin Prince,"Fellows, I think perhaps the time has come to call our parents."
Bart Simpson,"No!! They'd kill us! Look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. All we need is money, food, and a way to get home. Follow me."
Bart Simpson,Everybody remember: we're parked under the Sunsphere.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey! I need those to see!
Pawn Shop Clerk,"Ah, these lenses are perfect. Now I can re-bottom those antique Coke bottles."
Pawn Shop Clerk,Three hundred...
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey!...
Pawn Shop Clerk,Four hundred...
Milhouse Van Houten,Come back!...
Pawn Shop Clerk,Five hundred... Six hundred.
Milhouse Van Houten,Wh... wh... Oh!... Oh... Ow!... Oh...
Pawn Shop Clerk,Five hundred. Four hundred. Three hundred. Two hundred. One hundred. Zero...
Bart Simpson,Come on! This train goes right through Springfield!
Milhouse Van Houten,
,
Marge Simpson,Of course I'll accept! Bart! I've missed you so mu-- You want to speak to Lisa?
Lisa Simpson,"So how's the National Grammar Rodeo, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, I really need your help, so I'm gonna let you in on a secret. There's no such thing."
Lisa Simpson,"I knew it! I knew it because why would they have our National Grammar Rodeo in another nation?! Oh, Bart, you're going to be in sooo much trouble when--"
Bart Simpson,I'm in trouble already. Here's what happened...So you've got to think of a way I can come home for free.
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, d'you ever think about the people in those cars?"
Lisa Simpson,"Hmm... You could travel for free if you were a stewardess. Well, how badly do you want to get home? All right, all right, how about a courier? They travel for free, too. No, that's a terrier. They're dogs."
,
,
Owner,"Well, you sure don't look 25, but your unlaminated, out-of-state driver's license is proof enough for me. Here's your first assignment."
,
Bart Simpson,ZhÃ¨ shÃ¬ nide yÃ¡njing.
Chinese Doctor,XiÃ¨ xiÃ¨.
Seymour Skinner,What the...?
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Can we call our parents yet, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Lisa? This isn't working. I've got to courier something to Springfield. And it's gotta be big enough to fit Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson inside."
Lisa Simpson,"But Bart, that'll cost a fortune."
Owner,"Simpson, how'd you like to escort 500 Big Macs to Marlon Brando's island?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I can't take much more of this. I'm counting on you, Lis."
,
Lisa Simpson,Whee.
Homer Simpson,"What's wrong, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,"There's something troubling me, Dad...but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, you don't have to tell me, but I thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. I mean, I haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend."
Lisa Simpson,"Langdon Alger? Oh, I don't like him anymore... Okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart."
Homer Simpson,I promise.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and Bart's working as a courier and just came back from Hong Kong."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, that's a real pickle. Would you excuse me for a moment?"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, and then I will murder him."
Lisa Simpson,"No, no! Then he'll know I told! Dad, you said I could trust you."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, we'll work this out together. First things first: where is Knoxville?"
Lisa Simpson,"It's in Tennessee, right next to the Oak Ridge Nuclear Facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb."
Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge..."
Lisa Simpson,...and Bart could be the courier!
Homer Simpson,"Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console."
Oak Ridge Engineer,"Uh, Springfield, my computer shows your T-437 is fully operational."
,
Homer Simpson,"And have it sent to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, care of Homer J.--"
Lisa Simpson,"No! Don't use your real name, or Bart will know!"
Homer Simpson,Forget the name Homer Simpson. Have it sent care of... Langdon Alger.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, Bart... Bart, we really could use another air hole."
Bart Simpson,Ssshh! They'll know you're in there!
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Hello? Oh, hello, Principal Skinner... No, Bart has never been to Hong Kong... Goodnight."
Marge Simpson,"Hello? Tennessee State Police? No, my son's car was not crushed in Knoxville. I don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that."
Marge Simpson,"Hello? No, Bart is not available tomorrow to deliver a human kidney to Amsterdam!"
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, are you laughing at me?"
,
,
Milhouse Van Houten,I try not to. It makes it harder to spit on 'em.
Bart Simpson,"Sometimes I wonder about all the people in this town. Do you think anything interesting ever happens to them? I mean, there must be thousands of great stories out there."
Bart Simpson,"What do you think, Milhouse? Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hunh? Oh, sorry, I saw a convertible. You were saying?"
Bart Simpson,"Forget it. C'mon, it's 11 o'clock. I need some sugar."

Marge Simpson,Are you sure? Maybe it's just shampoo. That washes right out.
Lisa Simpson,"No, it's somebody's gross gum! Get it out! Ow! Ow! It's pulling out my hairs!"
Marge Simpson,"Wait -- if I remember my Heloise, the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter."

Seymour Skinner,"Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouth-watering hamburgers!"
Gary Chalmers,I thought we were having steamed clams.
Seymour Skinner,"No, no. I said ""steamed hams."" That's what I call hamburgers."

Seymour Skinner,Yes. It's a regional dialect.
Gary Chalmers,Uh-huh. What region?
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, Upstate New York."

Chief Wiggum,Example?
Lou,"Well, in McDonald's you can buy a Krustyburger with Cheese, right?, but they don't call it a Krustyburger with Cheese."
Chief Wiggum,Get out--! What do they call it?
Lou,Quarter Pounder with Cheese.
Chief Wiggum,"""Quarter Pounder with Cheese."" Well, I can picture the cheese... But, uh, do they have Krusty Partially-Gelatinated Non-Dairy Gum-Based Beverages?"
Lou,"Mmm-hmm. They call 'em ""shakes."""
Eddie,"Heh. ""Shakes."" You don't know what you're gettin'."
Chief Wiggum,"Well, I know what I'm gettin': some donuts. Uh, help me outta the booth, boys."

Ned Flanders,Marge Simpson -- still making juice the old-fashioned way?
Lisa Simpson,"No, I've got gum in my hair!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, we've tried everything. Olive oil, lemon juice, tartar sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba ghanouj..."
Lisa Simpson,My scalp hurts from horsefly bites.
Ned Flanders,Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? Works for me when I get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom.
Lisa Simpson,That sounds okay...
Lisa Simpson,Ah! Ah! Ah! Stop! Stop!
Ned Flanders,Hmm. I seem to have mashed more hair into it. Oh well.
Groundskeeper Willie,"Ice cubes are useless, man. Chewin' gum's gotta be chewed out."

Comic Book Guy,That is a rare photo of Sean Connery signed by Roger Moore. It is worth one hundred and fifty dollars.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, what can I get for seventy-five cents?"
Comic Book Guy,"You may purchase this charming Hamburglar Adventure. A child has already solved the jumble using crayons. The answer is ""fries."""

Professor Jonathan Frink,"Oh, sorry I'm late. There was trouble at the lab, with the running and the exploding and the crying. One of the monkeys stole the glasses off my head."

Grampa Simpson,"Aw, jabberjack! Schoolhouse don't put out spittoons, I ain't responsible."
Edna Krabappel,"All right, seniors, we'd all love to share in your wisdom, experience, yadda yadda yadda. Let's start with Milhouse's grandfather."
Grampa Van Houten,How many of you have a house?
Grampa Van Houten,"All right. Now, how many of you drove your house to school today?"
Kids,
Grampa Van Houten,"Well, I did. No, I'm not Superman, I just own an R.V."
Grampa Van Houten,"Me and the new wife travel the country searching for adventure. Last fall we won a chili cook-off in Beaumont, Texas."
Kids,
Grampa Simpson,"You're living in a fool's paradise, Van Houten. If you fell down in the shower, that thing'd be your tomb!"
Bart Simpson,"Grampa, hush."
Bart Simpson,"Here, why don't you spit some more."
Judge Grandfather,"No, I'm not Superman, I'm a judge. Why just this morning, I sentenced my 46th man to death. No, 47th!"
Nelson Muntz,"Wow, 47. I love you, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, well, I may not have a fancy black bathrobe and a hammer like Snooty, but I do have slippers and an oatmeal spoon. Look!"
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, perhaps your grandfather would like to come up front now and give someone else a chance to interrupt."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, please, no."
Grampa Simpson,"Now... hey, listen! Now, my story begins in 19-dickety-two. We had to say ""dickety"" 'cause the Kaiser had stolen our word ""twenty."" I chased that rascal to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six miles."
Martin Prince,Dickity? Highly dubious.
Grampa Simpson,"What're you cackling at, Fatty? Too much pie, that's your problem!"
Grampa Simpson,"Now, I'd like to digress from my prepared remarks to discuss how I invented the terlet."
Edna Krabappel,Terlet. Ha!
Kids,
Grampa Simpson,Stop yer snickering! I spent three years on that terlet!
,
Bart Simpson,...And then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. Why is he always making up those crazy stories?
Homer Simpson,Maybe it's time we put Grampa in a home.
Lisa Simpson,You already put him in a home.
Bart Simpson,Maybe it's time to put him in one where he can't get out.
Lisa Simpson,No! Old people deserve our respect! Look at Jacques Cousteau and Goldie Hawn. You wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
Homer Simpson,"Second class? What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet."
,
Grampa Simpson,"Ehh, this junk was hardly worth getting up for. Maybe if I go back to sleep for a few days, some good mail will build up."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, what's this?"
Grampa Simpson,Asa Phelps has-- The seventh Hellfish is dead! That means the fortune's almost mine!
,
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Asa Phelps spent his entire life in Springfield. Except for four years' service in World War II and one high school day-trip. He worked at the United Strut and Bracing Works as a molder's boy, until he was replaced by a Molder-Matic and died."

C. Montgomery Burns,Would you do the honors...?
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Simpson, seven gone. As soon as you're in your pressboard coffin, I'll be the sole survivor, and the treasure will be mine!"
Grampa Simpson,Over my dead body it will!
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's exactly the poi-- Oh, Simpson, can't you go five seconds without humiliating yourself?"
Grampa Simpson,How long was that?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Your clownish behavior notwithstanding, we have made a gentleman's agreement and sworn on our lives to honor it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I want that man killed."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see... ""Mesmerists,"" ""Dowsers,"" ""Luddites,"" ""Alienists,"" ""Zoroastrians,"" ""Alphabetizers,""... Aha! ""Assassins!"""
Waylon Smithers,"I was wondering, Sir, do we really need to, uh... ""settle"" Abe Simpson? I mean, I'm familiar with his physical state, and perhaps if we wait, nature will assassinate him for us."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I can't risk it. I won't allow that Simpson boy to take the Hellfish Bonanza, and I can't get it without his key!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, just the man I need. Fernando Vidal, the world's most devious assassin."
,
,
VIDAL,Hola.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Fernando, it's ""M.B."""
VIDAL,"Ah, Marion Barry... Is it time for another shipment already?"
C. Montgomery Burns,This is Montgomery Burns.
VIDAL,"Oh, caramba."
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm sending you a photo over the Faxtrola. I need you to fly to Springfield and assassinate this man post-haste.
VIDAL,"Ah, Del Monte. Enjoy them, old man, they will be your last."
,

Grampa Simpson,I'm up! I'm up!
VIDAL,"Ah, he's more clever than he looks."
Voice On Intercom,"Abraham Simpson, your family is here to visit you."

Phony Homer,Not again.
Phony Marge,I can't take much more of your blundering numskullery.
Waylon Smithers,"I'll be in the car, dudes."

VIDAL,"There is one more way to kill a man, but it is as intricate and precise as a well-played game of chess..."
,
Jasper Beardly,Was that me or was that you?
Grampa Simpson,Nurse! Someone's trying to kill me!
Nurse,Okay. We'll do something about that right away. Let's start by doubling your medication.
Nurse,Our residents... are trying... to nap!
,
Grampa Simpson,"Lemme in! Someone's trying to kill me! Sweet Merciful McGillicuddy, ya gotta open the door!"
Homer Simpson,Who is it?
Marge Simpson,It's Grampa. And it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again.
Grampa Simpson,...and then a knife flew at my head! And you were there... And you were there...
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, Grampa, maybe I should moisten your washcloth..."
Grampa Simpson,"It's plenty moist! Listen, Monty Burns is tryin' to kill me and it's all because of um... I can't tell you why."
Bart Simpson,"Well, I'm sure you'll make up something. Maybe you just need more of my classmates around."
Grampa Simpson,I gotta hole up here for awhile. They might still be after me.
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, he's even more agitated than usual. Maybe we should let him stay."
Marge Simpson,But where are we going to put him?
Homer Simpson,Bart's room.
Lisa Simpson,Bart's room.
Marge Simpson,Bart's room.
Bart Simpson,Dumpster.
,
Grampa Simpson,"Sorry to crowd ya, boy, but I'll let you in on a secret. Burns is after me 'cause he wants the Hellfish Bonanza."
Bart Simpson,"Look, if you're going to stay in my room, could you at least stop making up gibberish?"
Grampa Simpson,"Gibberish, eh? Then what's this?"
Bart Simpson,Wrinkly gibberish?
,
Grampa Simpson,"Back then, I was known as Sgt. Simpson, and I commanded the Flying Hellfish -- the fightingest squad in the fightingest company in the third fightingest battalion in the army. And we were all from Springfield. There was Police Chief Wiggum's father, Iggy Wiggum..."
Iggy Wiggum,"Um, if anybody finds a grenade without a pin, that's mine."
Grampa Simpson,"...our radio-man, Sheldon Skinner..."
Sheldon Skinner,"All right. Very funny. Well, I didn't join the service to make friends."
Grampa Simpson,...and watchin' our backs was Private Fifth-Class Arnie Gumble.
Arnie Gumble,
Grampa Simpson,"Then there was also Griff, Asa, Ox and Etch."
Grampa Simpson,But every unit has a troublemaker. Ours was a cocky little private named Montgomery Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns,Haven't you won the war yet?
Ox,"Uh, hey, you said you was dead!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"""Dead -- tired,"" but I'm quite refreshed now, thank you."
Bart Simpson,"Mmm-hmm. You bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town. How come you were a sergeant and he was only a private?"
Grampa Simpson,"Well, he got busted down for obstructing a probe from J. Edgar Hoover. And we got stuck with him..."
Grampa Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh. Now they'll never save your brain, Hitler..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Little help?
C. Montgomery Burns,
Grampa Simpson,"Boom! Boom, it went! Boom! Just like that! They took a photo of my keister for Stars & Stripes. At least they told me it was for Stars & Stripes."
Bart Simpson,"Well, if you saved Burns' life, why does he want to kill you?"
Grampa Simpson,It was the closing days of the war. We had just flushed some Germans out of an abandoned castle...
,
,
Arnie Gumble,Hey! Burnsie found some pictures!
Iggy Wiggum,"Wait a minute, we ain't supposed to steal from civilians."
Grampa Simpson,"You want me to report ya to Commander Flanders? Just leave 'em, Burnsie."
C. Montgomery Burns,Leave them for whom? The Germans? The folks who shoot at us all day? Let's just take them. We'll all be rich! Rich as Nazis!
Etch,Think of what a guy could get himself with that kind of scratch.
Sheldon Skinner,"Eh, I could buy chicken dinners, three times a day!"
Iggy Wiggum,I could buy a brand new Studebaker with a fan on the dashboard!
Arnie Gumble,I could buy my way into high society!
Grampa Simpson,"Well, I don't feel right about it... but I could use a nest egg for retirement. I'd hate to wind up in one of them old folks homes."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Then it's agreed. Of course, we can't sell the paintings now. We'd be caught. How many of you are familiar with the concept of a ""tontine?"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Ox. Why don't you take us through it?"
Ox,"Uh, essentially, we all enter into a contract whereby the last surviving participant becomes the sole possessor of all them purty pitchers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well put, Oxford. Now remember, you can't all sign with an X..."
Grampa Simpson,"So we sealed up the paintings, knowing only one of us would ever look upon them again."
Grampa Simpson,"Ox was the first to go -- he got a hernia carrying the crate out of the castle. Five more men died in the Veterans' Day float disaster of '79. Now with Asa gone, it's down to me and Burns."
Bart Simpson,"Great story, Grampa. Coulda used a vampire, though. 'Night."
Grampa Simpson,My own grandson thinks I'm a liar.
Grampa Simpson,Aghhh! Don't kill me!
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've tried to meet you halfway on this, Simpson, but you had to be Little Johnny Live-a-lot. Now give me your key to the Hellfish Bonanza."
Bart Simpson,"Oh wow! There really is a treasure! Whatever you do, don't give him the key, Grampa!"
Grampa Simpson,Here's the key.
Bart Simpson,"Figures... Hey, Mr. Burns!"
Bart Simpson,Can I go with you to get the treasure? I won't eat much and I don't know the difference between right and wrong.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, you're a good boy. But the child labor people have been watching me like a hawk."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'm off to get the paintings. As they say, time is Monets. As you were, Sergeant."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, terribly sorry. Back to sleep,"
C. Montgomery Burns,little girl.
Grampa Simpson,I guess Burns is finally gonna be rich.
Bart Simpson,"Not without the keys, he isn't."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, you got the keys!"
Bart Simpson,Now we can get the treasure!
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, what's the use? Burns would still find some way to take it from me."
Bart Simpson,"I can't believe you, Grampa. The sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like Burns! You gotta get that treasure! You gotta do it for Ox and Asa and Griff and Burnsie... Well, not so much Burnsie."
Grampa Simpson,You really think I can do it?
Bart Simpson,"Uh, yes. But we gotta act fast!"
Homer Simpson,Where are you two going at this hour?
Bart Simpson,On a treasure hunt.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, can I come?"
Grampa Simpson,"Only if you're ready to stare danger in the face, put your manhood to the ultimate test, and take--"
Homer Simpson,Pass.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Grampa, do you think your dead buddies get up and walk around at night?"
Grampa Simpson,"If they're anything like me, they have to get up twice. Okay, hold up here."
Grampa Simpson,"Fellas, it's me, Sarge. At ease. I know I'm bendin' the rules tonight, but I also know none of you wants that skunk Burns to take our treasure. And I want you to know that when I die, you're all welcome to visit me in rich man's heaven."
Grampa Simpson,Now it's gonna show us exactly where to dig!
Bart Simpson,
,
Grampa Simpson,"Boy, you borrow us some diving equipment while I borrow this boat."
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdilly-doodily, stranger! Couldn't help but notice you stealing my boat."
Grampa Simpson,I'll bring it back.
Ned Flanders,You ever operated a power boat?
Grampa Simpson,No.
Ned Flanders,Know anything about water safety?
Grampa Simpson,No.
Ned Flanders,What do you need it for?
Grampa Simpson,It's a secret.
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling. Just promise you'll have a good time."
Ned Flanders,Maude? Boys? Come on up! We're gonna have a little camp-out in the dinghy.
ROD/TODD,Yayyy!
Grampa Simpson,"Now remember the plan, boy. If you run out of air, tug on the rope--"
Bart Simpson,"--sixty-four times. No more, no less. Got it."
Grampa Simpson,"No, no. Sixty-three times if you're out of air. Sixty-four is if you found the treasure."
Bart Simpson,"Gotcha. Hey, Grampa, do you think I could've been a Flying Hellfish?"
Grampa Simpson,You're a gutsy daredevil with a give-'em-hell attitude and a fourth-grade education. You coulda made sergeant.
Bart Simpson,Wo-o-o-ow!
Grampa Simpson,"61... 62... 63... Oh, no, 63?! He's out of air! I've sent my only grandson to a watery gra... !"
Grampa Simpson,64?! He found the treasure! I'm rich!
Grampa Simpson,"You're one heckuva grandson, boy! Now, let's break 'er open and have a look-see."
Bart Simpson,Huh. The light must've burned out.
C. Montgomery Burns,I'll thank you to stop pinching my Botticelli.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Looks like I didn't need the keys after all. I'll take the masterpieces, thank you."
Grampa Simpson,Consarn it!
Bart Simpson,"You coward! You're an embarrassment to the name ""Hellfish!"""
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, am I?"
Grampa Simpson,"No! Look, take the art if you want. Just don't hurt the boy."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmm. I'd rather do both.
C. Montgomery Burns,"So long, Sarge. See you at the reunion in November."
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry I cost you your fortune, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,"Ah, the fortune doesn't matter, boy. The important thing is you're safe. Now let's get that fortune!"
Waylon Smithers,"They're gaining on us, sir. We'll have to jettison something."
Waylon Smithers,"It's been an honor to serve you, sir."
Bart Simpson,"Consarn it, he's getting away!"
Grampa Simpson,In a pig's eye he is!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Act your age, Simpson! You look foolish!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Agh! Don't kill me!
Grampa Simpson,I ain't gonna kill ya. That'd be cowardly. Monty Burns cowardly. I just wanna watch you squirm.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, sir! Is this to your liking?"
Grampa Simpson,"Now, Burnsie, there's one thing we don't stand for in the Hellfish, and that's trying to kill your commanding officer. So consider this your dishonorable discharge. You're outta my unit. You're outta the tontine. And that means the paintings are mine. Private, you are dismissed."
Bart Simpson,"You're rich, Grampa! You did it! And Burns can never take that away from you!"
State Dept. Man #1,Freeze! U.S. State Department! We'll take those.
State Dept. Man #2,We've been helping the German government search for this stolen art for 50 years.
State Dept. Man #1,"To avoid an international incident, we'll be returning it to the descendant of its rightful owner."
State Dept. Man #2,"Baron Von WÃ¶rtzenburger, on behalf of the American people, I apologize for--"
Von WÃ¶rtzenburger,"Ja, ja, ja. Mach schnell mit der art things, huh?. I must get back to DanceCentrum in Stuttgart in time to see Kraftwerk."
VON WÃ–RTZENURGER,"Hey, and Dummkopf! Watch out for the CD changer in my trunk, huh?! Idiot!"
Grampa Simpson,"I guess he deserves it more than I do... Well, at least I got to show you I wasn't always a pathetic old kook."
Bart Simpson,"You never were, Grampa."
Grampa Simpson,"Aw, I'd hug ya, but I know you'd just get embarrassed."
Bart Simpson,I won't get embarrassed. I don't care who knows I love my Grampa.
Von WÃ¶rtzenburger,"Hey, funboys! Get a room!"

,
Homer Simpson,"Looks like bad news for the... ...""Impson"" family."
Homer Simpson,"Let's all calm down. Everyone's going to be just fine, as long as I've got enough beer."
Homer Simpson,"All right, that does it. If I'm gonna be trapped inside the house I gotta go out and buy some beer."
Homer Simpson,Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
Bart Simpson,"I've got ya, dad!"

Chief Wiggum,"Sweet dreams, Smokey."
Barney Gumble,Animal tranquilizer!
Barney Gumble,Smooth.
Bear,
Chief Wiggum,"Book 'em, Lou. One count of being a bear. And one count of being an accessory to being a bear."
Maude Flanders,"Oh Marge, it was horrible. We were trapped in the house all afternoon and, well, we had to drink toilet water."
Marge Simpson,"Well, things were bad everywhere."
Homer Simpson,I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
Ned Flanders,"Well, now realistically, Homer, I've lived here some 30-odd years. This is the first and only bear I've ever seen."
Homer Simpson,"Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?"
Mob,/ I am! / We are! / etc.

Mayor Joe Quimby,Does it have an appointment?
Aide,"Ahm, yes it does."
Seymour Skinner,I phoned ahead.
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears."
Moe Szyslak,And these ones are smarter than the average bear. They swiped my pic-a-nic basket!
Helen Lovejoy,Think of the children.
Mayor Joe Quimby,Very well. I promise swift and decisive action against these hibernating hucksters.
Homer Simpson,
Mayor Joe Quimby,

Homer Simpson,"Ahh, not a bear in sight. The bear patrol must be working like a charm."
Lisa Simpson,"That's specious reasoning, Dad."

Lisa Simpson,"By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, how does it work?"
Lisa Simpson,It doesn't work.
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Lisa Simpson,It's just a stupid rock.
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Lisa Simpson,"But I don't see any tigers around here, do you?"
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I want to buy your rock."
Homer Simpson,"Woo-hoo! A perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck!"
Homer Simpson,Hey... how come my pay is so low?
Homer Simpson,Bear Patrol Tax: $5?! What?! This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history!
Lisa Simpson,"Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
Homer Simpson,Let the bears pay the bear tax. I pay the Homer Tax.
Lisa Simpson,That's the Home-Owner Tax.
Homer Simpson,"Well, anyway, I'm still outraged."

Mob,DOWN WITH TAXES! DOWN WITH TAXES!

Helen Lovejoy,Won't you think of the children?
Mayor Joe Quimby,Are these morons getting dumber or just louder?
Aide,"Uh, dumber, sir. They won't give up the Bear Patrol, but they won't pay taxes for it, either."
Mayor Joe Quimby,Ducking this issue calls for real leadership.

Mayor Joe Quimby,"People, your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants! That's right, illegal immigrants. We need to get rid of them!"

Ãœter,I do not deserve this. I have come here legally as an exchange student!
Seymour Skinner,"Young man, the only thing we exchanged for you is our national dignity."
Kids,
Groundskeeper Willie,You want to pick on immigrants?! Then pick on Willie!
Seymour Skinner,"Willie, please. The children want to pick on someone their own size."
Groundskeeper Willie,Ach.
,
Lisa Simpson,"I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn."
Bart Simpson,"There's no denying it, Sis."
Lisa Simpson,"But immigration is what America's all about. Even the Simpson family immigrated to America. Right, Grampa?"
Grampa Simpson,"Okay, you twisted my arm. The Simpson story begins back in the old country... I forget which one exactly..."
,
Grampa Simpson,My father would drone on and on about America. He thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread -- sliced bread having been invented the previous winter.
GREAT GRAMPA,"See this, son? That's where we're going to live. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but some day."
Grampa Simpson,"Later that day, we set sail for America."
,
Great Grampa Simpson,There it is! Our new home.
,
GREAT GRAMMA SIMPSON,Abe! Supper's on!
Grampa Simpson,We had to move out once we'd filled the head with garbage. The end.
,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular Joes like you and me, Apu."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Ah... Mr. Simpson? It may astonish you to learn that I am an immigrant.
Homer Simpson,You? Pfft. I don't believe it.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No. In truth, an illegal immigrant, Sir. If Proposition 24 passes, I shall be forced to leave this country."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, I wish... Oh, I wish I could have stayed just one more year or two. There was so much I wanted to see and to do and to have done to me."
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. I got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of Proposition 24, I never stopped to think it might affect someone I cared about."
Homer Simpson,"You know what, Apu... I am really, really gonna miss you."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. They want all the benefits of livin' in Springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language."
Homer Simpson,Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.
Barney Gumble,
Moe Szyslak,"Eh, you said it, Barn."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Make the protesters go away and I'll give you the entire bottle.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, thank goodness. My first customers in a week."
Marge Simpson,It's hard to believe someone so close to our family could be an illegal alien.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Alas, it is true. I came here shortly after my graduation from Cal Tech -- Calcutta Technical Institute..."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"As the top student in my graduating class of 7 million, I was accepted for graduate study in the United States."
,
Apu's Father,"Wherever you go and whatever you do, we will always love you. Make us proud, son."
Apu's Mother,Never forget who you are.
Young Apu,"I won't, mother. And I won't forget you, Manjula. I'm so sorry our arranged marriage will not come to pass."
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,"Farewell, my beloved."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I enrolled at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology under the tutelage of the brilliant Professor John Frink.
,
Young Frink,"Well, sure, the Frinkiac 7 looks impressive -- Don't touch it. But I predict that within one hundred years, computers will be twice as powerful, ten thousand times larger, and so expensive that only the five richest kings of Europe will own them."
Young Apu,Could it be used for dating?
Young Frink,"Well, theoretically, yes. But -- the computer matches would be so perfect, as to eliminate the thrill of romantic conquest."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Nine glorious years later, I completed my Ph.D. thesis."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"200,000 precisely-ordered punch cards comprising the world's very first tic-tac-toe program. Only the top human players could beat it."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, what's this one for?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,
Marge Simpson,"So Apu, why didn't you go back to India when your student visa expired?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I did not feel right leaving without paying off my student loans.
Marge Simpson,Uh-huh.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"So I took a job at the Kwik-E-Mart. When my debts were wiped clean, I was all set to go, but by then I had made so many friends here."
Marge Simpson,"What you're saying is so understandable... and really, your only crime was violating U.S. law."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, you are one of the good ones."
Marge Simpson,"You know what? I'm going to vote ""no"" on 24."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, you're the greatest. Can I have this licorice?"
,
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Uh, good evening, young man. My name is Charles Norwood. Furthermore to this beer, I would also like three of your finest, cheapest cigars. Here's my I.D., which confirms my adultivity."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Hey, Kearney, this fake I.D., it is truly excellent."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Say, if you tell me where you obtained it, I'll overlook the ice cream sandwiches concealed in your armpits. Eh?"
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Deal.
,
Fat Tony,"Okay, here are your fraudulent documents, Mr. Nahasapeemapetilan: your U.S. Passport, social security card, birth certificate, and your death certificate... just hold onto that one in your safe deposit box."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Most humble and grateful thanks to you.
Fat Tony,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can the courtesy, you're an American now. Remember: you were born in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Your parents were Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilan. And if you do not wish to arouse suspicion, I strongly urge you to act American."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Hey there, Homer, how's it hangin'?"
Homer Simpson,"Low and lazy, so -- Hey! Say something again."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, you're just noticing the way I'm talking to you now. You see, it turns out I am an American citizen after all."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Apparently, I just plumb forgot about it. Say, let's take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. The NY Mets are my favorite squadron."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh yeah, what was I thinking with that? Who needs the infinite compassion of Ganesha when I've got Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman staring at me from ""Entertainment Weekly"" with their dead eyes?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Look at me. I've betrayed my Indian heritage, Sir. What would my parents think of me now?"
Tom Cruise,"Make us proud, son."
Nicole Kidman,Never forget who you are.
Cat,Don't make the same mistake I did.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, forgive me, Mother, Father, I failed you!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Who am I kidding. I am no citizen. This passport is a cheap forgery. A cheap two thousand dollar forgery.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I have brought shame to my parents, to my homeland, and to myself."
Homer Simpson,Don't forget Ganesha.
Lisa Simpson,There was an amnesty declared for people who've been here as long as you! That means you can take the citizenship test!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I cannot deny my roots and I can not keep up this charade. I only did it because I love this land, where I have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever I want. I want to stay, but as the real me -- not as some yahoo from Green Bay."
Homer Simpson,"Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
Homer Simpson,I never should have bought this button. Can I have my three dollars back?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Store credit only.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, look what I brought home."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer. Are you rounding up immigrants?"
Homer Simpson,"No, Marge. Apu convinced me that Proposition 24 is a big mistake."
Lisa Simpson,"All right! Now you've got all the Simpsons behind you, Apu!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"That's nice, although three of you are below voting age."
Homer Simpson,And I'm not registered!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I do appreciate your concern, really, but it is hopeless. The latest poll shows a whooping 85% support for Proposition 24."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Apu, why don't just marry some American broad, then dump her after you get your citizenship?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Selma? Selma my dear? How are you? Uh-huh... uh-huh... uh-huh... Listen, shut up for a second. How would you like to marry Apu so he doesn't get deported?"
Selma Bouvier,"I'd rather eat poison. My name's already Selma Bouvier Terwilliger Hutz McClure. God knows it's long enough without Nahasapeemapeti-whatever. From now on, I'm only marrying for love. And possibly once more for money."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, listen, it is hopeless. Poor Apu...."
Grampa Simpson,"Hey, the government don't control the sky. What if you lived in a balloon?"
Lisa Simpson,That's it!
Bart Simpson,"Didja hear that, Mom? She's as dumb as me!"
Lisa Simpson,"No, not what he said -- what he is. Grandfather. As in ""grandfather clause"". Apu, how long ago did your visa expire?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Seven years, but I don't--"
Marge Simpson,"But Apu, the vote on Proposition 24 is Tuesday. You'll have to pass the test before then."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Oh no. That is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of American history.
Homer Simpson,"Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor."
Homer Simpson,Please identify this object.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,It appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year.
Homer Simpson,Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date. The library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after New Mexico became a state but before Arizona did.
Homer Simpson,Uh... partial credit.
Homer Simpson,"Now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the U.S, so let's do that. Uh, Springfield, Springfield... Ah, right here."
Lisa Simpson,"Da-ad! You're not pointing anywhere near Springfield. It's over here, Apu."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, whatcha doin -- studyin'?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I'm so confused! I don't even know where I'm getting kicked out of anymore.
,
Lou,"Sign's floatin' away, Chief."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"...Executive, legislative, and, uh, judicial."
Homer Simpson,"No, no, and no. Maybe we should start all over with the electrical college."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Please, Mr. Simpson, my brain needs sleep. The test is in six hours, and many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me."
Homer Simpson,"Sleep is for the weak, Apu! Now I'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Okay, Apu: stay awake and stay focused. ""Cotton Mather..."""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Oh no! I fell asleep. I have forgotten everything that Mr. Homer taught me!
Lisa Simpson,Perfect. Let's roll.
,
,
Sales Kid,"Dude, Karma."
Homer Simpson,What?
Chief Wiggum,"Alright men, here's the order of deportations. First we'll be rounding up your tired, then your poor, then your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."
Eddie,Breathers -- got it.
,
I.N.S. AGENT,"All right, here's your last question: What was the cause of the Civil War?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Actually, there were numerous causes. Aside from the obvious schism between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists, economic factors both domestic and international played a significant--"
I.N.S. AGENT,Hey...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,What?
I.N.S. AGENT,Just say slavery.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Slavery it is, Sir."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes! I'm a citizen! Now, which way to the welfare office?"
I.N.S. AGENT,What?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work. I work."
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Thank you. I want to say thank you to everyone. From this day forth, I am no longer an Indian living in America. I am an Indian-American!"
Lisa Simpson,"You know, Apu, in a way, all Americans are immigrants -- except Native Americans."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, native Americans like us."
Lisa Simpson,"No, I mean American Indians."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Like me.
Lisa Simpson,"No, I mean--"
Homer Simpson,"Hi, everyone. If I could just say a few words... I'd be a better public speaker."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Now that you're all relaxed... Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
Homer Simpson,They're writing the operas that entertain us every day...
Homer Simpson,"They're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society."
Homer Simpson,"If we pass Proposition 24, we'll be losing some of the truest Americans of all."
Mob,"He's right! / You said it, Homer! / etc."
Homer Simpson,"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!"
Homer Simpson,NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO ON 24! NO - ON - TWEN - TY - FOUR!
Kent Brockman,It's a landslide: Yes on 24! The Proposition passed with a record 95 percent--
,
Homer Simpson,When are people going to learn -- Democracy doesn't work!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Please don't knock the land that I love. Jury duty! Oh. Today, I am truly an American citizen."
Marge Simpson,Just thank heaven everything worked out for the people we care about.
,
Groundskeeper Willie,Ach. Ingrates.
,
Otto Mann,"Wow. You know, most of my life I've... I've had to live with the shame of being a screw-up. But now, as I stand here with the award for the district's Safest Bus Driver, well it's -- it's like a dream come true."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Otto, wake up!"
Otto Mann,Huh?
,
Otto Mann,
Jasper Beardly,
Otto Mann,"So, um, who's good at keeping secrets?"
,
Marge Simpson,"""Dear parents. Due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. By reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."""
Homer Simpson,Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!
Lisa Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"So how 'bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?"
Bart Simpson,Dad?
Homer Simpson,"Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?"
Bart Simpson,Dad?
Homer Simpson,"I see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""..."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad? Please just drive the car, Dad."
Sales Teen,Hullabalooza is a music festival -- the greatest music festival of all time.
Homer Simpson,"I'm watching the road, sweetie. ""You jiiive turkey!"" See? You got to ""sass"" it. ""Quit jiiiving me, turkey!"" You gotta ""sass"" it. A turkey is a bad person."
Radio,"K-F-S-L! ""Fossil"" 103. Classic hits from ""Abba"" to ""Zeppelin, comma Led."""
Nelson Muntz,Tell him.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir? Can you please change the radio station?"
Homer Simpson,"But this is Grand Funk Railroad! You guys back there know Grand Funk, right?"
Kids,
Homer Simpson,"Nobody knows the band, Grand Funk? The wild shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner? The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher? The competent drumwork of Don Brewer? Oh, man."
Homer Simpson,"For more information on Grand Funk, consult your school library!"
,
Homer Simpson,"And when I listen to a really good song, I start nodding my head, like I'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""Yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" And then sometimes I switch it up like ""No, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""
Bart Simpson,"Dad, please. You're embarrassing us."
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music."
Homer Simpson,"Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft..."
Bart Simpson,"Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!"
Homer Simpson,I'm just trying to party with you guys.
Bart Simpson,"Homer, first of all it's ""par-tay."" And second, we wouldn't par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hi there! Been a while since I set foot in Good Vibrations Music. Where can I find the latest releases by ""Bread?"""
Sales Teen,Oldies.
Homer Simpson,Oldies?
Homer Simpson,"But you've got all the top bands in here. Styx? I just heard them on ""The King Biscuit Flour Hour."" Now here are some of your no-name bands: Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, Hullabalooza..."
Sales Kid,Karma. Karma.
Homer Simpson,"There can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the US Festival."
Sales Teen,The what festival?
Homer Simpson,The US Festival! Geez! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers.
Sales Teen,What Computers?
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact.
,
First Cool Guy,"Quadraphonic sound, a waterbed, and now a strobe light. Gentlemen, say hello to the Second-Base mobile."
All Other Guys,Wicked!
Homer Simpson,"Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible."
,
Girl,"I think you're cool, Homer Simpson."
Second Girl,"Sandra, that was mean."
Homer Simpson,"But most of all, I remember the music."
,
Homer Simpson,You make me feel like dancing...
Barney Gumble,I wanna dance the night away!
Grampa Simpson,What the hell are you two doing?
Barney Gumble,It's called rocking out.
Homer Simpson,"You wouldn't understand, Dad. You're not with it."
Grampa Simpson,"I used to be ""with it."" But then they changed what ""it"" was. Now what I'm with isn't ""it,"" and what's ""it"" seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you."
Homer Simpson,"No way, man. We're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever..."
,
Homer Simpson,Forever... forever... forever...
Marge Simpson,"What's wrong, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,"I went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music I'd never heard of. It was like the store had gone crazy."
Marge Simpson,"Record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it doesn't upset me. Music is none of my business."
B-Real,"Before we start -- We have a lost child here. If she is not claimed within the next hour, she will become the property of Blockbuster Entertainment."
Homer Simpson,"That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, good. Try to include Bart and Lisa."
,
Bart Simpson,"Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today, we promise to build several churches in your honor."
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, no!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, wait! I'm okay today! My mom bought me deodorant!"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you forgot to pick up Milhouse!"
Homer Simpson,I did? I must be getting forgetful in my old age. Open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
Lisa Simpson,What are you talking about?
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Well... what have we here? Looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to Hullabalooza.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, these look real."
Bart Simpson,Check the authenticator spot.
Ticket,"This is an authentic Hullabalooza ticket. For authentic refreshment, eat Clark Bars. And for totally outrageous class rings, it's Josten's. Gooooo, Josten's!"
Homer Simpson,"You're not going to school today. Today, your classroom will be the Capitol City Amphitheater. Your teacher? Four dozen rock bands. So get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. Woo hoo!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, it's like Woodstock. Only with advertisements everywhere and tons of security guards."
Ticket Taker,"People, have your tickets out. Throw your cameras out. Surrender all identification."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my homemade Kahlua."
Lisa Simpson,"Generation X may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, a freak show!"
Blockhead,Thank you. Thank you very much. And now the band you've all been waiting for... Cypress Hill!
Crowd,
Bart Simpson,What is that smell?
Lisa Simpson,It smells like Otto's jacket.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I get it."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born."
Lisa Simpson,Wearing a Jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
Homer Simpson,"Well, excuuuuuuse me!"
Bart Simpson,"You know what, Dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while."
Homer Simpson,"Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people."
Homer Simpson,Alright. Yeah.
Homer Simpson,"Cool concert, am I right?"
Sour Kid,"Yeah, nice try, narc!"
Many Kids,Where's the Narc! / Who? / That fat Jamaican guy.
Homer Simpson,What did I say? What's going on?
Sour Kid #2,"Hey, we're just trying to have a good time, narc. Why do you want to destroy us?"
Sour Girl,Don't commit your hate crimes here. Hate crime!
Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm heading out now! More butt support! More butt support!"
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, making teenagers depressed is like shootin' fish in a barrel."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise."
Homer Simpson,I'll never be part of the scene again!
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh.
Roadie,"Oh man, there goes Peter Frampton's big finale. He's gonna be pissed off."
Peter Frampton,You're damn right I'm gonna be pissed off. I bought that pig at Pink Floyd's yard sale.
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, are you okay?"
Homer Simpson,I'm fine.
Manager,"Sir, I run Hullabalooza's Pageant of the Trans-Mundane -- the freak show -- and I've been looking for a big fatso to shoot with a cannon. I'd like very much for you to be that fatso."
,
Marge Simpson,So you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
Homer Simpson,"I don't think I have a choice, Marge."
Marge Simpson,Of course you have a choice.
Homer Simpson,How do you figure?
Marge Simpson,You don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, in some ways you and I are very different people..."
,
Manager,"And now, get ready for the man...with the iron stomach!"
Homer Simpson,"Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?"
Homer Simpson,Thank you. Thank you very much.
Homer Simpson,"""Stay in school. Your hero, Homer."""
Billy Corgan,"Hey, Cannonball -- I like your statement: When life takes a cheap shot at you, you stand your ground. Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins."
Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson, smiling politely. You know, my kids think you're the greatest. And thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future I can't possibly provide."
Billy Corgan,"Well, we try to make a difference."
,
Bart Simpson,Dear Bart and Lisa...
Homer Simpson,All is well on tour with America's most popular alternative music festival...
Homer Simpson,Our first job is to entertain...
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,...and I like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"But the main thing is, I've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Peter Frampton,
Sonic Youth,
Cypress Hill,
Smashing Pumpkins,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hello, ticket-holders!"
First Gen-x Kid,"Oh, here comes that cannonball guy. He's cool."
Second Gen-x Kid,"Are you being sarcastic, dude?"
First Gen-x Kid,I don't even know anymore.
Homer Simpson,"Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!"
Crowd,
Peter Frampton,"Thanks, Homer. Homer Simpson everyone!"
Billy Corgan,"Hey, Homer, looks like our next stop is your hometown, Springfield."
D'arcy,Is it true that we have to bring our own water?
,
Jimmy Chamberlin,"The hometown show's the big one, Homer."
James Iha,"Yeah, people who called you a weirdo in high school get to see what a successful freak you've become."
D'arcy,Hey -- I wasn't a weirdo. I was in the Audio Visual Club.
Homer Simpson,"Really? Me, too. But I got kicked out 'cause of my views on Vietnam. Also, I was stealing projectors."
Homer Simpson,"Anyway, get ready, beer belly! We're gonna show Springfield what we're made of!"
Smashing Pumpkins,"Alright, Homer! / etc."
Homer Simpson,That was odd.
Manager,Gee. I don't like the sound of that.
Homer Simpson,No biggie. I'm cool.
Manager,"Homer, nothing's more important to me than the health and well-being of my freaks. I'm sending you to a vet."
,
Veterinarian,"My God. Those cannonballs have practically demolished your stomach. From now on, no cannonballs, no spicy foods, and when you lie in a hammock, please -- rest your beer on your head or your genitals."
Homer Simpson,Rules. I'm a rocker. I don't care for rules.
Veterinarian,"Mr. Simpson, this is serious. If you take one more cannonball to the gut... you will die!"
Homer Simpson,"Die? Well, you don't scare me, Doc. 'Cause dying would be a stone groove. Got any messages for Jimi Hendrix?"
Veterinarian,"Yes, pick up your puppy."
,
Bart Simpson,"So what's it like being famous, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,"People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?"
Homer Simpson,Nope.
Bart Simpson,What religion are you?
Homer Simpson,"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity."
Homer Simpson,What's with all the questions?
Bart Simpson,"Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie?"
Homer Simpson,"Sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do."
Homer Simpson,
,
Security Guard,Clear the way. Clear the way. Performer coming through.
Marge Simpson,This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play.
Bart Simpson,Mo-om!
B-Real,Haw-haw!
Roadie,"Hello, bands. Who is playing with the London Symphony Orchestra? C'mon, people, somebody ordered the London Symphony Orchestra... possibly while high. Cypress Hill, I'm looking in your direction."
Cypress Hill,"Hey, man, did we order an orchestra? Uh, I don't know... I think we gotta do somethin'."
DJ Muggs,"Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, we think we did. Uh, do you know ""Insane in the Brain""?"
London Orchestra Guy,We mostly know classical. But we could give it a shot.
Marge Simpson,Now this I like.
FRAMPTON'S GUITAR,Do you feel... like we do.
Jimbo Jones,"Man, that guy's guitar is talkin'!"
Otto Mann,"Hey! My shoes are talkin', too!"
Otto's Left Shoe,"Don't worry, we won't hurt you."
Otto's Right Shoe,We only want to have some fun.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to think, Smithers -- you laughed when I bought Ticketmaster. ""Nobody's going to pay a 100% service charge."""
Waylon Smithers,"Well, it's a policy that ensures a healthy mix of the rich and the ignorant, Sir."
Peter Frampton,Do you feel like we do?! Springfield... Yeah!
Peter Frampton,"Do... wait... Do you... do you feel... do... do you feel...? oh, come on... Do you feel?"
Homer Simpson,...so I realized that being with my family is more important than being cool.
Maggie Simpson,
Peter Frampton,"Ah, Homer Simpson wrecks my pig. Cypress Hill steals my orchestra. And Sonic Youth's in my cooler! Get outta there, you kids!"
Thurston Moore,"Aw c'mon, Mr. Frampton, you're not gonna eat all that watermelon."
Peter Frampton,"Please, I'm trying to perform."
Steve Shelley,Go ahead. We'll stay here and guard your cooler.
Peter Frampton,
Manager,"And now, Springfield, this is the moment that you've been waiting for... The man who embodies everything about rock 'n' roll, except the music. Give it up for your very own homegrown hero -- Homer -- Simpson!"
Milhouse Van Houten,I used to carpool with that guy.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is heavy. Okay, Homer, don't fear the Reaper."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm gonna die."
Marge Simpson,Cannons are designed to hurt. They're designed to hurt.
Lisa Simpson,"Shh, Mom. Dad needs our support."
Bart Simpson,You're the coolest dad alive!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. I thought I had an appetite for destruction, but all I wanted was a club sandwich."
Marge Simpson,There might be one in this cooler.
Marge Simpson,Oh. Here we go.
Peter Frampton,
Lee Ranaldo,"Aw, man. Homer wussed out. I'm so disillusioned."
Kim Gordon,"Hey, Hullabalooza isn't about freaks. It's about music and advertising and youth-oriented product positioning."
Sen-Dog,That and getting toasted. Nicely toasted.
Manager,"Homer, I'm sorry. There's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied freak, unless that's his act. I expect your letter of resignation on my desk."
Homer Simpson,You have a desk?
Manager,I mean the hood of my car.
Homer Simpson,"I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for."
Billy Corgan,"We envy you, Homer. All we have is our music, our legions of fans, our millions of dollars, and our youth."
Billy Corgan,Woo Hoo!
James Iha,Let's all go out and buy fur coats!
Jimmy Chamberlin,I want a walk-in humidor.
,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, what you just said was powerfully un-cool."
Homer Simpson,"You know what the song says, ""It's hip to be square."""
Lisa Simpson,That song is so lame.
Homer Simpson,So lame that it's cool?
Lisa Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,"Am I cool, kids?"
Lisa Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,"Good. I'm glad. And that's what makes me cool -- not caring, right?"
Lisa Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,"Well, how the hell do you be cool? I feel like we've tried everything here."
Homer Simpson,"Wait, Marge. Maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool."
Bart Simpson,"Well, sure you do."
Lisa Simpson,How else would you know?
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart, summer's almost here. Which kind of sprinkler do you like: the one that goes like this? Or the one that goes like this?! Oh, and there's this one!"
Bart Simpson,"It's the last day of school, Milhouse. Try to show some dignity."
Ice Cream Truck Supervisor,"Gentlemen, start your chimes..."
Milhouse Van Houten,"School's out! Up yours, Krabappel!"
Edna Krabappel,"Well, I'm glad the rest of you remembered that summer vacation starts at the end of the day, not the beginning."
Lou,"Here you go, Ma'am."
Edna Krabappel,Hmm. Quick work. How'd you know he was gonna run?
Lou,We've got someone on the inside.
Martin Prince,
Lisa Simpson,The reward for a year's worth of toil and sacrifice: Retrospecticus.
Lisa Simpson,Oops.
Girls,
Nerdy Girl,"The Leatheroleum covers were worth the extra money! Oh, you can smell the benzene!"
OTHER NERDY GIRL,"Oh, when the kids see these layouts and fonts, you're going to be the most popular girl in school!"
Lisa Simpson,"You know something, BeeZee? I think you're right."
,
Miss Hoover,"And so as Abraham Lincoln sat in Ford's Theater that night, John Wilkes Booth entered, drew his gun and..."
Miss Hoover,"Well, that's it. Have a nice summer, everyone."
Chuck,But what happened in Ford's theater?
Ralph Wiggum,Was President Lincoln okay?
Miss Hoover,He was fine.
Miss Hoover,"Go home, Ralph."
Lisa Simpson,"In the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. I hope everyone still has theirs."
Kids,
Nelson Muntz,Who died and made you boss?
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Estes, the publications advisor. I edited the whole thing."
Nelson Muntz,"If you hadn't done it, some other loser would have! So quit milkin' it!"
Kids,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, will you guys sign my yearbook?"
Lisa Simpson,Wha?
Milhouse Van Houten,"This is Becky, she's in the second grade."
Bart Simpson,"Hi, Becky. Thanks for comin' out."
Becky,See ya! He writes the way people talk!
Bart Simpson,Your daughter is named Seymour?
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I... I lied -- it's for me."
Lisa Simpson,"I don't get it. Straight A's, perfect attendance, Bathroom Timer... I should be the most popular girl in school."
,
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. I was all set to go off on vacation, when I get called up for jury duty. Oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
,
Homer Simpson,I only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?
Ned Flanders,"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
Homer Simpson,"Deal. See, Flanders, you give a little, you get a little."
Ned Flanders,"Hello, ""Mr. Brown Ground"", whatcha got for me?"
Marge Simpson,"... And you're sure the Flanderses won't be there? Well, it sounds great!"
Marge Simpson,"Bart, you can invite Milhouse. Lisa, you can bring a friend, too."
Lisa Simpson,"Heyyy, great, a friend... or a companion... ... stuffed animal..."
Marge Simpson,"Well, did you call one of your friends?"
Lisa Simpson,Friends? Hah! These are my only friends...
Lisa Simpson,Grown-up nerds like Gore Vidal. And even he's kissed more boys than I ever will.
Marge Simpson,"Girls, Lisa. Boys kiss girls."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, why don't I have any friends?"
Marge Simpson,"We have each other! When I was a lonely little girl, I always dreamed that someday my daughter would be my best friend."
Lisa Simpson,"We are best friends, Mom. But I'm a kid. I need friends my own age, too."
Marge Simpson,"Honey, you'll make plenty of friends. All you have to do is be yourself."
Lisa Simpson,Be myself? I've been myself for eight years and it hasn't worked. Look at all these dorky clothes... A bathing cap... nose plugs...
Lisa Simpson,"A microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was I thinking?"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'm gonna tighten Milhouse's straps. He's fidgeting again."
Milhouse Van Houten,
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, let's go!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey. Hmm, somebody's travelin' light."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe you're getting stronger.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I have been eating more..."
Marge Simpson,"Wave bye-bye to our house, Maggie. Bye-bye, tree."
Homer Simpson,"Bye-bye, job."
Bart Simpson,Bye-bye toothbrush.
Lisa Simpson,Bye-bye Lisa Simpson.
,
Bart Simpson,When the hell are we gonna get to... where the hell are we going?
Marge Simpson,"It's called Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport. It's known as ""America's scrod-basket."""
Bart Simpson,I thought Springfield was America's scrod-basket.
Marge Simpson,"No, Springfield is ""America's crud-bucket."" At least according to Newsweek."
Homer Simpson,"""Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons."" Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly."""
Marge Simpson,That was thoughtful.
Homer Simpson,I left a few helpful notes around the house...
Marge Simpson,Put food in me.
Homer Simpson,I'll take that.
Marge Simpson,"Well, duh! With what, Ned?"
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Nice try, Todd."
,
Marge Simpson,"Isn't this fun, honey?"
Lisa Simpson,It must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
Marge Simpson,"I know you're joking -- but it is! Say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's kind of funny... with all the craziness and confusion and mishegoss of packing... Ha... I forgot to pack."
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, that's not at all like you."
Lisa Simpson,Exactly.
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"I forgot my swimsuit, too. But I improvised."
Homer Simpson,Hello.
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, Mom, I'm kinda trying to go for a different look this year."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, okay."
Marge Simpson,"Ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. It has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail!"
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, come here. Bring money."
Marge Simpson,So where do you want to show off your new hip togs? The Sherbet Shoppe? The Candle District? Big Sue's Tap Water Taffy?
Lisa Simpson,"Um, if it's okay with you, Mom, I'd rather go find some kids."
Marge Simpson,Oh... okay.
Marge Simpson,You'll be my friend. I'm never gonna let you get away.
,
Bart Simpson,Last one in is a yearbook editor!
Milhouse Van Houten,Full speed ahead. Prepare to dive! Dive!
Milhouse Van Houten,
Homer Simpson,"It's low tide, boys."
,
Lisa Simpson,I wonder where all the kids are.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, a library! No, I can't. That's the old nerdy Lisa."
Pippi Longstocking,"Lisa, read about my adventures in the South Seas -- and make me live again."
Eustace Tilley,We've got periodicals on microfiche!
Alice,"Won't you join our tea party? It will be ever so -- Don't do it, Lisa, it's a trick!"
Alice,Run! Run!
,
Lisa Simpson,I don't see any kids at all. It's like they ditched me in advance.
COOL KID VOICE,"So he goes, like ."
COOL GIRL VOICE,I can totally hear him going that.
Lisa Simpson,Only kids are that incoherent!
,
Rick,"So my mom tried to take me to some candle place, but I'm all, like, no way."
Lisa Simpson,"Like, you know, whatever. Like, you know, whatever."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, what's hap--"
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, okay, okay... not your fault, it's a bird thing. You don't control the birds -- you will someday, but not now."
Lisa Simpson,Hi.
Kid,'Sup.
Rick,Who's that?
Kid,I'unno. Some kid.
Erin,"Hey, I like your hat."
Lisa Simpson,A compliment!
Lisa Simpson,Thanks. Umm... You guys skate?
Rick,"Try to, but cops always confiscate our boards."
Erin,"Yeah, and you just know they're using them like five minutes later down at the station."
Lisa Simpson,I think I know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted.
Kids,
Lisa Simpson,"Like, you know, whatever."
Kids,
,
Erin,"Hey, this place rocks. What'd you say your name was?"
Lisa Simpson,Didn't. It's Lisa.
Erin,I'm Erin. So how'd you know about this place? Y'into books?
,
Lisa Simpson,Me? Unlikely. My goony brother's always going to libraries. I usually hang out in front.
Erin,"Oh, you like hangin' out, too?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, it beats doing stuff."
Erin,"Yeah, stuff sucks."
Rick,"Hey, you up? You can use my board."
Lisa Simpson,"Okay... thanks. That's very, uh... ""rad"" of you."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart, Lisa's skateboarding with some cool kids! And she looks like Blossom!"
Bart Simpson,"Lisa? With people? If they're impressed by her, I'm gonna Bart their world. Okay, Milhouse, you know the drill."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Right. You go over and wow them, I hide in the shrubs."
Bart Simpson,Hot stuff comin' through!
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,My friendship. You know you want it.
Rick,"The kid, like, tries too hard."
Dean,"Yeah, the whole thing smacks of effort, man."
Lisa Simpson,"That's my dorky little brother, Bart --tholomew."
Erin,"Like, who does he think he is with that slingshot in his back pocket? Dennis the Menace?"
Kids,
,
Milhouse Van Houten,How'd it go? Are we down with them?
Bart Simpson,No. They must have seen you.
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game?"
Marge Simpson,"Because it was the only one in the house. Come on, Homer, open the door for your Mystery Date!"
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge."
,
Marge Simpson,"You got ""The Dud!"""
,
Bart Simpson,How come Lisa doesn't have to play? Why does she get to hang out with her friends?
Homer Simpson,"You've got friends. You got ""The Dud"" right here. Stand up for yourself, Poindexter!"
Erin,"Wow, Lisa, I never appreciated all this like... sea junk before."
Rick,"Hey, that clam's got legs."
Lisa Simpson,"That's a hermit crab. When she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit."
Lisa Simpson,"Don't be afraid, little friend. You'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
Lisa Simpson,"Aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean."
Dean,"Um, did you learn that word from a teacher or something?"
Lisa Simpson,"No. No, I heard it on ""Baywatch."""
Kids,
Homer Simpson,"Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time."
,
Homer Simpson,"Um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of Old Harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. No, make it two."
Apu II,"My apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks is prohibited in this state and is punishable by--"
Apu II,Follow me.
Apu II,"Any red-blooded, flag-fearing American would love the M-320. Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it."
Homer Simpson,All right.
,
Rick,'Pretty cool of your mom to let us hang out here.
Erin,Totally. Not like my mom. She'd be butting in with rice crispie squares and Tang.
Rick,My dad's all stoked 'cause today's the Fourth of July. He woke me up at dawn to take a loyalty oath.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Well, we could do something fun. Um, how 'bout a beach party?"
Erin,"Great idea, Lis."
Rick,"Yeah, I know where there's a beach!"
Dean,I know where we can get some baguettes!
Marge Simpson,"Gee, I don't know what you've got planned for tonight, Homer, but count me out. Didn't you buy any meat?"
Bart Simpson,"Check this out: ""Miss Perfect Attendance""."
Homer Simpson,"This baby's sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches."
Bart Simpson,Fresh out.
Homer Simpson,No lighter?... Nothin'?
Homer Simpson,"Wait, I got it."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,The beer!
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, this is the worst Fourth of July ever. I hate America! Come on, Milhouse, let's go down there."
Marge Simpson,I don't think you should. Let Lisa be alone with her new friends.
Bart Simpson,"They're my friends, rightfully. She only got them by copying me!"
Lisa Simpson,"Don't have a cow, man!"
Kids,
Bart Simpson,See?! That's my expression!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, you haven't said that in four years. Let Lisa have it."
Bart Simpson,It's the principle. She's gotta learn!
Marge Simpson,"No! Now park your keister, meester!"
Lisa Simpson,Aye carumba!
Kids,
,
Erin,"Hey, Lis, I made something for ya."
Erin,It's a friendship bracelet.
Lisa Simpson,"For me? Wow, my first real friend... ...ship bracelet. I don't have anything for you... ...except this necklace I made."
Erin,"Oh, cool. Thanks, Lisa. Hey, cinnamon dental floss!"
Lisa Simpson,I just know we're gonna be friends forever.
Bart Simpson,So Lisa has a friend. We'll see about that.
Milhouse Van Houten,Bart! I need my glasses!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, nice doggie."
,
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,What's he doing here?
Lisa Simpson,My yearbook! No!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, you guys! You wanna see how cool Lisa Simpson really is?"
Bart Simpson,Grammar Rodeo -- Head Buccaroo.
Bart Simpson,The French Table -- ooh la la.
Erin,Teachers' Pet?
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis."
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"I guess my little yearbook stunt was pretty rough, but it did teach you a lesson: It's important to be yourself."
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"I know exactly who I am. I am the sister of a rotten, jealous, mean little sneak."
Lisa Simpson,You cost me my only friends! You ruined my life!
Marge Simpson,"Hey, kids, there's a carnival tonight!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh boy, a carnival!"
,
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Kids! Stop that! Don't make me get the carney!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lisa, make friends with this!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey!
Milhouse Van Houten,Hellllp! Hellllp!
Marge Simpson,"Remember, kids, there's no need to bump! Just enjoy the ride!"
,
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, wait!"
,
Lisa Simpson,Being myself didn't work... Being someone else didn't work... Maybe I just wasn't meant to have friends.
Rick,Lisa is gonna freak when she sees this.
Erin,"Well, hurry up. They'll be back soon."
Erin,Lisa!
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, you found out I'm an over-achieving bookworm. So whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a Polaroid. I'm going to sleep."
Dean,"Wait, Lisa. Look."
Rick,"Cool, huh?"
Ben,Now you can take the beach with you wherever you go!
Rick,Uh... But don't drive at night.
Lisa Simpson,Does this mean you still want to be friends? Even though I tried to cover up my nerdish... leanings?
Erin,"Look, we don't care who you were. You can't fake the kind of good person you are."
Lisa Simpson,"Ohmigod, Bart, look!"
Dean,Yeah. You taught us about cool things like nature and why we shouldn't drink sea water.
Lisa Simpson,This is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
Homer Simpson,Sweet merciful crap! My car!
,
Marge Simpson,"The polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. Shoo, shoo!"
Bart Simpson,I guess I should give this back to you.
Bart Simpson,I showed it to your friends again before we left.
Lisa Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,Look inside.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh. Thanks, Bart."
Milhouse Van Houten,I signed it too!
Lisa Simpson,Uh huh.
Homer Simpson,"Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Did you hear that, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Maybe it was just the cat.
Lisa Simpson,No. She's sleeping with
Lisa Simpson,me.
Snowball II,
Bart Simpson,Did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. I'll go feed it."
Homer Simpson,"Fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo..."
Homer Simpson,
Something,
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,What's up there? / Is it a monster? / We have to know! / What's the secret?
Homer Simpson,No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?
Marge Simpson,"Three! We have three kids, Homer!"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, three nosy kids. And you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?"
BART & LISA,"No, what? / What? / Tell us, what happens? / Does something happen?"
Lisa Simpson,Hurry up! Mom and Dad'll be home soon!
Bart Simpson,The unsold copies of Dad's autobiography.
"Hulking, Shambling Figure",
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, do you think it's safe?"
Bart Simpson,I don't care. I can't breathe in here.
Maggie Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"See, Marge? Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain."
Lisa Simpson,MomDadWeSawSomethingInTheAtticAnd --
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God, Marge, it's escaped!"
Marge Simpson,"Yes, Doctor, it's what we've always feared: it's loose. Hugo is loose. See you soon."
Bart Simpson,Who or what is Hugo?
Marge Simpson,"I'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, Bart. You see... you have a brother."
Lisa Simpson,So I have two brothers?
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, please. Yes, Bart, you have a twin brother. You see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,A monstrous irregularity.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Yes, I remember Bart's birth well. You don't forget a thing like... Siamese twins."
Lisa Simpson,"I believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins."""
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"And hillbillies prefer to be called ""sons of the soil,"" but it ain't gonna happen. Now normally, the birth of Siamese twins is a joyous occasion... But unfortunately, one of them was pure evil."
Marge Simpson,I think I'll bottle-feed that one.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,A routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. It was then I knew the only option was to separate you two immediately.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,You'll both need to sign these.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boys Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town, the child was an outcast. So we did the only humane thing."
Homer Simpson,We chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
Marge Simpson,It saved our marriage!
Bart Simpson,"You expect me to believe all this? If any of it was true, wouldn't I have a big, hideous scar..."
Bart Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,We've got to find Hugo.
Homer Simpson,"We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
Lisa Simpson,I'll start with Radio Shack.
Homer Simpson,"Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game."
Bart Simpson,"You're here, aren't you?"
Hugo,"Yes, Bart. I never left you."
Bart Simpson,W-w-what do you want from me?
Hugo,You'll see. After the surgery.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,You're crazy!
Hugo,"Am I? Well, perhaps we're all a little crazy. I know I am. I went mad after they tore us apart. But I'll be sane once I sew us back together."
Bart Simpson,But you'll kill both of us!
Hugo,"No, it's easy. Look, I've been practicing. I made a pigeon-rat..."
Hugo,"Well, let's get started. You want to be on the right or the left?"
Bart Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Hugo, stop!"
,
,
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, don't look so shocked."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, chalk this one up to carelessness on my part. But I think there's a way to set everything right."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Care for a drumstick, Hugo?"
Hugo,
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, Hugo's eating his napkin!"
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, can I have some turkey?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, finish your fish heads. Then we'll talk."
Lisa Simpson,This tooth will be perfect for my science project.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad."
Lisa Simpson,"Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and Chinese food. But I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis. Check out my science project."
Lisa Simpson,Ow! What's that supposed to prove?
Bart Simpson,That nerds conduct electricity.
Lisa Simpson,Ow!
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Ow! Stupid Bart!
Lisa Simpson,Oh boy! Mold! That's science-fair paydirt!
Lisa Simpson,Hmmm. Looks about the same.
Lisa Simpson,Ah.
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Tiny little people!
Lisa Simpson,My God. I've created life!
Marge Simpson,Lisa! Breakfast! We're having waffles!
Lisa Simpson,"Ooo, waffles!"
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, these aren't waffles -- these are just square pancakes!"
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. The waffle iron's in the shop."
Lisa Simpson,That waffle iron's been in the shop forever.
Lisa Simpson,"So, how are my little stone age tub dwellers? Oh my gosh!"
Lisa Simpson,They're evolving so quickly! They've already reached the Renaissance... Wait! One of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral! I've created Lutherans!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, it's almost like seeing into the future!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, what is this goo? Are you trying to grow a friend?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, you built a model city. Is that the school?"
Bart Simpson,"Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped."
Lisa Simpson,Ba-rt stop it!
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, my poor little guys. That Bart is so rude."
,

Bart Simpson,What the heck? Gah!
Bart Simpson,

Bart Simpson,Your micro-jerks attacked me!
Homer Simpson,"Lookin' good, son."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, you practically destroyed their whole world!"
Bart Simpson,"You can't protect them every second. Sooner or later you'll let your guard down, and then -- flush! It's toilet time for tiny town."
Lisa Simpson,

Prof. Mini-Frink,It worked! The debigulator worked!
Crowd,Hail Liiiiiiisaaaaaaa.
Notable,"Welcome to our world, most gracious Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,Your world is incredible! And you speak English!
Notable,"We have listened to you speak since the dawn of time, O Creator, and we have learned to imatoot you exarktly."
Lisa Simpson,You think I'm God?
Notable,But of course. You look down on us from heaven. You gave us life. And only your divine intervention can save us from the devil.
Lisa Simpson,The devil? What devil?
Notable,"The one you call ""Bart."""
Crowd,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no-no-no-no, you don't understand. Bart's just my brother."
Notable,The devil is your brother?
Crowd,
Notable,I must say we find that quite perplexing.
Man,"Uh, God, hi. Bill Watson... I, uh, live in the Clark Building. I have a question. If you're so good, why do you allow bad things to happen?"
Fat Man,Why am I so fat?
Crowd,
Lisa Simpson,"Listen, I can take care of everything. All you have to do is unshrink me."
Prof. Mini-Frink,"Unshrink you? Well that would require some sort of a... ""rebigulator,"" which is a concept so ridiculous it makes me want to laugh out loud and chortle."
Prof. Mini-Frink,"But... Oh, but not at you o holiest of gods with the wrathfulness, and the vengeance, and the blood-rain, and the hey, hey, hey, it hurts me."
Notable,"Look, the destroyer! He returns!"
Crowd,"Help! / Save us, Lisa! / Help us God! / Etc."

Lisa Simpson,"Principal Skinner, wait! I created the universe! Give me the gift certificate!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, great. I'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
Lisa Simpson,Shouldn't you people be groveling? And bring me some shoes. Nice ones!
Man #2,"She'll want socks, too. I'll get socks."

Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish."

Homer Simpson,Oh my God... space aliens! Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat them!
Kang,"Silence. We are travelers from a certain nearby ringed planet whose name we'd prefer not to mention. My name is Kang, and this is my sister, Kodos."
Kodos,Hello.
Homer Simpson,"I suppose you'll want to probe me. Well, might as well get it over with."
Kang,Stop. We have reached the limits of what rectal probing can teach us.
Kodos,This is a mission of conquest. Take us to your leader.
Homer Simpson,"I guess you mean President Clinton. He usually hangs around Washington, D.C."
Kang,President Clin-Ton. Excellent.
Homer Simpson,"Except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. It might be what's-his-name, uh, Mumbly-Joe... uh, I saw him on TV the other... Uh, Bob Dole."
Kang,Hmm... an election. That complicates matters. Set grid coordinates for Bob Dole.
,
Dole,"Well, 'night, everybody."
Committee Staff,"'Night Sir / Good night, Mr. Dole / Good luck next week."
Dole,What? Bob Dole doesn't need this.
,
Dole,What the hell is this -- some kind of tube?
Clinton,"Well, thanks for taking care of Dole for me. I, uh -- Hey!"
Kang,Commence bio-duplication.
Homer Simpson,Oh no. Aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!
KODOS-CLINTON,What? Are you still here? I'm afraid we'll have to dispose of you.
Homer Simpson,No! NO! What are you spraying me with!?
KANG-DOLE,Rum. So no one will believe your story.
KODOS-CLINTON,And don't come back!
,
Kent Brockman,"Kent Brockman here with ""Campaign '96: America Flips A Coin"". At an appearance this morning, President Clinton made some rather cryptic remarks, which aides attributed to an overly tight necktie."
KODOS-CLINTON,"I am Clin-Ton. As overlord, all will kneel trembling before me and obey my brutal commands. End communication."
Marge Simpson,That's Slick Willie for you. Always with the smooth talk.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!"
Bart Simpson,"Sure you were, rummy."
Homer Simpson,That's one of the creatures!
Kent Brockman,"Senator Dole, why should people vote for you instead of President Clinton?"
KANG-DOLE,"It makes no difference which one of us you vote for. Either way, your planet is doomed. DOOMED!"
Kent Brockman,"Well, a refreshingly frank response there from Senator Bob Dole."
Homer Simpson,These candidates make me want to vomit in terror! I've got to stop them!

KANG-DOLE,Hmm... Abortions for some... miniature American flags for others!
Crowd,
,
Marge Simpson,Move us?
KANG-DOLE,Fooling these Earth-voters is easier than expected.
KODOS-CLINTON,Yes. All they want to hear are bland pleasantries embellished by an occasional saxophone-solo or infant kiss.
Aide,"Uh, Mr. President, sir, people are becoming a bit... confused, by the way you and your opponent are, well, constantly holding hands."
KANG-DOLE,"We are merely exchanging long protein strings. If you can think of a simpler way, I'd like to hear it."
,
KODOS-CLINTON,"My fellow Americans: as a young boy, I dreamed of being a baseball. But tonight I say we must move forward, not backward... upward, not forward... and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!"
Homer Simpson,Stop! Those candidates are phonies!
Homer Simpson,You heard me -- They're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
SECRET SERVICEMAN,Don't forget your stinkin' flag.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?"
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Hold on guys. I'll help ya!
Clinton,"Oh, no, am I still here? I don't wanna serve out my term naked in a tube."
Dole,"I am so mad at the secret service right now. Hey, who the hell are you?"
Homer Simpson,"I'm Homer Simpson, Sir, and I'm gonna get you back to Washington before it's too late!"
Clinton,"You know, Senator, being in suspended animation gave me time to think. Partisan politics are tearing our country apart."
Dole,"You've got a point there, Bill. If you and I are gonna whup these one-eyed space fellas, we're gonna have to set aside our differences."
Clinton,Together we can lead America into a new golden age.
Dole,"Friend, you've got a deal. Homer -- let us out! It's time to tear those aliens a third corn-chute."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Oh no! What have I done? What am I doing? What will I do?!
,
Homer Simpson,It's in Cypress Creek. Upstate somewhere.
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. So long, Stinktown."
KANG-DOLE,"The politics of failure have failed. We need to make them work again! Tomorrow, when you are sealed in the voting cubicle, vote for me, Senator Ka... ... Bob Dole!"
KODOS-CLINTON,"I am looking forward to an orderly election tomorrow, which will eliminate the need for a violent bloodbath."
Homer Simpson,"America, take a good look at your beloved candidates! They're nothing but hideous space reptiles!"
Crowd,
Kodos,It's true. We are aliens. But what are you going to do about it? It's a two-party system. You have to vote for one of us!
Crowd,
Man In Crowd,"Well, I believe I'll vote for a third party candidate."
Kang,Go ahead -- throw your vote away!
Kang,
Alien Crier,All hail President Kang!
Marge Simpson,Ow! I don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet I never even heard of.
Homer Simpson,Don't blame me. I voted for Kodos.

Waylon Smithers,I WORK FOR MONTY BURNS! / MUH MUH MUH MUH MUH MUH MUH MONTY BURNS!...
Businesswoman,Mr. Smithers? May we offer you a ride to work?
,
Businesswoman,We're from Globex Corporation. We'd like to talk to you about an exciting employment opportunity in our nuclear division.
Waylon Smithers,"Flattered, but spoken for."
Businesswoman,"We're prepared to offer you an impressive salary, plus health benefits for you and your life partner."
Waylon Smithers,The answer is no! What's wrong with this country?! Can't a man walk down the street without being offered a job?
,
Businesswoman,"We'll have to go to the next most senior man at the plant. Ah, oh, here we are. Ten years experience. His name is..."
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge! I've got a new job! It's with Globex Corporation. I get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. And they'll move us and give us a nice house and..."
Marge Simpson,You took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
Homer Simpson,Of course not. I wouldn't do that. Why not?
Marge Simpson,"We have roots here, Homer. We have friends and family and library cards... Bart's lawyer is here."
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream."
Marge Simpson,What lifelong dream?
Homer Simpson,Promise not to laugh? I always wanted to own the Dallas Cowboys.
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry, Dad. I just find that very cute."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't want to leave Springfield. I've dug myself into a happy little rut here and I'm not about to hoist myself out of it."
Homer Simpson,"Just bring the rut with you, honey. Come on, take a look."
Announcer,Cypress Creek. A tale of one city...
Homer Simpson,"Ah, let's watch something else."
Marge Simpson,Homer! You're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, that's right. Let's watch this."
Woman,Look at this place.
Man,Somebody oughta build a town that works.
Announcer,Somebody did.
,
Announcer,It's called Cypress Creek. A planned community designed for the workers of the Globex Corporation.
Announcer,Cypress Creek. Where dreams come true.
2nd Announcer,"Your dreams may vary from those of Globex Corporation, its subsidiaries, and shareholders."
Homer Simpson,"Well! What do you think of me and Cypress Creek now, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,It does seem nicer than Springfield.
Lisa Simpson,Yeah. Did you notice how the people weren't shoving or knocking each other down? I've never been to a place like that before.
Bart Simpson,Me neither!
Marge Simpson,"Well, we could use the extra money... and this house is falling apart."
Marge Simpson,All right.
Lisa Simpson,Yayyy!
Otto Mann,"Oh, wow, windows. I don't think I can afford this place."
Bart Simpson,"No it hasn't, Dad. That's why we're leaving."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Hello. I am not interested in buying the house, but I would like to use your restroom, flip through your magazines, re-arrange your carefully shelved items, and handle your food products in an unsanitary manner. Ha! Now you know how it feels."
Homer Simpson,Thank you! Come again!
,
Homer Simpson,We'll never sell this rotten dump.
Bart Simpson,"Ah, 'little help here?"
Marge Simpson,"Even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage."
Homer Simpson,Heeeeey...
Ned Flanders,"Uh... Homer... Ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the TV trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in Cypress Creek?"
Homer Simpson,Yes.

Homer Simpson,I'm gonna miss Springfield. This town's been awfully good to us.
Lisa Simpson,It says here one of these giant redwood trees can provide enough sawdust to cover an entire day's worth of vomit at Disneyland.
Lisa Simpson,Oooh! Aaah! Ohhh!
,
Lisa Simpson,Oooh!
Homer Simpson,"Here we are, 15201 Maple Systems Road... Our new home."
,
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,I call this room!
Man,"I am here to welcome you on behalf of the President of the Globex Corporation, me. Try the papayas. They're juicy and full of papayine. Makes you strong. Like Popeye. Popeye, papayine. Popeye, papayine. See, same thing? Same... Ah, forget it. How are ya? I'm Hank Scorpio."
Homer Simpson,Wow! My boss!
Hank Scorpio,Don't call me that word. I don't like things that elevate me above the other people. I'm just like you.
Hank Scorpio,"Aw sure, I come later in the day, I get paid a lot more and I take longer vacations. But I don't like the word ""boss"". Hey, look at my feet."
Homer Simpson,Okay...
Hank Scorpio,You like those moccasins? Look in your closet -- there's a pair for you. Don't like 'em? Then neither do I! Get the hell outta here!
Hank Scorpio,Ha! Ever see a guy say good-bye to a shoe?
Homer Simpson,"Yes, once."
Marge Simpson,"Mr. Scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. I keep expecting to get the bum's rush."
,
Hank Scorpio,"See you at work tomorrow! Although I don't really like to call it ""work""!"
Homer Simpson,Wowww.
Marge Simpson,"Okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol... Annnd Maggie's enjoying her Swingamajig..."
Marge Simpson,"I can't believe it! I've done all my housework and it's only 9:30! Well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made."
,
Hank Scorpio,"You will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual around here."
Homer Simpson,"Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion."
Hank Scorpio,"Don't call me Mr. Scorpion. It's Mr. Scorpi-o. But don't call me that, either. Call me Hank. Uh, say, before we continue our tour, would you mind hanging my coat up on the wall, please?"
Homer Simpson,
Hank Scorpio,"Relax, Homer. At Globex, we don't believe in walls. Matter of fact, I didn't even give you my coat."
Homer Simpson,Wow.
,
Hank Scorpio,"Having a place like this has always been my dream, Homer. What's your dream?"
Homer Simpson,Uh... to work for you?
Hank Scorpio,"Don't do that. My butt is for sitting, not for kissing. Now you tell me the truth -- What's your real dream? Your real dream?"
Homer Simpson,Um... Someday I'd like to own the Dallas Cowboys.
Hank Scorpio,I bet people laughed at you when you told them that dream.
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Hank Scorpio,"Homer, don't give up. They laughed at me the first time I wore jeans with a sport coat. I was the first wealthy man in America to ever do that. Now they all do it!... Didja ever hear of Mike Milken?"
Homer Simpson,Ye... No.
Technicians,
Hank Scorpio,"Now Homer, these gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears and, should the need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body. Your job will be to manage and motivate them. Give them the benefit of your years of experience."
Homer Simpson,Don't worry. That won't take long.
Hank Scorpio,The key to motivation is trust. Lemme show you what I mean.
Hank Scorpio,I want you to close your eyes and fall backwards and I'll catch you. That's gonna show you what trust is all about. Ready?
Homer Simpson,All right.
Hank Scorpio,3... 2....
Hank Scorpio,One second... Hello?
Homer Simpson,Doh!
Hank Scorpio,"Oh my God, that guy's on the floor. Uh, that was a phone call. Don't chalk that up to mistrust, now."
2nd Leg-up Kid,"I fell off the jungle gym, and when I woke up, I was in here."
3RD LEG-UP KID,I start fires!

Homer Simpson,Are you guys working?
Worker #1,"Yes sir, Mr. Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"Could you, um... work any harder than this?"
Worker #1,"Sure thing, boss."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, call me Homer."

Bart Simpson,
Students,
Student In Sunglasses,You got a fresh sound. It'll play well at this school.
Milhouse,"Hey, Bart, do you have a best friend yet? 'Cause I've been looking for someone to boss me around..."
Mr. Doyle,"Okay, folks, let's do it to it. Grammar, that is. Uh, everybody write down this sentence and circle the nouns."
Mr. Doyle,"Bart, as the newest addition to our menagerie, you have the honors."
Bart Simpson,Um... Uh...
Mr. Doyle,"Well, let's start by reading the sentence..."
Bart Simpson,"Two, wintim amd Jawwy wirt..."
,
Mr. Doyle,"So, you never learned cursive?"
Bart Simpson,"Um, well, I know hell and damn and bi--"
Mr. Doyle,Cursive handwriting. Script. Do you know the multiplication tables? Long division?
Bart Simpson,I know of them.
Mr. Doyle,"You know, Bart, I think you'd profit from a more remedial environment. I'm sure you'll feel right at home in... The ""Leg-Up"" Program."
Bart Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,Guess I can't complain. Everything's perfect here.
,
Bart Simpson,"So, what are you in for?"
Leg-up Kid,"I moved here from Canada and they think I'm slow, eh?"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's with you sad sacks?"
Leg-up Teacher,"Okay. Now everyone take out your safety pencil and a circle of paper. This week I hope we can finish our work on the letter ""A."""
Bart Simpson,"Let me get this straight. We're behind the rest of our class, and we're going to catch up to them by going slower than they are?"
Rest Of Class,
Leg-up Teacher,Stop it! Stop it! Warren! Melvin! Gary! Dot! Gordy!
Bart Simpson,"Look, lady, I'm s'posed to be in the fourth grade."
Leg-up Teacher,"Sounds to me like someone's got a case of the ""spose'das."""
Bart Simpson,
Leg-up Teacher,Warren!
Lisa Simpson,Wildflowers! We don't have you in Springfield!
Lisa Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Chipmunk! You're a Northern Reticulated Chipmunk! Yes, you are! You are so reticulated!"
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Mrs. Owl! You're out kind of early!"
Mrs. Owl,
,
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."
Marge Simpson,"I knew you'd do well, Homer."
Bart Simpson,"Sports collectibles! Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat!"
Homer Simpson,"Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! ""To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry."""
Bart Simpson,Why don't you buy it?
Homer Simpson,I can't buy that. Only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. Guys like me? I'm a guy like me!
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, if Tom Landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then I should just quit right now."
Worker #2,"I'm sorry, we're just a little tired, sir. We've been pushing ourselves real hard to get the reactor on-line."
Homer Simpson,"Tired, eh? What you guys need... is hammocks."
Hank Scorpio,"Oh, hi, Homer! What can I do for you?"
Homer Simpson,All right... What's the number?
Homer Simpson,"Sir, I need to know where I can get some business hammocks."
,
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Hank Scorpio,"There's ""Hammocks-R-Us""..."
Homer Simpson,Got it...
Hank Scorpio,"That's on Third, too. You got ""Put Your Butt There""..."
Homer Simpson,Umm-hmmm...
Hank Scorpio,That's on Third.
Homer Simpson,Yes...
Hank Scorpio,"""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot""..."
Homer Simpson,Right...
Hank Scorpio,"That might... Matter of fact, they're all in the same complex. It's the Hammock Complex, down on Third?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the Hammock District."
Hank Scorpio,That's right.
Businesswoman,"Ready for the linkup, Mr. Scorpio."
Hank Scorpio,"Uh, Homer. One second. I gotta take care of this. Very important. 'Be right back."
Homer Simpson,Fine.
Hank Scorpio,"Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Scorpio. I have the doomsday device. You have 72 hours to deliver the gold. Or you face the consequences. And to prove I'm not bluffing, watch this..."
U.N. Member,"Oh, my God! The 59th Street Bridge!"
2nd U.N. Member,Maybe it just collapsed on its own.
U.N. Member,We can't take that chance.
2nd U.N. Member,You always say that. I want to take a chance.
Hank Scorpio,Collapsed on its own -- You schm... You have 72 hours. See ya.
Hank Scorpio,"Back to the hammocks, my friend."
Homer Simpson,Yes.
,
Homer Simpson,Oh.
Hank Scorpio,"You know who invented the hammock, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,No?
Hank Scorpio,That's something for you to do. Find that out.
Homer Simpson,Any sugar around here?
Jumpsuited Guy,"Try in there, Homer."
Bart Simpson,
Selma Bouvier,Patty!
Hank Scorpio,"Hi, Homer! I'm keeping two of my fingers crossed that you're gonna have that nuclear generator up to full power by tomorrow."
Homer Simpson,Uh... yessir. No problemo.
Hank Scorpio,"Good. By the way, Homer, what's your least favorite country, Italy or France?"
Homer Simpson,France.
Hank Scorpio,Nobody ever says Italy.
Homer Simpson,I've never noticed this office before.
Hank Scorpio,Why should you? -- It's mine.
Homer Simpson,"Eh, you have any sugar around here?"
Hank Scorpio,Sugar? Sure.
Hank Scorpio,Here you go. Sorry it's not in packages. Want some cream?
Homer Simpson,Eh... I... no.

Hank Scorpio,"Ingenious, isn't it, Mr. Bont?"
Bont,"Scorpio, you are totally mad."
Hank Scorpio,"Huh, I wouldn't point fingers, you jerk."
Bont,"So, do you expect me to talk?"
Hank Scorpio,"I don't expect anything from you, except to die and be a very cheap funeral."
Hank Scorpio,You're gonna die now.
Hank Scorpio,Stop him! He's supposed to die!
Homer Simpson,Aargh!
Hank Scorpio,"Nice work, Homer. Am I prouda you!"
Homer Simpson,Well...
Hank Scorpio,"When you go home tonight, there's gonna be another story on your house. Thank you."

Homer Simpson,I tackled a loafer at work today.
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"I'm allergic to everything here. My nose is so stuffed up, I can't even taste Mom's delicious boiled celery."
Marge Simpson,"I've been so bored since we moved here, I've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. I know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but I just can't drink that much."
Homer Simpson,"Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You haven't even gotten in trouble at school."
Bart Simpson,I can't get in trouble at school. They put me in the remedial class! I'm surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round!
Bart Simpson,Hey Dad...
Bart Simpson,We want to go back to Springfield.
Homer Simpson,"What?! We've got it great here. And for the first time in my life, I'm actually good at my job. My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions."
Marge Simpson,"It's up to you, Homer. Whatever you decide, that's what we'll do."

Computer,T minus 1 minute 35 seconds.
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I've got a problem, Hank."
Hank Scorpio,"Aw, gee, Homer, could it wait a sec, please?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's pretty important."
Homer Simpson,"Say, what's going on?"
Hank Scorpio,I'm having a little trouble with the government.
Homer Simpson,"Aw, those jerks. Always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government."
Hank Scorpio,What's the problem?
Homer Simpson,"Well, my family wants to move back to Springfield."
Hank Scorpio,"Let 'em go. You'll stay here with me, we'll go bowling."
Hank Scorpio,What's bothering them?
Homer Simpson,Nothing big. It's just a lot of little things.
Hank Scorpio,"Well, you can't argue with the little things. It's the little things that make up life."
Hank Scorpio,"Homer, I'm disappointed, but I think you need to do what's best for your family."
Homer Simpson,"Well... Thanks for everything, Hank."
Computer,T minus 14 seconds.
Hank Scorpio,"If you need anything, you call me."
Hank Scorpio,"I've never had to call my own company. Someone will tell you upstairs. But Homer, on your way out, if you want to kill somebody, it would help me a lot."
Hank Scorpio,"Hey Homer, you're missing out on some fun!"

Homer Simpson,"""Project Arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. This will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. It's not the Dallas Cowboys, but it's a start. Drop me a line if you're on the East Coast, Hank Scorpio."""
Homer Simpson,"Aw, the Denver Broncos."
Marge Simpson,I think owning the Denver Broncos is pretty good.
Homer Simpson,Yeah yeah.
Marge Simpson,Well explain to me why it isn't.
Homer Simpson,"You just don't understand football, Marge."

Mall Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Springfield Mall in conjunction with Nostalgia Licensing Corp. is proud to present... the stars of ""Bonanza!"""
Indian #1,Thank you! I just wish Ben and Hoss and Little Joe and Hop-Sing and Sheriff Roy and all your favorites could be alive today to see this wonderful turn-out.
Indian #2,"You know, on the series, we were always trying to kill the Cartwrights..."

Indian #2,"...but it looks like Father Time took care of that for us, right? Am I right, folks?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, this sucks!"
Marge Simpson,Weren't there three Indians last year?
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge! They opened a new high-tech gadget store! You love high-tech gadgets!"

Homer Simpson,The World's Best Jacket! If I had this it would show everybody... show everybody!
Comic Book Guy,"Yes, finally, I would like to return your quote-unquote ""Ultimate Belt."""
Wiseguy,"I see. Do you have a receipt, quote-unquote ""sir""?"
Comic Book Guy,"No, I do not have a receipt. I won it as a door prize at the Star Trek Convention. Although I find their choice of prize highly illogical, as the average Trekker has no use for a medium-size belt."
Wiseguy,"Whoa! Whoa! A fat, sarcastic Star Trek fan! You must be a devil with the ladies."
Comic Book Guy,Hey I... Oh...
Wiseguy,"Gee, I hate to let you down, Casanova, but uh, no receipt, no return."
Bart Simpson,I'll give you four bucks for it!
Comic Book Guy,"Very well. I must hurry back to my comic book store, where I dispense the insults rather than absorb them."
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow! I bet if God wore pants, he'd have a belt like that!"
Bart Simpson,"This isn't a belt, it's a Tactical Pants-Retaining System. Check it out: compass, matches, whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare, radon-slash-lie detector, sphygmomanometer... and it's even got turn signals!"
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, Simpson, wanna trade belts?"
Bart Simpson,"Well, not really... 'cause yours is just a piece of extension cord..."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Hey, dude, he's raggin' on your cord!"
Jimbo Jones,Get him.
JANEY,No running!
Bart Simpson,Time for a little evasive action...
Jimbo Jones,"Hey, he's turnin' left!"
Microchip Voice,Help. Help. Help.
Bart Simpson,"I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but you guys asked for it..."
Bart Simpson,Can't you read? Call the police!
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what happened to your belt?"
Bart Simpson,Some bullies beat me up and took it.
Homer Simpson,"Son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. You've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start."
Bart Simpson,But then they'll just beat me up even worse.
Homer Simpson,"Yesss, they are a clever bunch. I know, I'll squeal for you. To their parents."
,
Jimbo's Dad,That's for tellin' me how to raise my lousy kid!
Dolph's Dad,This is for the crummy life I've had to live!
Homer Simpson,The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
Kearney's Dad,"Hey, somethin's wrong with this guy! He's not fallin' down!"
Moe Szyslak,"Fun's over, fellas. If you're gonna beat up my friend in my bar, there's a two-drink minimum."
Moe Szyslak,"Jeez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- I mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down."
Homer Simpson,Big deal. I didn't even get my kid's belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
Moe Szyslak,"There ya go! That's the spirit! Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you! Y'know, boxing might be right up your alley!"
Homer Simpson,Really?
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, please, it's the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!"
Homer Simpson,Dressing?
Moe Szyslak,Their choice.
Homer Simpson,You really think I could do it?
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I dunno, are you man enough to test every one of your limits?"
Homer Simpson,Yes!
Moe Szyslak,"And are you man enough to throw a punch, should the opportunity arise?"
Homer Simpson,Yes!
Moe Szyslak,And are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?
Homer Simpson,YES!!
Moe Szyslak,I'll take it!!
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
Moe Szyslak,"Now, Homer, if I'm gonna manage your boxing career, I wantcha to have complete faith in me. C'mere, lemme show ya somethin'..."
Homer Simpson,Wow! I've never been in here before!
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979, I turned it into an office."
Homer Simpson,You used to be a boxer just like me?
Moe Szyslak,"Yep. They called me ""Kid Gorgeous."" Later on, it was ""Kid Presentable."" Then ""Kid Gruesome."" And finally, ""Kid Moe."""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this?"
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. Yeah, I been meanin' to empty that out."
Homer Simpson,"You know Lucius Sweet? He's one of the biggest names in boxing! He's exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he looks just like him, too."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time."
Homer Simpson,Why not?
Moe Szyslak,"'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row. That, plus politics. You know, it's all politics..."
Homer Simpson,Lousy Democrats.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. You're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor."
Homer Simpson,No problemo.
Marge Simpson,A competent doctor!
Homer Simpson,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, sir, you more than meet every one of this state's requirements to box, wrestle, or be shot out of a cannon."
Marge Simpson,That's what we get for living in a state founded by circus freaks.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"You have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as ""Homer Simpson's Syndrome."""
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why me?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Don't worry, it's quite beneficial. Your brain is cushioned by a layer of fluid one eighth of an inch thicker than normal. It's almost as if you're wearing a football helmet inside your own head."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Why, I could wallop you all day with this surgical two-by-four without ever knocking you down. But I have other appointments."
,
Moe Szyslak,"All right, Homer, let's see the left."
Moe Szyslak,Oooo-kay... Let's see the right.
Homer Simpson,Just a second.
Moe Szyslak,When you're ready...
Homer Simpson,All right... Ready... Wait a minute... All right... Wait a minute... Just a sec...
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching."
Homer Simpson,Then I can just push him over.
Moe Szyslak,"That's right. And if the ref's not looking, you can kick him a coupla times."
,
Moe Szyslak,Who's gonna knock you down?
Homer Simpson,No one.
Moe Szyslak,When are you gonna fight back?
Homer Simpson,Never.
Moe Szyslak,What are you gonna do?
Homer Simpson,Nothing.
Moe Szyslak,That's my boy.
,
Barney Gumble,"Man, you'd never get me into a ring. Boxing causes brain damage!"
Moe Szyslak,Okay. You're fighting a guy named Boxcar Bob.
Homer Simpson,"Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, no. Not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he's a hungry young fighter. In fact, he's actually fighting for a sandwich."
Moe Szyslak,"Homer, I want you to have my lucky mitts. I hope you do better with 'em than I did."
Homer Simpson,"Gee, thanks, Moe... What's this?"
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, that's the barbed wire. Heh. We, uh, we called that ""The Stinger."" They... they don't let you use that no more."
Moe Szyslak,"Now, no matter how much he hits you, you don't do nothin', okay? You don't wanna get drawn into a boxing match here."
Bart Simpson,"Way to go, Dad! Take those punches!"
Lenny Leonard,"Man, that tramp's got the energy of a hobo!"
Drederick Tatum,"Hey, guys, c'mon, shut up!"
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, he never stops punching... 'cept to check on his bindle."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, Homer, he's tired! He's tired! Now's your chance! Nudge him! Nudge him!"

LUCIUS,"Hello, Moe. Delightful to see you again."
Moe Szyslak,"Lucius! Hey, what's a glitterati like you doin' in my dump? I--I thought you were managing the Champ."
LUCIUS,"Yes, managing Drederick has been my highest priority, even though he is temporarily incarcerated for pushing his mother down the stairs. But with his impending release, I've been strategizing for his glorious return to the shores of fistiana."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, what?"
LUCIUS,"His comeback fight. You know, boxing."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, oh, man. Yeah, well, who's donatin' his body for that one? Huh?"
LUCIUS,"Well, word is you manage a stalwart young pugilist who cannot be knocked down."
Moe Szyslak,Homer? You want Homer to fight Tatum?
LUCIUS,"Well, the fans are weary of fights that are over before they have an opportunity to even get drunk. I just need a body who can sustain verticality for three rounds."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. But Homer's no boxer, he-- he's just a freak. Tatum'll fustigate him!"
LUCIUS,"Well, fustigation aside, Moe, you've got a choice: you can either sit here in the ladies room with your faded memories, or you can take your last shot at the big time. And I can make it happen."
LUCIUS,"Three rounds, that's all I ask."
Moe Szyslak,"I gotta be honest with ya, Homer. I didn't bring you up here to show you my new tar-paper."
Homer Simpson,You... didn't?
Moe Szyslak,"No. Homer, how would you like to be Heavyweight Champion of the World?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, sure."
Moe Szyslak,Great. All you gotta do is fight Drederick Tatum. It's this Saturday. Here's your parking pass.
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, ""General!"" Who's Drederick Tatum, anyway? Is he another hobo?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, you know what? I'm gonna have to check on that..."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance."
Prisoners,"We'll keep it down. / Sorry, Champ. / It was Jerry. / We didn't know you were here. / Sorry."
,
Questioner #1,Champ! Champ! Do you feel remorse for your crime?
Drederick Tatum,"Oh, yes, believe me, my God, if I could turn back the clock on my mother's stair pushing, I would certainly reconsider it."
Questioner #2,"Drederick, uh, what do you think of Homer Simpson?"
Drederick Tatum,"I think he's a good man, I like him, I got nothing against him. But I'm definitely gonna make orphans of his children."
Questioner #3,"Uh, y'know, they do have a mother, Champ..."
Drederick Tatum,"Yes, but I would imagine that she would die of grief."
LUCIUS,"Thank you, thank you, but the Champ has no time for further queries. This parole hearing is over."
PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS,
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, well... I was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!"
Marge Simpson,Have you lost your mind?!
Homer Simpson,"Aw, c'mon, I'll make a fortune for one night's work! We could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --"
Marge Simpson,But you'll get killed!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, will you let me finish? ...Plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --"
Lisa Simpson,"Mom's right, Dad. The odds against you winning are a thousand to one."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I don't think it's that unlikely."
Lisa Simpson,Those are the odds they're giving in Vegas.
Homer Simpson,"All right, I think we've heard just about enough from Mr. Newspaper today."
Announcer,"Society put Drederick Tatum away for his brutal crime. But he's paid his debt, and now he's going to get revenge... on Homer Simpson."
Grampa Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,That's your dad-dy!
,
T-shirt Vendor,Get yer T-shirts! Tell 'em where you've been by wearing a T-shirt!
Bart Simpson,"You'll be okay, Dad. Just make sure he hits you an even number of times so you don't end up with amnesia."
Marge Simpson,"Moe, I'm so glad I found you. Please promise me you won't let Homer get hurt."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey! I'm not the villain here, okay? If Homer gets killed in the ring tonight, it'll be because of your negative attitude! There, I said it."
Marge Simpson,"Listen to me. The instant that Homer's in any kind of danger, I want you to throw in this towel and stop the fight."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, all right, all right! I promise! Okay?"
Marge Simpson,Thank you.
,
Kent Brockman,This just in: go to hell!
Michael Buffer,"From the world of organized crime, say hello to Anthony ""Fat Tony"" D'Amico."
Michael Buffer,"... and the ruiner of events worldwide: title fights, the Super Bowl, and the Nixon Funeral, ladies and gentlemen -- The Fan Man."
Krusty the Clown,"Aw, cripes. Now I gotta comb this side over."
Moe Szyslak,"All right, Homer, I'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat Tatum. But you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?"
Homer Simpson,Gotcha.
Sportscaster,"A congenital heart defect has apparently felled Tatum, moments before he could step into the ring."
Michael Buffer,"And now, please welcome back into decent society... Ladies and gentlemen, The Heavyweight Champion of the World, Drederick Tatum!"
Crowd,
Michael Buffer,"And to challenge the irresistible force of Tatum, we have ""The Immovable Object!"" He's been called ""The Brick Hithouse"" and is also known as ""The Southern Dandy"" -- Ho-mer Simp-son!"
LUCIUS,"Your boy looks a little soft, Moe. You do remember our arrangement?"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, don't worry. You'll get your three rounds!"
LUCIUS,"Stupendous. Because if he goes down before that bell rings, your future's going with him."
Moe Szyslak,"Okey-doke, future down the crapper. Gotcha."
Michael Buffer,"Due to popular demand, we will forgo our national anthem. And now, Ladies and gentlemen, LET'S GET READY TO RUM-BLE!!!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about... just--"
Crowd,
Bart Simpson,Wow! I've never seen Dad hit somebody like that before!
Lisa Simpson,What are you talking about?
Bart Simpson,Isn't Dad the one in the black trunks?
Lisa Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
Marge Simpson,What? What?! What am I missing? What?
Michael Buffer,... And there's Tatum showboating for the crowd...
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, jeez, only six seconds in... Attaboy, Homer! Keep dancin'!"
Michael Buffer,"Showing utter disdain for his opponent's abilities, Tatum is taking a short mid-round breather to converse with actor Charlie Sheen."
Drederick Tatum,You know what's great there is the sea bass. They do it blackened or sautÃ©ed. It's stupendous.
Referee,"Okay, break it up. Break it up, you two."
Marge Simpson,"Homer! Homer, he's not going to get tired! You've got to hit him back! Hit him back!"
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Hang in there, Homer! Only 440 more seconds! He's getting his second wind."
Grampa Simpson,"No, he's getting killed! He's gonna die on his feet!"
Moe Szyslak,I can't watch this. I gotta get out of here!
Marge Simpson,Somebody stop the fight! Where's the doctor?!
Dr. Nick Riviera,Kill him! Kill him!
Michael Buffer,It looks like it's all over. Tatum wants to finish this with one punch. And here it comes...
Michael Buffer,"Oh, my God! Simpson's manager has flown into the ring and is airlifting him out! Ladies and gentlemen, whatever dignity remained in boxing is literally flying out the window!"
Homer Simpson,Are you an angel?
Moe Szyslak,"Yes, Homer, I'm an angel. All us angels wear Farah slacks."
Homer Simpson,But you stopped the fight. Won't everyone be mad at you?
Homer Simpson,"Aaar, matey."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, let 'em be mad. The only thing that matters to me is, you're safe."
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,Sorry.
Drederick Tatum,"Homer, your manager obviously loves you very much. Lucius, would you do that for me?"
LUCIUS,Absolutely I would. Now get in the van.
LUCIUS,"You couldn't even give me one lousy round, Moe! You will always be a loser! Now take your check for a hundred thousand dollars and get out of my sight."
Moe Szyslak,I don't need your stinkin' money!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, are you okay?"
Homer Simpson,I can't remember where we parked.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's all right. We'll just wait until everyone else leaves."
Bart Simpson,"I got your tooth, Dad!"
Homer Simpson,"Eh, not mine."
Marge Simpson,"Thank you, Moe. I know you gave up your dreams for Homer."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, what do dreams matter, Marge? I was able to stick up for a pal."
Moe Szyslak,"Well, so long, Springfield..."
Homer Simpson,Where are you going?
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, nowheres in particular. I just need some time to think."
Fan Man,"Hey, there you are... Gimme that contraption back... You said you were only takin' it for five minutes..."
,
Lisa Simpson,What a perfect outing for a beautiful autumn day!
Marge Simpson,I feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the World Series!
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today."
Park Ranger,"...And the cider mill operated continuously until 1941, when its workers left to fight in the Second World War. When they returned, the old girl was just as they'd left her -- only now, she was infested with thousands upon thousands of rats."
Tour Group,
Park Ranger,"Right. And if you listen real carefully, you can still hear them gnawing away at the apples and splashing around in the toilets. And that concludes this portion of the tour."
Conductor,"Attention, passengers. The train has been temporarily delayed because of a discarded couch on the tracks."
Park Ranger,"...one of the most historically significant fruit presses in this part of the state. Based on a German design, but modified for the larger American apples..."
Ned Flanders,"Well, if God didn't make little green apples -- it's Homer Simpson! How long have you been here?"
Homer Simpson,Twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, suckin' down the cider, eh? Hey, word to the wise... season pass!"
Ned Flanders,"Pays for itself after the 16th visit. You know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. But I do. Now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
Ned Flanders,"If it's clear and yellow, you've got juice there, fellow! If it's tangy and brown, you're in Cider Town! Now there's two exceptions, and it gets kinda tricky here..."
Ned Flanders,"...Adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. And, of course, in Canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my. I better get you some cider."
Marge Simpson,"Next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season. Just look at all this beautiful foilage."
Lisa Simpson,"It's not foilage, Mom. It's foliage. Fo-li-age."
Marge Simpson,"That's what I said, foilage . It doesn't take a nucular scientist to pronounce foilage."

C. Montgomery Burns,"Honestly, Smithers, I don't know why Harvard even bothers to show up. Heh. They barely even won."
Waylon Smithers,"Their cheating was even more rampant than last year, sir."

C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I say let Harvard have its football and academics. Yale will always be first in gentlemanly club-life. Why, every friend I have I made right here."
Old Preppie,"Hallo, Burnsie! It's your old roomie, Dink!"
C. Montgomery Burns,

C. Montgomery Burns,Steady... steady...
Waylon Smithers,"Oh-ho, nicely played, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"This may take a while, Smithers. Why don't you get drunk and stumble around comically for my amusement?"
Waylon Smithers,I'll be a one-man conga line.
Larry,"Hey, customers! Thank God! Papa needs a new pair of everything!"
Larry,"Hey, how ya doin'? Welcome to scenic Waynesport. And remember your visit with a googly-eyed walnut."
Larry,"How 'bout a googly-eyed rock? Some nice local squash candy? A stretched-out Pepsi bottle? Come on! If this stuff is too nice for ya, I've got some crap!"
Waylon Smithers,"Da, da, da ... Whoa-- Ow-- Where'd that lamp come from?... Whoa..."
Larry,"Hey, Casey Jones, where's this train headed?"
Conductor,Springfield.
Larry,"Yeah, yeah, what state?"
,
Marge Simpson,"I can honestly say that was the most fun I've ever had. The mill, the history, all that gorgeous foliage."
Marge Simpson,"I can't excape Lisa, our little walking libary!"
Homer Simpson,Can't they get a pole for that sign?
Bart Simpson,"That's a hitchhiker, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, let's pick him up!"
Marge Simpson,No! What if he's crazy?
Homer Simpson,And what if he's not? Then we'd look like idiots.
Marge Simpson,We're not picking him up!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes we are!"
Marge Simpson,There's not enough room!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes, there is!"
Marge Simpson,I just don't think it's a good idea.
Homer Simpson,"And I think it's the best idea I've ever had! We're picking up the weirdo, and that's final."
,
Larry,"Hey, you folks are all right. Man, it was rough gettin' a ride out there. The only car that stopped was a hearse that thought I fell out. It was rough, I tell ya."
Marge Simpson,Careful of the apple pie on the seat.
Grampa Simpson,Uh-ohhh.
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, are you sitting on the pie?"
Grampa Simpson,I sure hope so.
,
Larry,"Hey, I'm looking for this guy. Anybody know who he is?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, sure, we know him. That's Mr. Burns."
Lisa Simpson,He tried to kill our puppies.
Marge Simpson,He sexually harassed me.
Grampa Simpson,He stole my fiancÃ©e.
Homer Simpson,He made fun of my weight.
Larry,"Okay, so there's been a little friction. Know his address?"
,
Larry,"Whoa, this guy's got more bread than a prison meatloaf. He's rich, I tell ya. I never seen a place with a walk-in mailbox. Hey, who am I talkin' to?"
Waylon Smithers,Yes?
Larry,"Yeah, uh, hi, my name is Larry. I'm here to see Mr. Burns."
Waylon Smithers,"Well, I hate to break it to you, ""Larry,"" but if Mr. Burns ever wants to see a stranger, he will observe him through a powerful telescope. Now if you'll --"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, what's going on? How dare you interrupt my lime rickey? State your business."
Larry,"Well, uh... sheesh, I-- I'm a little nervous here... What I'm trying to say is, I'm..."
C. Montgomery Burns,You're what? Selling light bulbs? Worried about the whales? Keen on Jesus? Out with it!
Larry,"Oh, Mr. Burns... I'm your son."
Larry,"Oh, and I stepped on one of your peacocks. You got a paper towel?"
C. Montgomery Burns,It's true. He is my son.
Larry,"Hey, now you're talking!"
Waylon Smithers,Good God!
Larry,"Ah, Pop, don't get me wrong, it's great to be here, but how's a guy like you wind up with a son like me?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Larry, my lad, I've gone over this story in my mind a million times. It was 1941 -- the -- no, '39 -- my 25th Yale reunion..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Who should appear but the unrequited love of my college years, Mimsy Bancroft...Of course, by then Mimsy had her share of wrinkles and a gray hair or two, but my adoring eyes saw past those minor imperfections to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily."
C. Montgomery Burns,I took Lily to the local cinematorium...
,
Marge Simpson,"Yay, Mom! All right, Mom!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"...where our passions were inflamed by Clark Gable's reckless use of the word ""damn."""
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"We sneaked into the nearby Peabody Museum. There under the smiling eyes of four stuffed Eskimos, we expressed our love physically, as was the style at the time."
Larry,"Well, how do you like that? I have been in a museum! So what happened with you and Ma?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, there was a terrible scandal. Lily's family forced her to give you up and bundled her off to a convent in the South Seas. I never heard from her again. But I prattle on -- tell me everything about your life."
Larry,"Oh, what's to tell? I was at the orphanage till I was 18, then I got my job at the souvenir stand. Oh, and once I saw a blimp."
C. Montgomery Burns,Well. You must be tired. Let me show you your room.
,
Larry,"Well, is this posh! Aw, Pop, nobody's ever been so nice to me!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes... All right... Uh-huh... It's good to see you, too... Now then, in case you get bored, here's the playroom."
Willy Loman,You can't just eat the orange and throw the peel away -- a man's not a piece of fruit!
C. Montgomery Burns,"This show was supposed to close last week! Close this show! Close it, I say!"
Larry,"Hey, don't worry about it. You're all right."
,
Homer Simpson,
Larry,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you're that hitchhiker! What are you doing here?"
Larry,"Learnin' the family business. I'm Larry Burns, the boss's son."
Homer Simpson,
Larry,"Hey, relax. I don't wanna work. I'm so lazy, I took lessons on the player piano."
Homer Simpson,"Wow, that's really lazy."
Larry,"Lazy? You're not kidding. I'm like a rug on Valium, I'm talkin' lazy."
Homer Simpson,So lazy.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. Well, I... Oh, you know, I just remembered it's time for my annual donation. I wonder how much I should give..."
Homer Simpson,"...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry!"
Marge Simpson,I think we heard enough about Larry Burns for one evening.
Homer Simpson,Why? It's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
Maggie Simpson,
,
Larry,"Hey, Pop, this crowd is pretty swanky. I'm not gonna fit in here."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense, Larry, your blood is bluer than any of theirs! Just give them a snootful of the old Burns charm!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, Admiral Carstairs, I'd like you to meet my son, Larry."
Larry,"Hey, Skipper, good to meet you. Where'd you start out, on the Merrimac? Hey, I should talk, I hope I look that good when I'm 200."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Larry, please, he's very sensitive about his age."
Wealthy Dowager,"Oh, Monty, this must be the son I've heard so much about! Larry, you must meet our daughter, the debutante. She came out last spring."
Larry,"Whoa! Put her back in, she's not done yet!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, there's something a bit odd about young Larry. I can't quite put my finger on it."
Waylon Smithers,"Well, he is a bit rough around the edges, sir. One might blame his truly heroic intake of cocktails."
Larry,"Pull up a seat, Pop! You too, Chuckles! I mean, the food ain't great, but the portions are terrific."
Larry,"Hey, I'm kidding, relax. Hey, give my regards to Mrs. Boy-ar-dee."
C. Montgomery Burns,"A total lack of refinement. Smithers, send for the boys at Yale Admissions, huh?"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, did you meet Larry?"
Male Admissions Officer,"Oh, yes. He made light of my weight problem, then suggested my motto should be ""Semper Fudge."" At that point, he told me to ""relax."""
C. Montgomery Burns,How were his test scores?
Female Admissions Officer,"Let's just say this. He spelled ""Yale"" with a six."
Male Admissions Officer,"Well, frankly, test scores like Larry's would call for a very generous contribution..."
Male Admissions Officer,"For example, a score of 400 would require a donation of new football uniforms... 300: a new dormitory. And in Larry's case, we would need an international airport."
Female Admissions Officer,"Yale could use an international airport, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,Are you mad? I'm not made of airports! Get out!
C. Montgomery Burns,Summon my son at once!
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, it appears he's ""gone drinkin',"" sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Larry,"Everybody go nuts, I'm buyin'! Hey, Handsome, send the bill to my dad."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in a landfill."
Barney Gumble,Yeah. But it was worth it!
Larry,"What's everybody in this burg have against my Dad? He's a pussycat. I tell ya, he's a doll-baby. Come on over, I'll show ya!"
,
Larry,"Oh, this is some party. If it gets any livelier, a funeral's gonna break out."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Quiet, you! Nobody likes a comedian!"
Larry,"Geez, come on, Dad, we got company. Make with the yakkety-yak-yak."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, ""yakkety-yak-yak""... You, Foodbag -- do you have a son?"
Homer Simpson,"Yes, sir. I do."
C. Montgomery Burns,And is he a constant disappointment? Does he bring home nitwits and make you talk to them?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Fascinating. Goodnight.
Larry,"Dad, what's with you tonight? I mean, I'm gettin' frostbite over here..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'll tell you what's with me -- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish, ignoramus for a son!"
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I should go."
Larry,"What's the matter, Pop? Don't you love me anymore?"
Larry,"Sheesh, Dad and I, we started out great, but now it's fallin' apart, like a Chinese motorcycle."
Homer Simpson,It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.
Larry,"Yeah. I tell ya, I don't get no regard, no regard at all. No esteem, either."
Homer Simpson,"Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. And that... is a phony kidnapping."
Larry,"Yeah, right. I dunno, maybe I should just leave town."
Homer Simpson,Pho-ny kid-napping...
Larry,"Nah, I know what I gotta do..."
Larry,"I gotta clean up my act: no more jokin' around all the time, no more slackin' off at work, and most important, no more booze. I know I can do it."
C. Montgomery Burns,Your son has been kidnapped...
C. Montgomery Burns,I can't believe someone would kidnap my Larry. I won't rest until he's returned to me!
Waylon Smithers,"Not to be impertinent, sir, but didn't you want Larry out of your life as recently as two hours ago?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"It's the principle, Smithers! Nobody steals from Montgomery Burns, whether it be my Sunday newspaper or my loutish oaf of a son."
Chief Wiggum,"All right, Mr. B, when the kidnappers call with the ransom demand, you tell them you'll leave the money under the big net in the park."
Lou,"And then down comes the net! Right, Chief?"
Chief Wiggum,"Heyyyy, I like it! I like it a lot!"
,
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,What are you doing in the basement? It's like you're hiding out down here.
Homer Simpson,"Hiding out? Marge, you've been reading too many hideout books."
Marge Simpson,And what's that hitchhiker doing here? Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
Homer Simpson,Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
Lisa Simpson,"He's not a drifter, Mom. That's Mr. Burns's son, Larry."
Bart Simpson,He's great at pointing out everyone's foibles!
Larry,"Hey, how ya doin'? Whoo, look at your hair. What happened? -- You saw yourself in the mirror?"
Bart Simpson,"He's kidding, Mom. But seriously, I'd love to have hair like yours -- I just can't get the zoning permits."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, that reminds me, Mom -- Buckingham Palace called. They want their hat back."
Larry,"Hey, kids, how 'bout a hand for your Mom? She's all right!"
Bart Simpson,More food.
Marge Simpson,Oh. Yeah. Thank you.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahoy-hoy?
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes! I'm missing one son! Return it immediately!
Homer Simpson,"If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, how much proof do you need? Five thousand? Six thousand? I swear, that's all I've got."
Homer Simpson,Don't you care about your son? This is more important than money!
C. Montgomery Burns,More important than money? Who is this?
Homer Simpson,Just a second.
Chief Wiggum,"Beautiful. Eddie, did you trace the phone number?"
Eddie,"Sure did, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,"""5-5-5..."" Aw, geez, that's gotta be phony!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, I think I got a Pai Gow!"
Bart Simpson,I hate Pai Gow. Can't we just play Quang Jong?
Marge Simpson,Can't we just go upstairs?
Homer Simpson,No!
Kent Brockman,This is Kent Brockman in ChopperCopter 6 with a special report. Montgomery Burns's son has been kidnapped.
Marge Simpson,Kidnapped?!
Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not a real kidnapping. It's a simple hoax to win a father's love."
Marge Simpson,You know how I feel about hoaxes!
Homer Simpson,Still?
Marge Simpson,"I want you to take Larry back to Mr. Burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble."
Homer Simpson,"What... But... Marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!"
Marge Simpson,No excuses! Just do it!
Homer Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"Of course we'll bring you updates as soon as they... Oh, wait a minute! There they are! Larry Burns and his kidnapper!"
Homer Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"Appearing in broad daylight, with police everywhere... Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one word for that: idiocy!"
Marge Simpson,
,
Larry,We gotta find someplace to hide!
Homer Simpson,The abandoned warehouse!

Homer Simpson,Stupid economic recovery!

Costume Shop Clerk,"Hey, buy a costume or get out, Fellas!"

Homer Simpson,We've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. Hel-lo!

Child's Voice,"Drive faster, Grandma! Grandma's gaining on us!"
Homer Simpson,"Heh-heh, they'll never look for us here."
Larry,"Yeah, this place is emptier than a Scottish pay toilet."
Hans Moleman,Shhhhh!
Hans Moleman,Some people are trying to watch the movie!
Homer Simpson,"You don't like it, call the cops!"
Larry,
Kent Brockman,"This is Kent Brockman, live from the Aztec Theater, where police have learned that kidnapper Homer Simpson and hostage Larry Burns are inside, talking loudly..."
,
Marge Simpson,"Ohhh! Give yourself up, Homie!"
Bart Simpson,"No, Dad! Shoot your way out!"
Lisa Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"A bloody end for Homer Simpson...is just one of several possible outcomes, according to our computer simulation. Now, here's how it would look if the police killed him with a barrage of baseballs..."
Lisa Simpson,We've got to go down there and help Dad!
Simulated Homer,"Ouch! Oooch! Eeech! Ouch! Ooch! Oh, stop it!!"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Hmm, still warm. They can't be far."
Lou,Chief!
Chief Wiggum,"Don't be a fool, Simpson! Let the kid go!"
C. Montgomery Burns,The negotiations have failed! Shoot him!
Larry,Wait!
Crowd,Wait! Wait...
Larry,"I mean, Homer's no kidnapper. He's the best friend I ever had! We faked the whole thing."
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"It'll be okay, honey. There's lots more oil where that came from."
,
Waylon Smithers,"With pleasure, sir."
Homer Simpson,"Hold on, Mr. Burns. Maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? All your son wanted was a little attention, a little love."
Homer Simpson,"I'm a father myself, sir. And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --"
Homer Simpson,-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.
Larry,"How 'bout it, Pop? I know it's tough, but can ya love me for what I am?"

C. Montgomery Burns,"There, there, sonny-boy. I suppose I have been a bit... Oh, no, I can't do it. It's just not me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm sorry, Larry, I can't be the family that you need."
Larry,"Aw, that's okay, I got a wife and kids. Ooh, that reminds me. They're probably wonderin' where I went. I told them I was going for coffee. That was a week ago."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, son, delighted to have met you. It's good to know that there's another kidney out there for me."
Larry,"You got it, Pop. Just let me run a few pints through it first!"
Larry,As long as everybody's here... LET'S PARTY!!
Crowd,
Lisa Simpson,Who's playing that music?
Marge Simpson,And where is all that liquor coming from?
Homer Simpson,"It's a party, Marge. It doesn't have to make sense."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Da-ad! V-chip, V-chip!"
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, sorry. My fault."
Lisa Simpson,

Announcer,We interrupt this cartoon for a Special Report.
Homer Simpson,Someone found my keys!
Kent Brockman,"Kent Brockman at the Action News desk. A massive tanker has run aground on the central coastline, spilling millions of gallons of oil on Baby Seal Beach."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no!"
Kent Brockman,Preliminary reports indicated the ship's captain was drunk at the helm. Those reports were later confirmed.
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arrr. I'm in a lot of trouble now. Hey, I'll give ya a hundred bucks to take the blame."
Kent Brockman,"A clean-up effort is already underway. And as always, the first to pitch in are those unsung heroes, Hollywood movie stars."
Rainier Wolfcastle,This isn't about publicity. This is about cleaning off gunk.
Starlet,"As a Golden Globe nominee, I just think it's our duty to make the real globe a little more golden."
Lisa Simpson,"...And we'd be doing our part for the environment! Plus, we'd get to clean up all those cute animals."
Marge Simpson,"Honey, we don't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals. You can stay right here and give the dog a bath. Or trim the cat's nails."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Mom, please! You can make this my birthday and Christmas presents!"
Marge Simpson,You've already used up your birthday and Christmas presents on that peach tree we got you. And you hardly ever play with that anymore.
Lisa Simpson,Yes I do! Sure I do! Look!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, all right, we'll go."
Marge Simpson,"Now, the cat needs his medication every morning --"
Homer Simpson,No problem... Can do.
Marge Simpson,"And the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--"
Homer Simpson,Right... Uh huh... Gotcha... Cat in the furnace.
Marge Simpson,"Uh, you know, I think I'll take Maggie with us."
Marge Simpson,"And if anything happens, just use your best judgm... Just do what I would do."
Bart Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.
Bart Simpson,What time?
Homer Simpson,"You know, I don't know."
Bart Simpson,Shall we say ten?
Homer Simpson,All right. Just wake me up.
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Sports Announcer,"Live! From the Grand Ballroom of the Hapsburg Imperial Palace, it's the World Series of Bumper Cars!"
Bart Simpson,"Dad, do I have to brush my teeth?"
Homer Simpson,"No, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda."
Bart Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,I'm gonna rescue a baby seal! And then I'm gonna save an otter!
Official,"Oh, I'm sorry, but all the animals have already been reserved for celebrities."
Rainier Wolfcastle,There. That's 104 pounds of sandpipers.
Lisa Simpson,You mean there's nothing left to clean?
Official,"Well, there are rocks. Thousands and thousands of rocks."
Marge Simpson,I've got rocks that need washing at home.
,
Homer Simpson,"Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something."
Bart Simpson,Huh -- garbage angels?
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I think I need some fresh air. Can I go to the park?"
Homer Simpson,Do I have to sit up?
Bart Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Knock yourself out.
,
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, this is boring. Make it crash or something!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the scale-model pilot.
Nelson Muntz,Gimme that!
Milhouse Van Houten,Hey!!
Martin Prince,It's gaining on us!
Ralph Wiggum,I'm pedaling backwards!
Martin Prince,Abandon ship!
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't like being outdoors, Smithers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"For one thing, there are too many fat children."
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Thanks a lot! Now it's stuck on that haunted house!
Nelson Muntz,I heard a witch lives there.
Ralph Wiggum,I heard a Frankenstein lives there.
Milhouse Van Houten,You guys are way off. It's a secret lab where they take the brains out of zombies and put them in the heads of other zombies to create a race of Super-Zombies!
Nelson Muntz,That's the house?!
Bart Simpson,"Stand aside, wussies."
Woman's Voice,Go away. No children.
Bart Simpson,Enough talk.
Bart Simpson,S-U-C-C-E-E-S / That's the way you spell succes--
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"No, no!... He... help!... I'm gonna die!..."
Bart Simpson,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, no! The witch has Bart!"
Martin Prince,We've got to hurry!
,
Homer Simpson,Just a minute!
Homer Simpson,Hello.
Woman,"Your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very valuable stone gargoyle, and... are you wearing a grocery bag?"
Homer Simpson,I have misplaced my pants.
Woman,"I'm not going to press charges, but I assume you'll want to punish him."
Homer Simpson,"'Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him."
Bart Simpson,"You're the man, Homer."
Woman,"Well, if you won't discipline him, I'll come back and speak with his mother."
Homer Simpson,"No! Wait! Wait! Madam, I run a house of discipline. The boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. Good day."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?"
Bart Simpson,She makes me taste beer.
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy. Give your old man a little credit."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, I still get to punish you."
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, you're gonna do chores for that lady until you work off the damage you did. It's called responsibility."
Homer Simpson,
Woman,"Come on in, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I can't believe I gotta spend all my free time dustin' doilies in a smelly, run-down dump for a creepy old witch..."
Bart Simpson,"Lady, I gotta tell ya -- I have been grossly misinformed about witches."
,
Bart Simpson,"Wow, man! What is this place?"
Woman,"I prefer not to be called ""man."" My name is Belle, and this is the Maison Derriere. That means the, uh, ""back house."""
Bart Simpson,Are you having a party or something?
Woman,"Non-stop. We're a burlesque house, a private club where gentlemen can play some cards and see a show..."
Dancer #1,"Miss Belle, we're about to do our Around the World number, but Monte Carlo can't find her dice."
Belle,"Here you go, darlin'."
Belle,"Normally, we don't allow children in here, but your father was so insistent..."
Bart Simpson,He's tough but fair. I'll start sorting these bras.
Belle,That's a bit advanced for you. But I know a stopped-up sink that needs some attention.
Bart Simpson,Just glad to be on the team!
,
Belle,"When you work the door, the main things are to greet the visitors and toss out the troublemakers."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, the ol' greet 'n' toss. No problemo."
Belle,How did I ever get along without you?
Grampa Simpson,Is your name Bart?
Grampa Simpson,What the ?! Does your father know you're working here?
Bart Simpson,It was his idea.
Grampa Simpson,"In that case, I'll have a whiskey sour."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks. And I think I know what it is..."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, I know it's frustrating. But we made a commitment and we have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant."
Official,"Quitting time! Okay. Scrub up and head for the communal tarp. We're having kelp-burgers and we're going to watch a tape of Johnny Arvik, he's the Eskimo comedian!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Faster, Mom, faster!"
,
Belle,"Oh, that was our emcee, Mel Zetz. He got out of bed too fast and broke his hip."
Bart Simpson,So who's gonna warm up the crowd tonight?
Belle,"Well, whoever fits Mel's tuxedo."
Bart Simpson,Eep.
,
Belle,"The jokes are in the breast pocket. If you get in trouble, there's a switch that makes the bow-tie spin."
Bart Simpson,"Heh. Nudist colonies are everywhere these days. I'd love to go, but I... I can't get the wrinkles out of my birthday suit!"
Audience,
Bart Simpson,"But I gotta tell ya, Adam and Eve must have been the first bookkeepers. They invented the loose leaf system."
Audience,
Bart Simpson,"If there's a bad bookkeeping joke, I haven't heard it."
,
TV Announcer,It's eleven o'clock. Do you know where your children are?
Homer Simpson,"I told you last night, no! Where is Bart, anyway? His dinner's getting all cold and eaten."
,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!"
Homer Simpson,"What the... ""President Eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... Not pictured: Mrs. Eisenhower."""
Belle,I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Bart was filling in for --
Homer Simpson,I don't care if he was filling in for Mel Zetz! He's my son and I don't want him --
Homer Simpson,working... so... late... that...
Belle,"Oh, I agree. Kids need rules and boundaries."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, everyone loves rules..."
Belle,"It's so tough to be a parent these days, what with all the gangs and the drugs..."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, he didn't pay the cover!"
Belle,"Oh, Bart, he's your father. We'll comp him tonight. Start a tab tomorrow."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, I hope I didn't miss the floor show..."
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Seymour Skinner,Is Roxanne back?
Bart Simpson,Yup.
Seymour Skinner,"Did she, uh, get my flowers?"
Bart Simpson,She did.
Seymour Skinner,"I... Hello, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Hello, Principal Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,"This is the National Air and Space Museum, isn't it?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, this isn't gonna be about Jesus, is it?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"All things are about Jesus, Homer... except this. Your son has been working in a burlesque house."
Helen Lovejoy,Principal Skinner saw him with his own eyes.
Seymour Skinner,"That's true, but I was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there."
Homer Simpson,"Helen, as a responsible parent, I was already well aware of that."
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's..."
,
Marge Simpson,"""Maison Derriere""?! I can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. Homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent Bart to work there?"
Homer Simpson,No! I only learned that four days ago.
Marge Simpson,"What were you thinking, sending Bart to such an awful place?"
Homer Simpson,"I was trying to punish him exactly like you would. So, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. This is your mess and I'll be damned if I'm gonna clean it up!"
,
Belle,"Please come in, Mrs. Simpson. How can I be of service?"
Marge Simpson,I have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from Springfield.
Belle,"Oh, honey, you can't be serious..."
Marge Simpson,Springfield doesn't want places like this!
Belle,"I think I know what Springfield wants, sugar."
Marge Simpson,Oh? I've lived in this town for 37 years.
Belle,I've lived here 52 years.
Marge Simpson,I'm third generation.
Belle,Sixth.
Marge Simpson,Get out of my town!
Seymour Skinner,Mother!
Belle,"Listen, darlin', we're just as much a part of Springfield as the church, the library, or the crazy house. So I think I'll stay right here... neighbor."
Marge Simpson,"Is that so? Well, sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial!"
Marge Simpson,You're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the English language are Marge Simpson!
Marge Simpson,It's the light pink '87 wagon.
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"...and after visiting the area for the past two months, I have determined it is not feasible to construct a Supertrain between Springfield and Aruba."
Townspeople,Awww...
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Next on the agenda is, uh... the Citizens' Committee On Moral Hygiene."
Townspeople,Awww...
Marge Simpson,"I'm here to share my moral outrage, but this time it's not about that giant, inflatable Dos Equis bottle. It's about a certain house in our town..."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, what's wrong with this house? Is it the plumbing?"
Marge Simpson,No. It's a House of Ill Fame... a House of Loose Ethics...
Kent Brockman,Is there a building code violation? A drainage issue? A surveying error?
Marge Simpson,The house is perfectly fine!
Chief Wiggum,"Well, then quit badmouthing the house!"
Otto Mann,"Yeah, leave the house alone!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, geez -- It's what's inside the house that's disgraceful -- drinking, gambling, and debauchery! It's right under our noses -- a secret house of burlesque!"
Townspeople,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"People, this is an issue that we, as a town, are strong enough to ignore. Let us give no more scrutiny to this bawdy house and its small clientele of loyal perverts."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, I'm afraid this problem goes far beyond Eugene and Rusty."
Rusty,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Marge, if you please..."
Bernice Hibbert,Julius!
Sarah Wiggum,Clancy!
Gary Chalmers,Skinner!
Agnes Skinner,Seymour!
Brandine Del Roy,Cletus!
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, uh, Barney..."
Sarah Wiggum,Clancy!
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, come on! You did me twice!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers?!
Waylon Smithers,"My... my parents insisted I give it a try, sir."
Luann Van Houten,Mayor Quimby!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Uh, well, uh, that could be any mayor."
Marge Simpson,I rest my case.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Er, uh, well, in light of these new facts, of which I now realize I was largely aware, I must take action. All in favor of demolishing our beloved burlesque house, raise your hands."
Jasper Beardly,Are they talking about the bordello?
Grampa Simpson,"No, the burlesque house. So just keep your mouth shut."
,
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, there's no justice like angry mob justice."
Lenny Leonard,I'm gonna burn all the historic memorabilias!
Moe Szyslak,I'm going to take me home a toilet!
Groundskeeper Willie,There'd a-better be two!
Belle,Who is it?
Ned Flanders,"Uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. Could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
Belle,Just a minute.
Helen Lovejoy,"Stand aside, you degenerate, two-bit proprietress!"
Belle,Don't you call me that! I am an entrepreneuse!
Sideshow Mel,"Oh, shut up! You're wasting valuable smashing time!"
Bart Simpson,"Dad, we can't let this happen to Belle! Do something!"
Homer Simpson,"Don't you worry, son."
Homer Simpson,My friends! Stop!
Hans Moleman,Please hurry.
Homer Simpson,"Sure, we could tear this house down..."
Homer Simpson,No! My friends! Stop!
Homer Simpson,"Let me finish. We could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves..."
Homer Simpson,"You could close down Moe's or the Kwik-E-Mart, and nobody would care / But the heart and soul of Springfield's in our Maison Derriere..."
Ned Flanders,"That's dignity, all right."
Belle,"WE'RE THE SAUCE ON YOUR STEAK, WE'RE THE CHEESE IN YOUR CAKE / WE PUT THE ""SPRING"" IN SPRING-FIELD...."
Dancer #1,"WE'RE THE LACE ON THE NIGHTGOWN,"
Dancer #2,"THE POINT AFTER TOUCHDOWN,"
BELLE/DANCERS,"YES, WE PUT THE ""SPRING"" IN SPRING-FIELD!"
Belle,WE'RE THAT LITTLE EXTRA SPICE THAT MAKES EXISTENCE EXTRA NICE / A GIDDY LITTLE THRILL AT A REASONABLE PRICE!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,OUR ONLY MAJOR QUARREL'S WITH YOUR TOTAL LACK OF MORALS.
Dancer #1,OUR SKIMPY COSTUMES AIN'T SO BAD!
Dancer #2,THEY SEEM TO ENTERTAIN YOUR DAD!
BELLE/DANCERS,"THE GIN IN YOUR MARTINI, THE CLAMS ON YOUR LINGUINI / YES, WE KEEP THE IN SPRING-FIELD!"
Townsmen Chorus,"WE REMEMBER OUR FIRST VISIT,"
Mayor Joe Quimby,THE SERVICE WAS EXQUISITE!
Mrs. Quimby,"WHY, JOSEPH, I HAD NO IDEA!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,"COME ON, NOW. YOU WERE WORKING HERE!"
Jasper Beardly,WITHOUT IT WE'D HAVE HAD NO FUN SINCE MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY-ONE!
Bart Simpson,"TO SHUT THEM DOWN NOW WOULD BE TWISTED,"
Kearney Zzyzwicz,WE JUST HEARD THIS PLACE EXISTED!
BELLE/DANCERS,"WE'RE THE HIGHLIGHTS IN YOUR HAIRDO,"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,THE EXTRA ARMS ON VISHNU!
BELLE/DANCERS,SO DON'T TAKE THE
Townsmen Chorus,WE WON'T TAKE THE
All,"YES, LET'S KEEP THE"
All,IN SPRI-NG-FIELD!
All,
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm convinced. The house stays!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"This house is a very, very, very fine house."
Marge Simpson,"Here I come, everybody!"
Townspeople,Stop! No!
Homer Simpson,"What are you doing, Marge? Didn't you hear the song?"
Marge Simpson,"No, I had to go rent the bulldozer."
Ned Flanders,"Well, we all changed our minds."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, now we love the house!"
Marge Simpson,What about the sleaze and the depravity?!
Helen Lovejoy,"It was a very convincing song, Marge."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Worthy of Webster's.
Seymour Skinner,Mmm-hmm. There were kicks and everything.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, can you sing it again?"
Ned Flanders,"I'm sorry, it really was one of those spur-of-the-moment-type things."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I also have a song to sing!"
,
Townspeople,
Marge Simpson,Uh... sorry.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Thanks a lot, Marge. That was our only burlesque house."
Belle,"I do love it when you drop by, Marge. Next time, why don't we get together at your house?"
Marge Simpson,I'm so sorry. How can I ever make this up to you?
Bart Simpson,"Oh, there's a way, Mom..."
Marge Simpson,"So, Twiggy, I hear you and your husband Woody just had a baby. What did you name him?"
Marge's Dummy,Chip!
Homer Simpson,Take it off!
Bart Simpson,"All right, Dad, you've been warned. Let's go."
Homer Simpson,Hey...
Bart Simpson,C'mon...
Homer Simpson,Easy...
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, can't we get some clear plates? I can't see the TV."
Marge Simpson,Is it really necessary to watch TV while we're eating? We're getting food all over.
Homer Simpson,Yoink.
Bart Simpson,"If you really wanted us to be neater, you'd serve us out of one long bowl."
Marge Simpson,You're talking about a trough! We're not going to eat from a trough! And another thing -- it's only 5:15. Why are you in your underwear?
Bart Simpson,"Hey, this ain't the Ritz."
Marge Simpson,"At least let's have a civilized conversation, shall we? Lisa, how was school?"
Lisa Simpson,How was what? What?
Marge Simpson,School. School.
Lisa Simpson,It's no time for school.
Marge Simpson,I know it's not! I'm going into the dining room to have a conversation. Anyone who wants to join me is welcome.
Bart Simpson,"Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesn't have a coat. Should I let him in?"
Marge Simpson,Hello Marge. How's the family? I don't want to talk about it. Mind your own business.
Homer Simpson,"Keep it down in there, everybody."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, is this the way you pictured married life?"
Homer Simpson,"Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. I pictured napkins... Homer, I want to throw a dinner party."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hate having parties. The toilet always gets backed up."
Marge Simpson,"I don't care if the sink shoots sludge, we're having a party."
,
Otto Mann,"Man, that is flagrant false advertising."
,
Marge Simpson,"It's just not a dinner party without a melon baller. And we'll need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... Ooh, an oyster mallet! ""Made in U.S.A.""? Eh, no thank you!"
Bart Simpson,Hey Lis -- check this out. Non-stick coating.
Bart Simpson,"Oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. Wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?"
Marge Simpson,Well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here."
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Bart, company's coming. Go put doilies under the coasters. Hurry! Hurry!"
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, quick. Screw these back on."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, calm down. The party's not for another three hours."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, good. That will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham."
Marge Simpson,Homer?!
Homer Simpson,Whaaaaaat?!
Marge Simpson,Are you ready?
Homer Simpson,I just gotta put my shoes on.
Marge Simpson,The only thing I asked you to do for this party was put on clothes. And you didn't do it.
Marge Simpson,"And now it's too late -- they're here. Bart, greet our guests and take their coats."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,My coat was stolen at last week's interfaith banquet. So I helped myself to a few of the better umbrellas.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, as you can see, we don't believe fur is murder. But paying for it sure is."
Hibbert Family,
Kirk Van Houten,"Uh, sorry we're late, but Luann had to put on her face. She doesn't want anyone to know she's got no eyebrows."
Kirk Van Houten,What? You don't!
Marge Simpson,"So, did anyone see that new Woodsy Allen movie?"
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, I like his films, except for that nervous fella who's always in 'em."
Luann Van Houten,"If you want to talk nervous, you should have seen Kirk deal with the high school boys who egged our Bonneville."
Kirk Van Houten,"Huh. I should have asked them to hurl some bacon, then maybe I coulda had a decent breakfast for once."
Homer Simpson,"You know what you two need? A little comic strip called ""Love Is."" It's about two naked eight year olds who are married."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Marge, if that was my last meal, I'd tell the warden ""Bring on the lethal injection."""
Kirk Van Houten,"Yeah. Marge, I know I haven't eaten that well since I was in the army."
Luann Van Houten,Or that noisily.
Kirk Van Houten,"All right, that's it!"
Marge Simpson,So who wants to play a game? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?
Ned Flanders,"Oo, that's a noodle scratcher."
,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, righty-o! It's good for keeping down the urges."
Kirk Van Houten,"Come on, Luann, you know what this is."
Luann Van Houten,"Kirk, I don't know what it is."
Kirk Van Houten,"It could not be more simple, Luann. You want me to show this to the cat and have the cat tell you what it is? 'Cause the cat's gonna get it."
Luann Van Houten,"I'm sorry I'm not as smart as you, Kirk. We didn't all go to Gudger College."
Kirk Van Houten,It's dignity! Gah! Don't you even know dignity when you see it?
Luann Van Houten,"Kirk, you're spitting."
Kirk Van Houten,"Okay, genius, why don't you draw dignity?!"
All,It's very good. /
Kirk Van Houten,"Well, it's no wonder I can't draw dignity. I gave it up when I married her."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Kirk, it's only a game. Sometimes we --"
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh, cram it, Churchy!"
Marge Simpson,Maybe we should all have a few drinks.
Luann Van Houten,"I'd have a drink, but it might loosen my tongue."
,
Homer Simpson,Shut up and let the woman talk.
Luann Van Houten,"Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story. It's about a man whose father-in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory..."
Homer Simpson,Boring!
Luann Van Houten,A man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial impotence...
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, here we go!"
Luann Van Houten,...sent the number one cracker factory in town into a tie for sixth with Table Time and Allied Biscuit.
Kirk Van Houten,"You wanna hear a secret, everybody? Luann loves it -- loves it! -- when I fail!"
Luann Van Houten,"Oh, yes, Kirk. I love having to borrow money from my sister! I love having to steal clothes from the church donation box!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, sweet Jesus!"
Marge Simpson,Lisa! Why don't you come sing for us!
Lisa Simpson,You're a grand old flag / You're a high flying flag / Etc...
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh, great. You got the kid singing! I hope you're happy now!"
Luann Van Houten,I am not happy. And I haven't been happy for a long time. I want a divorce!
Kirk Van Houten,"A divorce?! Sure, divorce. Hey, you got it, toots. And here's a picture even you can figure out."
Kirk Van Houten,It's a door. Use it!
Homer Simpson,That's a door?
Bart Simpson,"Hello, I'm Dr. Hibbert. I'm afraid I'm going to have to amputate your butt."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Alright, if you think you must."
Luann Van Houten,"Come on, Milhouse, we're going!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Aw, can't I come home later?"
Luann Van Houten,There's not going to be a home later.
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, okay. Ta-ta, I'm off to the beauty salon."
Homer Simpson,"G'night... Thanks for coming... We'll see you... Ba-bye... Well, I think that went pretty well."
Kirk Van Houten,What?
Marge Simpson,I feel terrible. The Van Houtens split up at our party.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago."
Marge Simpson,"I shouldn't have served those North Korean fortune cookies. They were so insulting: ""You are a coward."" No one likes to hear that after a nice meal."
Homer Simpson,You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once and move on.
Marge Simpson,You know who the real victim is in all this? Milhouse.
,
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Van Houten! I heard your folks broke up."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Aren't you going to say ""Haw haw?"""
Nelson Muntz,"Oh, by no means."
Nelson Muntz,"My dad left my mom after she got hooked on cough drops. By the end, her breath was so fresh, she wasn't really my mother anymore."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, so I guess I'm not alone."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Heh, you'll do fine. My divorce was tough on my kid, but he got over it."
"Kearney, Jr.",I sleep in a drawer.
,
Luann Van Houten,I dig the nightlife... 'Got to boogie...
Marge Simpson,"I must say, Luann, you're really handling this splendidly."
Luann Van Houten,"From now on, forget everything you thought you knew about Luann Van Houten --"
Marge Simpson,"Actually, Luann, I don't really know anything about yo--"
Luann Van Houten,Forget it. She's gone. Presto change-o. Kaboom! Sweet Fannie Adams! Bye-bye!
,
,
Kirk Van Houten,"Uh, singles life is great, Homer. I can do whatever I want. Today I drank a beer in the bathroom."
Homer Simpson,The one down the hall.
Kirk Van Houten,Yeah. And another great thing: you get your own bed.
Kirk Van Houten,I sleep in a racing car. Do you?
Homer Simpson,I sleep in a big bed with my wife.
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh, yeah."
Single Man,"Hey there, Kirk."
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh boy, what's going on? Patio party?"
Single Man,"Nah, a possum drowned in the pool. Do you have any garbage bags?"
Kirk Van Houten,"Uh, just throw it over the fence. Let Arby's worry about it."
Kirk Van Houten,That's Jerry. He's a major player down at the sewing store.
Homer Simpson,Thanks for introducing me.
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh, don't worry, Homer. You know me. And I'm a superstar at the cracker factory."
,
Kirk Van Houten,You're letting me go?
,
Cracker Executive,"Kirk, crackers are a family food. Happy families. Maybe single people eat crackers -- we don't know. Frankly, we don't want to know. But, it's a market we can do without."
Kirk Van Houten,"So that's it after twenty years? ""So long. Good luck?"""
Cracker Executive,"I don't recall saying ""good luck."""
,
Milhouse Van Houten,And the winner of the Milhouse 500 is... Milhouse!
Luann Van Houten,"Milhouse, are you sure you want to drive that inside?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Yes.
Luann Van Houten,"Okay. Be careful, sweet, sweet treasure."
Chase,"God I missed you, Lulu."
Luann Van Houten,"Chase, it's only been three hours."
Bart Simpson,Who's Chase?
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, that's Mom's new boyfriend."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I know you from ""American Gladiators."" You're Pyro!"
Chase,"Only on weekends. During the week, I'm just your average work-a-day stunt man."
Bart Simpson,Really?
Chase,"Go ahead, break a chair on me."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, thanks!"
Chase,"Okay, boys, I've gotta go. C'mon Lulu, let's roll."
,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,What the hell is wrong with you?!!
,
Bart Simpson,"Jeez, sorry. It's a pretty standard stunt, Homer."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, get ready!"
Homer Simpson,For what?
Marge Simpson,Remember? Luann and Chase are taking us out to hear Spalding Gray.
Homer Simpson,I don't wanna go to that.
Marge Simpson,You said you'd do it as a favor to me.
Homer Simpson,That doesn't sound like something I'd say.
Marge Simpson,Fine. I'll go without you.
Homer Simpson,Okay. Love you.
,
Kirk Van Houten,Homer! I want you to meet my new special lady. Say hello to Starla.
Starla,"Can I have the keys to the car, lover? I feel like changing wigs."
Kirk Van Houten,Okay.
Kirk Van Houten,Starla's a temp at K-ZUG Radio 530. She's going to help me launch my singing career.
Kirk Van Houten,My car!
Kirk Van Houten,Oh! My demo tape!
Homer Simpson,"Can I Borrow A Feeling? ""Can I Borrow A Feeling?"" There's your picture on the front."
Kirk Van Houten,"Go ahead, Homer. Laugh at me."
Homer Simpson,I already did.
Kirk Van Houten,"You know why all this happened, don't you? 'Cause I took my marriage for granted. Y'know, in twelve years, I never once helped out with the housework."
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. You gotta do that.
Kirk Van Houten,I could've at least stayed in shape for her.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and for yourself."
Kirk Van Houten,I could've taken just a little time to... to make her feel special.
Homer Simpson,It can't just be sex. It can't.
Kirk Van Houten,"God, I was so self-centered. No wonder I didn't see it coming. That's how it is, though: one day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day you're thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that's tough, pal. But it's never going to happen to me."
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh, how do you know? What makes you guys so special?"
Homer Simpson,'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner!"
Homer Simpson,"""Dear Homer,"" aww. ""Sorry you didn't want to join me tonight. I left you hot dogs for dinner. They're thawing in the sink."""
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dad. You know, there's buns in the cabinet."
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, wait! I know you're only eight years old and I don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, okay. Can I stay up?"
Homer Simpson,All right.
Homer Simpson,"As you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and I think your mom might not be happy with me."
Lisa Simpson,You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. Why would she leave you now?
Homer Simpson,'Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
Lisa Simpson,You mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
Homer Simpson,Mm-hm.
Lisa Simpson,She knows.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I knew this would happen. Our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot."
,
Flashback Homer,See? You don't have to spend a lot of money to have a first-class wedding reception.
Flashback Marge,"It's getting less and less likely you're going to yell ""Surprise"" and have all my friends jump out..."
Flashback Homer,"""Levi's."" Hey, you think that truck is full of jeans?"
Lisa Simpson,You're very lucky to have Mom.
Homer Simpson,That's your advice?! Go to bed!
,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning. You know, Marge, I was thinking about how much I enjoy your interests, so I wandered over to that theater you went to last night. And I bought tickets to their entire season."
Homer Simpson,"Look -- ""Mostly Madrigals."" Hey, that might be good. Ooh, ooh, ""An Evening With Philip Glass."" Just an evening? ""Voices of the Elderly Poor."""
Marge Simpson,"Homie, I appreciate this, but I'd really like to get some sleep."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, of course, my sweet. I'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you."
,
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. How many husbands would do that for their wives?
Marge Simpson,None! They would have more sense than that.
Homer Simpson,Ooh! You're feisty. I'm gonna give you a Madonna cut.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't need you around me 24 hours a day. I'm a grown woman -- I can take care of myself. Now, will you please just go away!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've just made things worse. A few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. Marge deserves someone who will treat her right. Marge deserves a fresh start."
,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to file, for divorce."
Clerk,These things happen eight dollars.
,
Marge Simpson,"Only three cavities, Bart. Your best check-up ever. I'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken."
Homer Simpson,Marge? Can you come in here? We need to talk.
Crowd,Surprise!
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, will you marry me?"
Marge Simpson,Why? Am I pregnant?
Homer Simpson,"No, it's a second wedding, Honey. Our first one was so crummy, I had to make it up to you. I really love you."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie. I know you love me. We don't need to get married again."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, we do. I got us a divorce this afternoon."
Marge Simpson,What?
Homer Simpson,"I didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on TV. This one is for real. I want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like Kirk and Luann."
Marge Simpson,We never will.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Dearly beloved --
Homer Simpson,Wait! I want one last chance to enjoy single life.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, ready."
Sherri Mackleberry,She was looking at Nelson!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"I will now read the special vows which Homer has prepared for this occasion. Do you Marge take Homer, in richness and in poorness?... Poorness is underlined... In impotence and in potence? In quiet solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered monkey-navigated -- And it goes on like this."
Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter. All I want to know is: Will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?
Marge Simpson,"I will. Oh Homie, of course I will."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife."
Marge Simpson,It's the most perfect wedding I could ever ask for. You even got a hip rock 'n' roll combo.
COMBO FRONTMAN,"Okay, everybody. Who likes the Doobie Brothers? 'Cause we got one of them."
Marge Simpson,What a wonderful evening! A magical way for two people to renew their love.
Kirk Van Houten,Marge is right.
Kirk Van Houten,I've got something I'd like to say.
Kirk Van Houten,Would you guys do a favor for a guy in love?
Bandmembers,Sure! / Yeah! / That's why we're here.
Kirk Van Houten,"Hi everybody. Uh, hi. And hit it! CAN I BORROW A FEELING? / COULD YOU LEND ME A JAR OF LOVE? / HURTIN' HEARTS NEED SOME HEALIN' / TAKE MY HAND WITH YOUR GLOVE OF LOVE."
Kirk Van Houten,"How about it, Luann? Will you marry me... again?"
Luann Van Houten,Ewwwww! No!
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh. Well, uh, can I have my shirts back, at least?"
Chase,"Okay, you heard the lady. Why don't you take it outside, all right?"
Kirk Van Houten,"Uh, I'll be back."
Kirk Van Houten,Probably.

Gary Chalmers,Skin-ner!!!
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, Superintendent Chalmers! What's wrong?!"
Gary Chalmers,Nothing. I just bought myself a car!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh... oh, good. This will sound crazy but at first I... I thought I'd enraged you again."
Gary Chalmers,Skin-ner!!!
Seymour Skinner,What?! What?!
Gary Chalmers,Now you're getting paranoid.
Gary Chalmers,"You know, I used to think a car was just a way of getting from Point A to Point B... and on weekends, Point C. But that was the old me. That man died the moment I laid eyes on the 1979 Honda Accord."
Seymour Skinner,"I've always admired car owners. And I hope to be one myself, as soon as I finish paying off Mother. She insists I pay her retroactively for the food I ate as a child."
Gary Chalmers,"Yes, yes, that's unfortunate... Well, Seymour, I make Superintendent money, which amply covers both food and car. Holy Jumping Caesar's Catfish!!"
Gary Chalmers,My 'H' has been stolen! Oh! That's how people know it's a Honda! What's the point of having a Honda if you can't show it off?!
Seymour Skinner,"Sir, if you'll just stop yelling at me, I'm sure I can find a replacement..."
Seymour Skinner,I'll just...
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Hey, get away from my car!"
Seymour Skinner,Uh-oh!
Gary Chalmers,Uh-oh!
Seymour Skinner,This way!

Homer Simpson,

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Good morning. One donut with sprinkles, and... Wait a minute -- these are not sprinkles, Sir!"
Homer Simpson,Whaddya mean?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,You have clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them on top of the donut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles!
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was like that when I got here. It really was."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"A Mounds bar is not a sprinkle! A Twizzler is not a sprinkle! A Jolly Rancher is not a sprinkle, Sir! -- Perhaps in Shangri-la they are, but not here!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Thank you, come again."
Chief Wiggum,"Ah, looks like we put the kibosh on another two-bit telephone swindle, boys. Frankly, I would've expected better from Jimmy the Scumbag."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this thing?"
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, yes. Uh, take a good look at him, Nelson, cause that's where you're headed."
Seymour Skinner,"After you claim your stolen merchandise, go directly to Mr. Muntz for an apology."
Chief Wiggum,"Huh? Oh, that's an auto-dialer. This bird was using it to pull a telemarketing scam, but instead he's gonna rot in the slammer for the next twenty years -- bread and water, icy showers, guards whompin' your ass 'round the clock, and the only way out is suicide."
Homer Simpson,"Telemarketing, eh?"
,
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, you think this stolen 'H' is a laugh riot, don't you? Well, I'll tell you something that's not so funny: right now, Superintendent Chalmers is at home crying like a little girl!"
All Students,
Seymour Skinner,"I guess it is a little funny... Nonetheless, I will find the culprit. We'll start with, oh, I don't know... Bart Simpson!"
Bart Simpson,"Um, I don't think you want to look in there, sir."
Seymour Skinner,Balderdash. I'll just stick my head right in and --
Seymour Skinner,Half a dozen eggs?!
Seymour Skinner,"Well, that would be the complete dozen... All right. Rather than tempt fate, I'll move along now."
Seymour Skinner,So we reach the bottom of the barrel: Nelson Muntz.
Nelson Muntz,Dum-da-da-dum!
Seymour Skinner,"The cold, hard process of elimination places the 'H' squarely in your locker!"
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Seymour Skinner,Damn! Dang! Darn!
Seymour Skinner,"A principal's ransom in stolen goods! Well sir, who's ""haw-hawing"" now, hmm?"
Nelson Muntz,"I'unno, but he's got lethal tuna-breath."
All Students,Ooooohh...
Lisa Simpson,"Who does Nelson think he's impressing, anyway, acting so cool all the time?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Not me!
Seymour Skinner,"All right, Mr. Smartenheimer, that does it!"
Seymour Skinner,"First, you're going to give back everything you've stolen, then I'm sentencing you to one week of the lowest, most degrading work known to man: janitorial work."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Aw, Jees, I'm standin' right here, sir."
Nelson Muntz,"Bite me... Cram it... You're dead... Get bent, ma'am..."
Lisa Simpson,Why do you have to be such a pain all the time? Don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?
Nelson Muntz,Don't you realize your butt sticks out?
Lisa Simpson,It does not!
Lisa Simpson,Hey!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
,
Marge Simpson,"An automatic dialer? Is that legal? I don't want you getting arrested, Homer..."
Homer Simpson,I won't.
Marge Simpson,Or swindling our neighbors.
Homer Simpson,Let me show you how it works. This baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. It automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. Listen.
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahoy-hoy?
Homer's Recording,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right now. So use it. And send one dollar to Happy Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. Don't delay! Eternal happiness is just a dollar away."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm. One dollar for eternal happiness... Mmmm, I'd be happier with the dollar."
Homer Simpson,Now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
Marge Simpson,But you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. It's nothing but panhandling!
Homer Simpson,Tele-panhandling.
,
Dewey Largo,"... And should there be a request for an encore, we will reprise ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" Otherwise, we won't file out quietly."
Groundskeeper Willie,And that's how Willie waters. Now you take the hooze.
Nelson Muntz,The moose?
Groundskeeper Willie,The hooze! The hooze!
Nelson Muntz,Is this right?
Groundskeeper Willie,Ach! Turn off the noozle!
Nelson Muntz,The noodles? What noodles?
Groundskeeper Willie,The noozle on the end of the hooze! Ach!
Lisa Simpson,
Dewey Largo,"Miss Simpson, do you find something funny about the word ""tromboner?"""
Lisa Simpson,"No, sir. I was laughing at something outside."
All Students,Lisa likes Nelson!
Milhouse Van Houten,She does not!
All Students,Milhouse likes Lisa!
JANEY,He does not!
All Students,Janey likes Milhouse!
Ãœter,She does not!
All Students,Uter likes Milhouse!
Dewey Largo,"Nobody likes Milhouse! Lisa, you've got detention!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, how does Bart do this every week?"
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Brainiac, since when do you get detention?"
Lisa Simpson,It's your fault! I accidentally laughed at your immature prank.
Nelson Muntz,"Haw. Yeah, the best part was when he got wet! Hey, you're doin' that the stupid way."
Nelson Muntz,"If you use that deal with the five chalks, you'll get done faster."
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks, but I prefer the honest way."
Nelson Muntz,Whatever. Smell ya later!
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, that was a good idea. And I can't believe it came from Nelson."
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, Willie, catch the football!"
Groundskeeper Willie,All right I--
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Milhouse, I've never told anyone this kind of thing before... but I've never felt this way before. I think I have a crush..."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, really?"
Lisa Simpson,...on Nelson Muntz.
Nelson Muntz,"Way to drink, Poindexter!"
Milhouse Van Houten,You like Nelson?! But he's a creep and he chipped one of my permanent teeth!
Lisa Simpson,"But I bet underneath, he's a sweet, sensitive person -- like you. I guess you could say I want to bring out the Milhouse in Nelson."
Milhouse Van Houten,"But I'm all Milhouse! Plus, my Mom says I'm the handsomest guy in school!"
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"I like you, too, Milhouse, but not in that way. You're more like a big sister."
Milhouse Van Houten,No I'm not! Why does everybody keep saying that?!
Lisa Simpson,"Would you do me a favor? When you get back to class, just give him this note."
Milhouse Van Houten,
Lisa Simpson,Please?
Milhouse's Thoughts,"When she sees you'll do anything she says, she's bound to respect you."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Sure, what's a big sister for? Oh, I shouldn'ta said that..."
Nelson Muntz,Guess who likes you?
Lisa Simpson,"Milhouse, I'm so sorry..."
Paramedic,He can't hear you now. We had to pack his ears with gauze.
Lisa Simpson,Nelson! Um... that note Milhouse gave you... it wasn't from him. It was from... me.
Nelson Muntz,You? Why would you like me? No girls like me. Are you wearing a wire?
Lisa Simpson,I don't know why I like you. I just do. So... what do you think?
Nelson Muntz,It's okay... I guess. Do I have to do anything?
Lisa Simpson,Well... would you like to come over to my house after school?
Nelson Muntz,"Okay... But if anybody sees us, I'm just there to steal your bike."
,
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Two dollars! It's working!
,
Grampa Simpson,I don't feel any happier. How 'bout you?
Jasper Beardly,Umm... a little.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, you've got to see this, it's so cute what she does. Be the baby, kitty. Go on, be the baby."

Snowball II,
Lisa Simpson,Snowball! I - don't - understand. She loves to climb in h--
Snowball II,
Nelson Muntz,I believe you! I don't care!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis, Mom said you had the toenail clippers and-- Whoa, Lisa! Look out! Nelson's in our house!"
Jimbo Jones,That is so gay!
Lisa Simpson,"It's okay, I invited him over. Nelson's my new... friend."
Bart Simpson,"Are you nuts? I'll probably never say this to you again, but you can do better."
Lisa Simpson,"Please don't ruin this for me, Bart. I think he's starting to like me!"
Bart Simpson,Milhouse likes you.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, please. Milhouse likes Vaseline on toast."
Bart Simpson,Hmmm.

Professor Jonathan Frink,"Aw, pawns can't move that way! Ya stupid arm..."
Professor Jonathan Frink,Lab...
Homer's Recording,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right... Etc."
Professor Jonathan Frink,"Why it's the AT-5000 Autodialer, my very first patent! Aw, wouldja listen to the gibberish they've got you saying! It's sad and alarming. You were designed to alert schoolchildren about snow days and such. Well, let's get you home to Frinky. Hope your wheels still work."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no you don't!"
,
Nelson Muntz,You're the first person I've had over to the house since my Dad went nuts.
,
Lisa Simpson,"""Nuke the whales?"" You don't really believe that, do you?"
Nelson Muntz,I'unno... Gotta nuke somethin'!
Lisa Simpson,TouchÃ©.
Lisa Simpson,You play the guitar?
Nelson Muntz,"Oh, yeah, I'm a superstar."
Lisa Simpson,Would you... play a song for me?
Nelson Muntz,Oh... okay.
Nelson Muntz,Joy to the world / The teacher's dead! / We bar-b-qued her head! / What happened to her bod-dy? / We flushed it down the pot-ty! / And round and round it goes / And round and round it... goes --
Lisa Simpson,I wish I could laugh at the idea of a teacher being decapitated.
,
Lisa Simpson,Hardly.
Nelson Muntz,"Listen, I'm gettin' pretty tired. I'm goin' to go to sleep for a while. Smell ya later!"
Lisa Simpson,How am I supposed to get home?
,
Nelson Muntz,I 'unno. Y'shoulda thought of that before you came over. Huh.
,
Lisa Simpson,"I feel so stupid, Mom. Nelson's not right for me at all. And I don't think he ever will be."
Marge Simpson,"Well, most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man... but those women are quitters!"
Lisa Simpson,What?
Marge Simpson,"When I first met your father, he was loud, crude, and piggish. But I worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person!"
Lisa Simpson,Mom...
Marge Simpson,"He's a whole new person, Lisa!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I know."
Marge Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,I wonder if I could change Nelson...
,
Lisa Simpson,Very sharp!
Nelson Muntz,"Aw, but I feel like such a tool!"
Lisa Simpson,"I know it's a change, but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side."
Nelson Muntz,"Aw, crap."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Isn't it nice up here? What are you thinking, Nelson?"
Nelson Muntz,What am I thinking about what?
Lisa Simpson,About anything.
Nelson Muntz,Nothin'.
Lisa Simpson,What do you feel? What's inside you right now?
Nelson Muntz,Guts and black stuff... and about fifty Slim Jims.
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Nelson! You must think and feel things. I mean, look where we are: a rolling green hillside, the stars coming out like God is lighting a million tiny candles, the moon looking down on us as if to say..."
Nelson's Brain,"This oughta shut her up. Hey, this isn't so bad..."
Nelson Muntz,That was pretty fine.
Lisa Simpson,"See, you do have a tender side. You just needed someone to bring it out."
Nelson Muntz,"Yeah, that was pretty rockin'..."
DOLPH,"Oh, man! You kissed a girl!"
Lisa Simpson,"Listen, you thugs, stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry!"
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Whoooooaa!
Lisa Simpson,You'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the feelings of a sweet young man!
Nelson Muntz,
Lisa Simpson,He's not like you anymore! He's changed! And he doesn't want to hang around with a buncha crumb-bums!
Jimbo Jones,Crumb-bums?! Nobody calls me a crumb-bum!
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, back off, James!"
Nelson Muntz,"I'll handle this, Lisa. You go have a fig bar."
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, thanks for embarrassing me, dingus!"
DOLPH,"You asked for it, man. You're broadcasting geek rays over the entire valley."
Nelson Muntz,'Fraid not! I'm still wicked bad.
Jimbo Jones,"Oh, yeah? Then prove it, assbutt. Come raid Skinner's house with us."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,We found a bunch of rancid cole slaw in the dumpster behind Krusty Burger...
DOLPH,"Yeah, and we're gonna go heave it at his house!"
Nelson Muntz,"Cool! I'd love to get even with Skinner... eh... eh, but I better not."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Chic-ken! / Lame-o! / Girl lover! / Fancy pants! / Charlatan!
Lisa Simpson,"You got rid of them! And you did it like a gentleman, without any violence."
Nelson Muntz,Yeah... I know you don't like that stuff.

Ned Flanders,Howdilly-doodilly.
Homer's Recording,"Greetings, friend. Do you wish to look as..."
Ned Flanders,Ach! It was that darn recording again!
Maude Flanders,Of course it was! It's been calling all night. Just unplug the phone.
Ned Flanders,Howdilly-dood...
Homer's Recording,"Greetings, friend..."
Ned Flanders,Dang!
Maude Flanders,I told you to unplug the phone!
Ned Flanders,But it could be my mother! Howdi...
Homer's Recording,Friend...
Ned Flanders,Shoot!
Kirk Van Houten,"Oh, let's just beat him up and take his stuff!"
Maude Flanders,"That is it, Ned! If you don't unplug that phone right now, you're sleeping on the lawn!"
Homer Simpson,Will you two shut up?! People are trying to sleep!!
,
Seymour Skinner,Great Barrier Reef! We're under attack!
Jimbo Jones,"Eat slaw, Skinner!"
Kearney Zzyzwicz,We're slawin' him up good!
DOLPH,Nelson doesn't know what he's missin'.
Jimbo Jones,Why's he wasting his time with that Simpson chick?
Nelson Muntz,'Cause your mom had a three month waiting list!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,All right! / I knew you'd be back! / What'd you say about my mom?!
Nelson Muntz,I missed you guys. Let's never fight again.
Seymour Skinner,Who's out there? Give me your names so I can tell the police!
Agnes Skinner,Seymour! What's going on? What's that odor?
Seymour Skinner,"Go back to bed, Mother! I've got it under control. Listen, you crumb-bums, if you think I'm impressed, I am not!"
Seymour Skinner,"I... ah, brandishing your buttocks is only getting me angrier!"
Agnes Skinner,I want to see what's going on!
Seymour Skinner,"No, Mother, don't look out the window!"
Agnes Skinner,
Seymour Skinner,
Nelson Muntz,Cops! Everybody split up!

Nelson Muntz,Lisa! The cops are chasing me. I need a place to hide!
Homer Simpson,Lisa's window is the next one!
Ned Flanders,Howdilly-doodily...
Homer's Recording,"Greetings, friend..."
Maude Flanders,"Ned, did you plug that phone back in?!"
Homer Simpson,Shut up!!
Nelson Muntz,"...and I wasn't even there, honest! Skinner's just out to get me!"
Lisa Simpson,That's so unfair!
Nelson Muntz,Uh-oh.
Lisa Simpson,Meet me at the back door!
Chief Wiggum,Aha! I had a feeling we'd find you here!
Lou,"Chief, No!!"
Eddie,What'd you do that for?
Marge Simpson,"Ooh, a Rubik's Cube. Let's all work it together."
Chief Wiggum,"Well, that thing's been drivin' the whole town nuts! Got me out of the bath seven times. Seven!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who shot the auto-dialer? Marge's auto-dialer?"
Chief Wiggum,"See ya in court, Simpson. Oh, and, uh, bring that evidence with ya, otherwise I got no case and you'll go scot-free, y'know."
Lou,"Uh, Chief, what about those cole slaw punks?"
Chief Wiggum,"Well, I... I can't be everywhere at once, Lou, now can I? You know, in most cities, the Chief of Police doesn't even go out on calls like these."
Lou,"Yeah, yeah, we know, Chief. / Well we appreciate it. / 'Count our blessings every day. / We're very appreciative..."
,
Lisa Simpson,I think they're giving up.
,
Nelson Muntz,Thanks for helpin' me out. You're a stand-up babe.
Nelson Muntz,"Hey, check it out. Skinner's moppin' the goo off his house."
Nelson Muntz,Wait'll he finds what I left in his birdbath!
Seymour Skinner,
Lisa Simpson,I thought you weren't there.
Nelson Muntz,"Huh? Oh, yeah, uh, I guess I was."
Lisa Simpson,You lied to me.
Nelson Muntz,Nuh-uh!
Lisa Simpson,"There, you did it again!"
Nelson Muntz,"All right, all right, I lied! I'm sorry. Let's kiss."
Lisa Simpson,"No. You don't understand, Nelson. A kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest."
Nelson Muntz,Um... there's a niceness to it...
Lisa Simpson,I was foolish to think I'd actually changed you. Maybe I was seeing things in you that weren't really there.
Nelson Muntz,Definitely.
Lisa Simpson,Then why did you want to be with me?
Nelson Muntz,"Mmm-hmm. Maybe 'cause you were the first person that ever thought there was a nice guy inside me. Well, guess you really blew that one, huh?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I guess this is it..."
Nelson Muntz,"You mean, like, goodbye?"
Lisa Simpson,"Let's just call it ""Smell ya later."""
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hi, Lisa! Could I talk to you, or would that just make Nelson whale on me again?"
Lisa Simpson,Don't worry. Nelson and I don't like each other anymore.
Milhouse Van Houten,Really? You got anybody in mind for your next crush?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm really not thinking about that now."
Lisa Simpson,I suppose it could be almost anybody...
Milhouse Van Houten,Yesssss!!
Homer's Recording,"Hello, this is Homer Simpson, a.k.a. ""Happy Dude."" The court has ordered me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam. I'm sorry.

Homer Simpson,... Is it... Wah?
Lisa Simpson,I think a hurricane is coming!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting Springfield."
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, but the records only go back to 1978, when the Hall of Records was mysteriously blown away!"
Santa's Little Helper,
Homer Simpson,"What is it, boy? Fire? Earthquake? Hippies?"
Homer Simpson,Hurricane! Somehow the animals are always the first to know.
Kent Brockman,... and the Weather Service has warned us to brace ourselves for the onslaught of Hurricane Barbara.
Kent Brockman,"And if you think naming a destructive storm after a woman is sexist, you obviously have never seen the gals grabbing for items at a clearance sale."

Lisa Simpson,We better pick up some supplies.

Marge Simpson,"Oh, there's so little left: Creamed Eels? Corn Nog? Wadded beef?"
Lisa Simpson,"Mo-om, let's just grab what we can and get out of here. This storm is making people crazy."
Mrs. Glick,"The last pineapple. And plenty ripe, too."
Lisa Simpson,But I'm not fruit! I'm a kid!
Mrs. Glick,That's what the pumpkin said.
Ralph Wiggum,"Hi, Lisa. We're going to be in a pie!"

National Guardsman,"Sir, for your own safety, we do advise you to evacuate."
Grampa Simpson,I ain't leavin'! I was born in this nursing home and I'll die in this nursing home!
National Guardsman,Is there any chance of you changing your mind?
Grampa Simpson,Sure. Let's go.

Maggie Simpson,
Ned Flanders,"Well, need some help there? You know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, it'll be fun. We're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. Make sure we don't owe anything extra."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sure I'd be a third wheel."
Ned Flanders,"No, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--"
Homer Simpson,I would make it my business to be a third wheel.
Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!"

Main Title Singers,The Hurri-cane...
,
Convict,"Awesome! So long, suckers!"
Prison Officials,Awww.
Prison Officials,Yay!
,
Marge Simpson,Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
Homer Simpson,Use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
Marge Simpson,My main finger?
Lisa Simpson,You've got to start backwards! / Orange to orange! Ignore the reds! / Alternate corners! /
Marge Simpson,One at a time.
Bart Simpson,Spin the middle side topwise. Topwise.
Marge Simpson,Now I remember why I put
Marge Simpson,this down here in the first place!
,
,
Marge Simpson,It's dying down!
Homer Simpson,"All clear, everyone."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, no! This may just be the eye of the hurricane."
Homer Simpson,Relax. Can't you see how eerily calm it is?
Homer Simpson,See? I told you it was over.
Homer Simpson,Hmm. I don't remember a bowling alley being th--
Marge Simpson,"Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all our friends. So if you could find it in your infinite wisdom to..."
Lisa Simpson,"Wait. Listen, everybody!"
Lisa Simpson,The hurricane's over.
Homer Simpson,"He fell for it! Way to go, Marge!"
Marge Simpson,Remarkable -- there doesn't seem to be any damage at all. It just goes to show you that everything will work out if you have faith.
Ned Flanders,It's all gone. Everything... gone-diddily-on.
,
Ned Flanders,Maude? Rod? Todd?
Todd Flanders,"I'm right here, Daddy."
Maude Flanders,"Oh, Neddy, it was terrifying. I thought I was headed for the eternal bliss of paradise."
Todd Flanders,Oh my gosh. Look at Rod!
Rod Flanders,I have a headache.
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, everyone's alive. Guess that's something to be thankful for."
Homer Simpson,Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
Marge Simpson,I'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
Homer Simpson,Talk to me!!
Maude Flanders,"Uh, well, no. Neddy doesn't believe in insurance -- he considers it a form of gambling."
Ned Flanders,"Y'know, it's kinda funny. The only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. They're all we have left."
Homer Simpson,"Well, call us if you need anything."
,
,
Todd Flanders,We got new clothes from the donation bin! I'm a surfer.
Rod Flanders,"Look, Daddy. Todd is stupid and I'm with him. And now Mommy's stupid."
Ned Flanders,"Lookin' good, Rod. Lookin' good."
Maude Flanders,"Neddy, I know this has been a terrible day. But, by golly, first thing tomorrow we're going to open up the Leftorium and before ya know it, we'll be back on our feet."
Kent Brockman,"...Down here at Springfield Mall a storm-addled crowd appears to have turned its rage on ""The Leftorium."""
Kent Brockman,"Surprisingly, people are grabbing things with both hands, suggesting it's not just southpaws in this rampaging mob."
Ned Flanders,
Kent Brockman,"Try looking in the back. Meantime, Springfield bowlers will be happy to hear that the Bowl-A-Rama is back in business at its new location teetering over the Carter-Dixon Tunnel."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend Lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today -- Uh, I... I kinda feel like Job."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well... Aren't you being a tad melodramatic, Ned? Also, I believe Job was right-handed."
Ned Flanders,"But Reverend, I need to know. Is God punishing me?"
,
Ned Flanders,"Even in my darkest hour, I can turn to the Good Book for..."
Ned Flanders,Son of a gun-diddily-un! Those gilded edges smart!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Now, this is the room with electricity, but it has too much electricity. So I don't know, you might want to wear a hat."
Ned Flanders,Uh-huh. Floor feels a little gritty here.
Ned Flanders,"Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to people. I don't drink or dance or swear. I've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. I've done everything the Bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. What more could I do? I... I feel like I'm coming apart here. I want to yell out, but I... I... I just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. I... I...I..."
Marge Simpson,Ned! Maude! You've got to go back to your house. Something incredible has happened!
Ned Flanders,"Aw, what happened now? Did the rubble burn down?"
Marge Simpson,No! Come on!
,
,
Maude Flanders,"Oh, they rebuilt our house!"
Ned Flanders,It's a miracle!
Marge Simpson,"I started making some calls last night, and before I knew it, practically all of Springfield was offering to help."
Citizens,Glad to do it. / Sure. / Happy to help out. / Etc.
Homer Simpson,"Hope you like it, neighbor. We didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,And a cement mixer full of hope and some cement.
Ned Flanders,"It's wonderful. I... I... I don't know how I can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield."
Happy Man,"No, no, not me, friends -- he's talking about himself! But thanks for looking!"
,
Homer Simpson,The living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Ooh, looks like a loose nail."
Homer Simpson,"Eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad."
Homer Simpson,"Your beautiful kitchen, Ned. Just as you remember it."
Ned Flanders,"Was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, Ned, you ever tried lugging a toilet up a flight of stairs?"
Bart Simpson,Lisa and I built your room.
Rod Flanders,But I don't like this clown!
Bart Simpson,"Uh, I wouldn't take it down if I were you. It's a load-bearing poster."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, we ran out of floorboards there, so we painted the dirt. Pretty clever."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway!"
Barney Gumble,Come on in. It's your master bedroom.
Barney Gumble,"Ow, my nose!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, I've seen about enough."
Homer Simpson,"So, Flanders, what do you think of the house that love built?"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, shoot."
Ned Flanders,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now, calm down Neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... They did their best... Shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... Gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- Aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! Can't you morons do anything right?!!"
Citizens,
Marge Simpson,"Ned, we meant well, and everyone here tried their best --"
Ned Flanders,"Well, my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your family is out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have goooood intentions."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, back off, man."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, okay ""Dude."" I wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""Man."" Here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""Hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
Citizens,
Bart Simpson,I am shocked and appalled.
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Flanders, with all due respect, Bart didn't do anything."
Ned Flanders,Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson -- Springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
Chief Wiggum,
Ned Flanders,"What do we have here? The long, flabby arm of the law. The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of Mallomars."
Krusty the Clown,"Mallomars. Oh, that's going in the act."
Ned Flanders,"Oh yeah, the clown. The only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. And as for you -- I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a jerk."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, I've only been here a few minutes. What's going on?"
Ned Flanders,"You ugly, hate-filled man."
Young Dr. Foster,Ned! Stop it at once! Stop it! --
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I, uh... what was the third thing you said?"
Ned Flanders,"Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I got off pretty easy."
Maude Flanders,"Neddy! Uh, wait! Well, where you going?"
,
Ned Flanders,
,
Ned Flanders,I attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. I'd like to commit myself.
Receptionist,"Very well. Shall I show you to your room, or would you prefer to be dragged off, kicking and screaming?"
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, kicking and screaming, please."
Receptionist,As you wish.
Ned Flanders,Noooooooooooo!
,
Older Nurse,Flanders? Ned Flanders?
Older Nurse,I'd better call Dr. Foster.
,
Dr. Foster,"Yes, Doctor Foster here. Ned Flanders? You're sure? No, no, no, I'll... I'll come right over. And may God have mercy on us all."
Dr. Foster,"Darling, there's an emergency at the hospital. Er, where are my shoes?"
Wife,"Oh, I think they're in the den."
Dr. Foster,In the den? May God have mercy on us all.
,
,
Dr. Foster,"Well, how are you feeling this evening?"
Ned Flanders,"Uh, actually, I'm a little chilly. Could I have another straitjacket?"
Dr. Foster,Of course.
Ned Flanders,Thank you. Doctor Foster?
Dr. Foster,"Hmm, at least your memory's not crazy."
Dr. Foster,"Now, Ned, you may remember we spent some time together thirty years ago. Do you recall what you were like back then?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, sure. I was a good little boy."
Dr. Foster,Were you?
Young Ned,"Whee, I'm Dick Tracy! Bam! Take that, Prune Face! Now, I'm Prune Face! Take that, Dick Tracy! Now, I'm Prune Tracy! Take that, Dick Fay!"
Ned Flanders,I can't believe I was such a terror.
Dr. Foster,"Well, neither could your parents. That's why they brought you to me."
Young Dr. Foster,"Well, I'm afraid young Ned is unusually aggressive, but I can't seem to find a cause for it. Hey, hey, get down from that bookshelf, please! Most of those books haven't been discredited yet. Would you please tell your son to stop."
"Nedward Flanders, Sr.","We can't do it, man. That's discipline. That's like tellin' Gene Krupa not to go boom, boom, bap, bap, bap..."
Young Dr. Foster,"Hmm, lack of discipline. I'm beginning to see the problem."
"Nedward Flanders, Sr.","We don't believe in rules. Like, we gave them up when we started living like freaky beatniks."
Young Dr. Foster,"You don't believe in rules, yet you want to control Ned's anger."
Mona Flanders,"Yeah. You've got to help us, doc. We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas."
Young Dr. Foster,Hmm. There is an experimental therapy that might help Ned contain his anger...
Dr. Foster,It was known as the University of Minnesota Spankological Protocol.
Young Dr. Foster,"And that's just about eight months... now. Well, Ned, how do you feel?"
Young Ned,I feel... fine.
Young Dr. Foster,You don't feel angry?
Young Ned,Absa-tively not-a-reeno.
Young Dr. Foster,How do you feel about me?
Young Ned,Pretty darn-diddly-doodly good.
Dr. Foster,"The only problem with the treatment was that it worked too well. You became unable to express any anger at all. From that point on, anytime you felt angry, you could only respond with a string of nonsensical jabbering."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'll be darn-diddly-arned."
Dr. Foster,"Now that's the stuff. You suppressed your rage for so long, it finally erupted as a massive public explosion."
Ned Flanders,It sure did-diddly-id.
Dr. Foster,"All right, all right, just watch it there. I'm here to help, you know. Now, I'd like to try something -- is there any person who makes you particularly angry?"
,
Homer Simpson,Beer! Gimme some beer!
Homer Simpson,"Yello? Yes... Mental hospital? I don't know any ""Ned Flanders."""
Marge Simpson,The man who lived next door until his house blew down.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, him."
,
,
Dr. Foster,"Mr. Simpson? Dr. Foster. Please come with me. You folks are free to roam the grounds. Uh, just remember -- one of our patients is a cannibal. Try to guess which one. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
Crazy Man,
Jay Sherman,It stinks! It stinks! It stinks!
Orderly,"Yes, Mr. Sherman, everything stinks."
Dr. Foster,We want to teach Ned to release his anger in healthy doses. We need someone so irritating that Ned simply will not be able to repress his rage.
Dr. Foster,"Homer, can you be that annoying?"
Homer Simpson,I... What?
Dr. Foster,Get in the booth.
,
Homer Simpson,"""Ned Flanders, I mock your value system. You also appear foolish in the eyes of others."""
Ned Flanders,"Well, howdy, Homer!"
Ned Flanders,"Ooh, thanks for dropping by!"
,
Dr. Foster,Mmm. He's not responding. Proceed to Level Two Antagonism.
Homer Simpson,Past instances in which I professed to like you were fraudulent.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, well, I'll just have to try harder! Oops, thanks for dropping by."
Dr. Foster,"Ah, he's still repressing. Maximum hostility factor."
Homer Simpson,I engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. Now that's psychiatry! Eh? Eh?
Ned Flanders,"Ho ho ho. Very funny, wise guy."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly."
Ned Flanders,"Hi, neighbor!"
Homer Simpson,"You know what your problem is, Flanders? You're afraid to be human."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, now, why would I be afraid of that?"
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,Because humans are obnoxious sometimes. Humans hate things.
Ned Flanders,"Well, maybe a few of them do. Back East."
Dr. Foster,I can't find what Homer's saying. Did you write that?
Assistant,"Um, did you like it?"
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Flanders. There's got to be something you hate. What about mosquito bites?"
Ned Flanders,"Mmm, mmm. 'Sure are fun to scratch. Mmm. Satisfying."
Homer Simpson,"What about, uh, fluorescent lights?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, they hum like angels. You're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light."
Homer Simpson,See? You like everything.
Ned Flanders,"No, that's not true. I... I... I don't like the service at the post office. Y'know, it's all rush, rush, get you in, get you out. Then, they've got those machines in the lobby. They're even faster. No help there. You might even say I hate the post office. That, and my parents. Lousy beatniks! Hey, that felt good!"
Dr. Foster,He just said he hates his parents. Do you know what that means?
Assistant,"Uh, what do you think?"
Dr. Foster,It means he's cured!
Assistant,That's what I said.
,
Citizens,
Ned Flanders,"Thanks, everyone. I'm all better now. No more storing up the anger 'til I explode. If any of you does something I don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"
Dr. Foster,"Yes, that's very healthy, Ned."
Ned Flanders,"And if you really tick me off, I'm gonna run you down with my car!"
Citizens,
Homer Simpson,"Ned, you so crazy."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, why do they have to put all this crud in my newspaper? ""World""... ""The Arts""... ""Religion"" Aha! Here it is: ""Kickin' Back!"""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
Lisa Simpson,Not me.
Bart Simpson,Not me. I'm more of a mail-tamperer.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I happen to like handicrafts much more than stuffing my face."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Well, don't look at me... just because I'm holding a pair of scissors. Scissors which I need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains."
Homer Simpson,"Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?"
Homer Simpson,Where? To the big annual what?
Homer Simpson,"Lenny? Aw, well. If it was big and annual I'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. But something's a little off..."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, you don't smoke!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco."
Homer Simpson,You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.
Marge Simpson,"No, Homie, wait!"
Homer Simpson,"What's wrong with you? What are you trying to hide from m-- What's that smell? Onions... Chili powder... Cumin... Juicy ground chuck... It's chili! Oh my God, I'm missing the Chili Cook-Off!"
Homer Simpson,I'm missing the Cook-Off! It's going on right now and I'm missin' it!
Marge Simpson,"All right, I was trying to keep it from you, but I had a good reason. Every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. Remember last year?"
,
Homer Simpson,Look at me! I'm a puffy pink cloud!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, of course... everything looks bad if you remember it. Now where are my chili boots? Ah!"
Marge Simpson,"Okay, we'll go to the Chili Cook-Off. But I want you to promise me you won't have any beer."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, quit naggin' me. I won't have any beer. Geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?"
Marge Simpson,"Mmm, I suppose I could..."
,
Lisa Simpson,I'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat.
Bart Simpson,I'm gonna go claim some valuables at the Lost and Found.
Marge Simpson,"Ooh, look at that adorable spice rack!"
Marge Simpson,"Eight spices! Oh, some must be doubles. ""Or-uh-GAHN-o?"" What the hell...?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, we're missing the chili! Less artsy, more fartsy!"
Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.
Marge Simpson,Remember your promise: no drinking.
Homer Simpson,Stupor Pooper.
HELEN,"Howdy howdy, Marge and Hom-- oh, my mistake, Homer's not even with you! Probably just knocking back a few ""refreshments."""
Marge Simpson,"Thank you for your concern, Helen. Homer isn't drinking today."
HELEN,Oh. I think it's lovely that he said that... and that you believed him!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Now, Helen, let us not glory in Homer's binge-drinking. There but for the grace of God goes Marge herself."
Otto Mann,"Oh, man, he's here! The dude with the fireproof stomach!"
Various Onlookers,The spoon!
Lenny Leonard,"They say he carved it himself, from a bigger spoon."
Homer Simpson,"Five-alarm chili, eh?"
Ned Flanders,Um-hm.
Homer Simpson,"One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?"
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
Todd Flanders,"Daddy, are you going to jail?"
Ned Flanders,"We'll see, son. We'll see."
Waylon Smithers,"Evenin', little lady. Do you reckon a square could get a dance?"
Marge Simpson,It looks so complicated... Do you know how?
Waylon Smithers,"Ma'am, I wouldn't honk the honk if I couldn't tonk the tonk."
Marge Simpson,Woo-woo!
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh."
Chief Wiggum,"That Simpson, he thinks he's the Pope of Chilitown. Well, this year I am ready for him!"
Homer Simpson,"Hello, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,"Afternoon, Homer. Care for some chili? I've added an extra ingredient just for you. The merciless peppers of Quetzlzacatenango!"
Chief Wiggum,Grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum.
Homer Simpson,"Uh, Wiggy...? My chili's gettin' cold."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Hot! Hot!
Marge Simpson,You promised you wouldn't drink!
Homer Simpson,But I need it!
Homer Simpson,"Aw, lousy Wiggum. Now the whole town thinks I'm a chili wuss..."
Ralph Wiggum,"Wait, mister! You're drinking a candle!"
Ralph Wiggum,"You don't wanna get wax in your mouth, do you?"
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do."
Homer Simpson,Outstanding.
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, everybody, look who's back! It's the biiig baby! Oh, this porridge is too hot! Oh, waah waah waah!"
Crowd,
Chief Wiggum,"Want some more, do ya? Well, sure! Heck, it's not my job to talk people outta killin' themselves..."

Homer Simpson,"More, please."
Mayor Joe Quimby,Good Lord! This can't be happening!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"By all medical logic, steam should be shootin' out of his ears!"
Krusty the Clown,His ears if we're lucky!
Homer Simpson,"Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it."
Homer Simpson,Ooh. I don't feel so good.
Homer Simpson,Flanders! You gotta help me!
Ned Flanders,"Sure, buddy, I'd be happy to..."
Ned Flanders,...help out. What can I do-diddily-do...diddily-doodily-diddily-hoobily-hobbily-hibbily-gooble-gobble-gooble-gooble-gabba-gabba-hey?

Homer Simpson,Where am I? Shelbyville?
Homer Simpson,"Come on, Marge! Will you... Fight fair! I never do this to you!"
Homer Simpson,"Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils..."
Homer Simpson,Oh... kay. I think I'm gonna be leaving now.
Homer Simpson,"Huh? Sunrise, sunset... Sunrise, sunset... SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET..."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Note to self: stop doing anything.

Marge Simpson,Has anyone seen Homer?
HELEN,"Marge, better you hear it from me than some gossipy neighbor -- Homer made a total jackass of himself."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, Helen, that's enough. Call off your dogs."
HELEN,"Oh, but someone had to tell her. And I got here first!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Helen, zip it! Zip!"
Helen Lovejoy,"Oh, please... Tim!..."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Ziparoo!
Marge Simpson,"No beer, huh? I guess I know what a promise from Homer J. Simpson is worth."

Homer Simpson,Hey buddy! Get back there with the other rocks!
Homer Simpson,Huh? A tortoise?
Homer Simpson,Follow... the... This must be why I'm here! Follow the what? Follow the what? Hurry up!
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on!"

Homer Simpson,"This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?"
,
Bart Simpson,"Lis, check it out. Time for chili."
Lisa Simpson,"I saw it, Bart."
Bart Simpson,You're just mad cause there's no clock in your hat.
Lisa Simpson,What hat?
Bart Simpson,"Aw, this baby's wasted on an idiot like you. Where's Homer?"
Marge Simpson,Your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. Or a police car.
,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Thank God you're here! Where's the car?
Homer Simpson,"Marge? Marge? Oh, now what? If you're still mad at me, I'm gonna be really mad."
Homer Simpson,"Aw, I hate this place! Why am I here?!"
Voice,You are on a quest for knowledge.
Homer Simpson,Who said that?
Coyote,"Fear not, Homer. I am your spirit guide."
Homer Simpson,Hiya.
Coyote,There is a lesson you must learn.
Homer Simpson,"If it's about laying off the insanity peppers, I'm way ahead of you."
Coyote,"No, I speak of a deeper wisdom. The problem, Homer, is that the mind is always chattering away, with a thousand thoughts at once."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's me all right."
Coyote,Clarity is the path to inner peace.
Homer Simpson,But what should I do? Should I meditate? Should I get rid of all my possessions?
Coyote,"Are you kidding? If anything, you should get more possessions. You don't even have a computer!"
Homer Simpson,"You know, I have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and I would -- Hey!!"
Coyote,
Homer Simpson,Knock it off!
Coyote,Sorry. I am a coyote...
Homer Simpson,"Look, just gimme some inner peace, or I'll mop the floor with ya."
Coyote,"Good. Your mind is in a state of readiness. So listen well: To make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate."
Homer Simpson,Soul mate?
Coyote,"Your kindred spirit. The one with whom you share an unspoken bond... a profound, mystical understanding."
Homer Simpson,"That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge."
Coyote,Is it?
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait! Come back!..."
Homer Simpson,A ghost train! And so little time to get out of the way!... Now less!... Now none!
Homer Simpson,

Homer Simpson,
Kent Brockman,"Hey, get off the course, you bum! Security!"
Homer Simpson,"Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!"
Homer Simpson,Carl?
Homer Simpson,And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
Dog,"Hi, Homer. Find your soul mate."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, wait a minute. There's no such thing as a talking dog."
Dog,
Homer Simpson,Damn straight.

Bart Simpson,"So then I says to Mabel, I says..."
Homer Simpson,"Hi, kids."
Bart Simpson,"I'll finish this later. Hi, Dad."
Homer Simpson,Where's your mother?
Lisa Simpson,Out back.
Bart Simpson,"So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says..."
Homer Simpson,"Hi, honey."
Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. I guess you're cranky because I didn't come home last night...
Marge Simpson,"I'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. You broke your promise, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate."
Marge Simpson,"Don't ""soul mate"" me!"
Homer Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,"That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common..."
Homer Simpson,"Look at these records! Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers! Now look at her records... They stink! Maybe I had that crazy dream for a reason..."
Homer Simpson,"Wherever my soul mate is, it's not here."
Homer Simpson,"...I always just figured my wife was my soul mate. But if it's not Marge, then who is it? Where do I begin looking?"

Homer Simpson,"Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer."
Barney Gumble,"Okay, but I'm not your soul mate. I'm really more of a chum."

Lenny Leonard,I'm a crony.
Carl Carlson,I'd say acquaintance.

Homer Simpson,"Hello? Is this G-B-M? Uh, yeah. I read in the personals you were seeking a soul mate and, well, I also like rainy days and movies. Uh huh... uh, no, I don't like that. Or that. No, it's not that I'm afraid. I'm gonna hang up now. Bye-bye. Oh, I give up."
Coyote,"Find your soul mate, Homer. Find your soul mate."
Homer Simpson,Where? Where?!
Coyote,This is just your memory. I can't give you any new information.
,
Homer Simpson,Huh. What's that blinking light?
Homer Simpson,The lighthouse keeper!
,
Homer Simpson,The loneliest man in the world! He'll understand me!
Homer Simpson,Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!
Homer Simpson,"Here I come, buddy! No more loneliness for Homer and Earl...."
,
Homer Simpson,"A machine? Earl's a machine. Oh, that's just perfect! Homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! Oh, wow!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, look! Is that Dad?"
Lisa Simpson,Either that or Batman has really let himself go.
Homer Simpson,"Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
Homer Simpson,A ship! A ship with people! I know... I'll bring them to me! And then they'll have to be my friends!
Homer Simpson,"Come here, people!"
,
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Arr, Matey, nary a warning light to be seen. 'Tis clear sailing ahead for our precious cargo."
First Mate,"Uh... would that be the hotpants, sir?"
Captain Horatio McCallister,Aye... the hotpants.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I won't be lonely for long...."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, thank goodness you're safe!"
Homer Simpson,Marge?
Marge Simpson,"I woke up and you weren't there, and I was so worried..."
Homer Simpson,Really? You were? But how did you find me?
Marge Simpson,"Well, I was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. And I was sure you'd head west, because Springfield slopes down that way. And then I saw the lighthouse, and I remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron..."
Homer Simpson,"Or that little guy on the ""Don't Walk"" sign."
Marge Simpson,Yeah.
Homer Simpson,"Wow, Marge, you really do understand me. See, I thought we weren't soul mates because..."
Marge Simpson,...we had a fight?
Homer Simpson,"Right, and we don't like the same things. It's like you're from Venus..."
Marge Simpson,...and you're from Mars.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep..."
Homer Simpson,...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...
Marge Simpson,...a profound mystical understanding?
Homer Simpson,"Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!"
Homer Simpson,"We're number one! We're number one! In your face, space coyote!"
Marge Simpson,Space coyote?
Homer Simpson,Omigod! The ship!
Marge Simpson,We'll all be killed!
Homer Simpson,The light! We gotta get the light back on!
Captain Horatio McCallister,Jonathan Livingston Seagull! We're on a collision course! Hard a-starboard!
First Mate,"Um, port."
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Aye, port."
,
Homer Simpson,They see us! They're starting to turn!
Marge Simpson,We did it!
Homer Simpson,We sure did... soul mate.
Chief Wiggum,Look at all them hot pants!
Lenny Leonard,Hey! Who likes short shorts?
Crowd,We like short shorts!
,
Leonard Nimoy,"Hello, I'm Leonard Nimoy. The following tale of alien encounters is true. And by true, I mean false. It's all lies. But they're entertaining lies. And in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is no."
Leonard Nimoy,Our story begins on a Friday morning in a little town called Springfield.
,
Homer Simpson,"TGIF! Guys, I'm off to Moe's."
Lenny Leonard,"But Homer, it's ten in the morning."
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. I think it was called ""The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down."" First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so..."
Homer Simpson,"Then, I insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"So, another Friday is upon us. What'll you be doing, Smithers? Something gay, no doubt."
Waylon Smithers,W-what?
C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, lighthearted. Fancy free. ""Mothers lock up your daughters, Smithers is on the town!"""
Waylon Smithers,"Exactly, sir."
,
Jasper Beardly,Thank God it's Wednesday.
Mrs. Glick,It's Friday.
Jasper Beardly,Uh-oh. Wrong pills.
Jasper Beardly,"Eh, little help."
,
Video Arcade Man,"Sorry, Donkey Kong. You're just not a draw anymore."
Video Arcade Man,"Hey, he's still got it."
Milhouse Van Houten,Thirty-eight... thirty-nine... forty quarters. This better be good.
Kevin Costner Voice,Game over. Please deposit forty quarters.
Milhouse Van Houten,What a rip!
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Thank God it's Friday.
Hans Moleman,Hello? Hello?
,
Marge Simpson,Bad dog!
Marge Simpson,Bad cat!
,
Marge Simpson,Bad fawn! Hmm. Shoo! Shoo!
Lisa Simpson,All right! It's time for ABC's TGIF lineup!
Bart Simpson,"Lis, when you get a little older you'll learn that Friday's just another day between NBC's Must-See Thursday and CBS's Saturday Night Crap-o-rama."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Another Duff, Homer?"
Homer Simpson,"Nah, it's Friday night Moe. I wanna try something special."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, sure, sure."
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, here you go. DÃ¼ff. From Sweden."
Homer Simpson,Skoal! Wait a minute -- this is Duff!
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, ha ha, you got me, didn't ya? All right, here you go -- ""Red Tick Beer."""
Homer Simpson,"Hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something I can't quite put my finger on."
,
Worker,Hmm... needs more dog.
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, it's one a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids."
Moe Szyslak,"Just a second, Homer, you gotta take a breathalyzer test before I let you drive home."
Homer Simpson,"Eh, I guess I'll walk home."
,
,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
,
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, son, I'm glad to see ya. I went for the morning paper and I got lost, and..."
Homer Simpson,"No time for you, old man!"
Grampa Simpson,Aww.
Homer Simpson,"Please, don't hurt me!"
Alien,Don't be afraid.
Homer Simpson,Yaaaa...
Homer Simpson,Uh!
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, it's two a.m.! What happened?"
Homer Simpson,"It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, ""Don't be afraid!"""
Marge Simpson,Have you been drinking?
Homer Simpson,"No! Well, ten beers..."
,
Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet."
Lisa Simpson,Maybe you just dreamed it.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo! Explain that!"
Marge Simpson,More sausage?
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, according to ""Junior Skeptic Magazine"" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours."
Homer Simpson,So?
Lisa Simpson,"It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs! Oh, and you, Dad. Heh heh..."
Bart Simpson,I am the thing from Uranus!
Homer Simpson,Oh. It's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
Bart Simpson,It's your birthday?
Homer Simpson,"Yes. Remember, it's the same day as the dog's?"
Lisa Simpson,"Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday? We've got to get you a present! Yes we do! Yes we do!"
Bart Simpson,We love you boy!
Marge Simpson,Good doggy. Good doggy!
Homer Simpson,Lousy loveable dog.
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was awful. They set me on a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes and the -- oh wait, that was my physical."
Carl Carlson,"Great story, Homer. Really."
,
Homer Simpson,The alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night -- like Urkel!
Chief Wiggum,"Well, your story is very compelling, Mr. Jackass... I mean, uh, Simpson. So I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter."
Homer Simpson,You don't have to humiliate me.
Guilty Man,I just torched a building downtown... and I'm afraid I'll do it again.
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, right, I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter. Fruitcake."
,
Fox Mulder,"Look at this, Scully. There's been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the heartland of America."
Fox Mulder,We've got to get there right away.
Groundskeeper Willie,Ay! It's a monster! Kill it! Kill it!
Dana Scully,"Well gee, Mulder, there's also this report of a shipment of drugs and illegal weapons coming into New Jersey tonight."
Fox Mulder,I hardly think the FBI's concerned with matters like that.
,
Marge Simpson,"Hello, can I help you?"
Fox Mulder,"Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI."
Marge Simpson,"I-Is this about that pen that I took from the Post Office? I-I swear I didn't know I put it in my purse. Then I was going to bring it back, but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse..."
Dana Scully,"Actually, we're here to see your husband about his UFO encounter."
Marge Simpson,Oh. Come. Come in.
,
Dana Scully,"Mr. Simpson, look at this lineup, and tell us if any of these are the aliens you saw."
Alf,Yo!
Homer Simpson,"No, I'm sorry."
MARVIN-THE-MARTIAN-TYPE,"Oh, this makes me very angry."
,
Dana Scully,Now we're going to run a few tests. This is a simple lie-detector. I'll ask you a few yes-or-no questions and you just answer truthfully. Do you understand?
Homer Simpson,Yes.
,
Homer Simpson,Ow.
Fox Mulder,"Wait a minute, Scully. What's the point of this test?"
Dana Scully,No point. I just thought he could stand to lose a little weight.
Fox Mulder,His jiggling is almost hypnotic.
Dana Scully,"Yes, it's like a lava lamp."
,
,
Fox Mulder,"All right, Homer. We want you to recreate your every move the night you saw this alien."
Homer Simpson,"Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's Club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon."
Dana Scully,"Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the FBI."
Homer Simpson,We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?
Homer Simpson,"You are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that."
Waylon Smithers,It's not a monster! It's Mr. Burns!
Homer Simpson,"I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God, I love her. I-- Hey, a penny!"
Moe Szyslak,"So, uh, who are you guys anyhow?"
Fox Mulder,"Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI."
Moe Szyslak,"FBI, huh? Uh, S'cuse me."
,
Moe Szyslak,"All right, they're on to us. Get him back to Sea World!"
Whale,
,
Homer Simpson,"So I says ""Blue M & M, red M & M, they all wind up the same color in the end."""
Dana Scully,"Homer, why don't you show us where you went when you left the bar?"
,
Homer Simpson,"I was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods."
Grampa Simpson,"For the love of God, help me. I've been here for four days, and a turtle's got ahold of my teeth. There he is!"
Grampa Simpson,Come back here you! Slow down! I'll git ye!
Dana Scully,This is the worst assignment we've ever had.
Fox Mulder,Worse than the time we were attacked by the flesh-eating virus?
Grampa Simpson,Ow! He bit me with my own teeth!
Dana Scully,"No, this is much more irritating. I've seen enough, Mulder. Let's go."
Fox Mulder,"Yeah, okay. But somewhere out there something is watching us. There are alien forces acting in ways we can't perceive."
Fox Mulder,"Are we alone in the universe? Impossible, when you consider the wonders that exist all around us... the voodoo priests of Haiti, the Tibetan numerologists of Appalachia, the unsolved mysteries of ""Unsolved Mysteries."" The truth is out there!"
Moe Szyslak,Who'd've thought a whale could be so heavy? Cheese it. The Feds!
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""I believe you, Homer."""
Marge Simpson,"I don't believe you, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"You do?! Oh, Marge, you've made me so happy!"
Marge Simpson,You're not listening. You're only hearing what you want to hear.
Homer Simpson,Thanks! I'd love an omelet right about now.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please! I try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. Please just let it be."
Homer Simpson,"No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo Creed?"
Marge Simpson,"Please, let's just go to sleep."
Homer Simpson,"No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous?"
Marge Simpson,"No, I'm not."
Homer Simpson,"Well then, good night!"
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad. What's the word from Planet Crackpot?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me, too."
Bart Simpson,"Well, actually, Dad... I believe you."
Homer Simpson,You do?
Bart Simpson,"Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure."
Homer Simpson,"Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?"
Bart Simpson,"Hell, yes."
Homer Simpson,"That's my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!"
Bart Simpson,What if we don't?
Homer Simpson,We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.
Bart Simpson,They'll buy anything!
Homer Simpson,"Now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I kill me.
,
Frog #1,Bud...
Frog #2,...weis...
Frog #3,...er.
Frog #1,Bud...
Frog #2,...weis...
Frog #3,...er.
alligator,Coors.
Bart Simpson,"Yo, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?"
Homer Simpson,"Now, son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for Daddies, and kids with fake IDs... besides, it's such a beautiful night. How about a ghost story?"
,
Bart Simpson,And that is how much college will cost for Maggie!
Homer Simpson,No! No! No-o-o-o-o!
Bart Simpson,"You know, Dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I've really had a great time out here."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, me too."
Homer Simpson,It's him!
Alien,I bring you peace.
Homer Simpson,"As a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say..."
Homer Simpson,Bwah! Bwah! Bwaaaaah!
Homer Simpson,It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.
Bart Simpson,Oh yes we do! I got it all on tape.
Homer Simpson,"Good work, son! We did it! We did it!"
Leonard Nimoy,"And so, from this simple man came the proof that we are not alone in the universe. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Goodnight."
Stagehand,"Uh, Mr. Nimoy, we have ten minutes left."
Leonard Nimoy,"Oh. Fine. Let me just get, uh, something out of my car."
Stagehand,I don't think he's coming back.
,
Kent Brockman,Tonight on Eyewitness News: a man who's been in a coma for twenty-three years wakes up!
,
Patient,Do Sonny and Cher still have that stupid show?
Kent Brockman,"No, uh, she won an Oscar and he's a congressman."
Patient,Good night!
Kent Brockman,"But first, E.T. phone Homer -- Simpson that is!"
,
Homer Simpson,Marge! Kids! They're about to show my videotape!
Kent Brockman,Local man Homer Simpson -- shown here with his tongue stuck to a lamppost --
Kent Brockman,-- has given us this videotape. It's a Close Encounter of the Blurred Kind .
Alien,I bring you peace!
Alien,"The alien has appeared in the same Springfield pasture the past two Friday nights. Will it appear again this Friday? The entire Channel Six news team will be there. Except for Phil, the boom mic operator who's getting fired tomorrow."
Kent Brockman,"Very unprofessional, Phil."
Bart Simpson,"Well, Lis, what do you think about the alien now?"
Lisa Simpson,I think there must be a more logical explanation. And I think the people of this town aren't gonna be won over by three seconds of videotape.
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Doctor Hibbert?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Yes, is the alien carbon-based or silicon-based?"
Homer Simpson,Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.
Barney Gumble,Is the alien Santa Claus?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yes."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?"
Homer Simpson,This interview is over!
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"I remember another gentle visitor from the Heavens. He came in peace, but then died, only to come back to life. And his name was... E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. I loved that little guy."
,
Bart Simpson,Leonard Nimoy! What are you doin' here?
Leonard Nimoy,"Wherever there is mystery and the unexplained, cosmic forces shall draw me near."
Bart Simpson,Uh-huh.
Hot Dog Stand Guy,"Hey Spock, what do you want on your hot dog?"
Leonard Nimoy,Surprise me!
Homer Simpson,"Take a look at this, Lisa. You don't see any ""Homer is a Dope"" T-shirts, do you?"
T-shirt Vendor,We sold those out in five minutes.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Marge! How could you?
Marge Simpson,"These shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! And look at the fine stitching on ""Dope!"""
Homer Simpson,I'll take two!
Homer Simpson,Look! There it is!
Marge Simpson,"Oh Homie! Homie, I'm so sorry I doubted you!"
Alien,I bring you love!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now, is that the love between a man and a woman or the love of a man for a fine Cuban cigar?"
Alien,Uh... I bring you love!
Lenny Leonard,It's bringing love! Don't let it get away!
Carl Carlson,Break its legs!
Lisa Simpson,Wait!
Lisa Simpson,You want an alien? This is your alien!
C. Montgomery Burns,Hello children! I bring you love!
Bumblebee Man,Gracias.
Groundskeeper Willie,Aw. It's Mr. Burns! Kill it! Kill it!
Waylon Smithers,"No, no, let me explain... Every Friday evening after work, Mr. Burns undergoes a series of medical treatments designed to cheat death for another week..."
,
Waylon Smithers,"First, Mr. Burns' chiropractors perform a slight spinal adjustment..."
C. Montgomery Burns,
Waylon Smithers,"Then a team of doctors administers eye drops, painkillers, and a vocal cord scraping..."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Don't worry, you won't feel a thing --till I jam this down your throat!"
SMITHERS',The whole ordeal leaves Mr. Burns twisted and disoriented.
C. Montgomery Burns,La la la la la...
NICK RIVIERA,The most rewarding part was when he gave me my money.
Bart Simpson,But what's with the glowing?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, I'll field that question. A lifetime of working in a nuclear power plant has given me a healthy green glow and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and love. I bring you fear, famine, pestilence, and..."
NICK RIVIERA,Time for a booster!
C. Montgomery Burns,GOOD MORNING STAR SHINE / THE EARTH SAYS HELLO.
Leonard Nimoy,YOU TWINKLE ABOVE US / WE TWINKLE BELOW.
Crowd,GOOD MORNING STAR SHINE / YOU LEAD US ALONG...
Marge Simpson,"Well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. I'm proud of you, Homie."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Marge."
Crowd,TOOBY OOBY WOLLA / NOOBY OBBA NOBBA / EARLY MORNING SINGING SONG.
,
Stagehand,"And so concludes our tale. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Goodnight and keep watching the skis! Uh, skies."
,
Marge Simpson,
Agnes Skinner,They say the pancakes here stink.
Helen Lovejoy,"Thank you, Agnes. Let's begin. I'm happy to report that our shares in Dynaflux Unimatics are up a delicious 7 and 3/4! This means our investment club portfolio has nearly doubled in value!"
Women,
Helen Lovejoy,"I suggest we pump our profits into some new, high-risk ventures."
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, oh! How about OklaSoft? It's Oklahoma's fastest-growing software company."
Maude Flanders,Um -- cushions! Everybody likes to sit on cushions.
Agnes Skinner,Children are so fat today. Isn't there some way we could make money off that?
Helen Lovejoy,There's a Franchise Fair this weekend. Why don't we buy a business?
Women,
Marge Simpson,I'm not wild about these high-risk ventures. They sound a little risky.
Maude Flanders,"Oh, Marge, you are such a wet blanket..."
Edna Krabappel,"If we'd listened to you, we wouldn't have sponsored that Mexican wrestler!"
Agnes Skinner,Yet she still gets to share in all the profits!
Women,
Marge Simpson,"I guess I'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of ""investing""..."
Luann Van Houten,"Mmm, face it. You can't keep up with the go-go 90's."
Helen Lovejoy,"Well, Marge, you're about as popular as a rugburn! All in favor of expelling Marge from the Investorettes?"
Women,Aye!
Marge Simpson,"All right, Helen, if I'm not wanted, I'll leave."
Helen Lovejoy,You'll get your pancakes in the mail.
,
Marge Simpson,...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
Homer Simpson,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. When are the pancakes coming in the mail?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe it's all for the best..."
Homer Simpson,"What do you need to make money for anyway? As long as I have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about."
Homer Simpson,Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, this is no time to be conservative. Let's roll the dice here."
Marge Simpson,It would be nice to beat those women at their own game. Maybe I should look into a franchise.
,
Robot,"Greetings, humans. I am Investo the Robot, from the planet Opportuniac. My superior brain advises you to enter the Franchise Fair."
Marge Simpson,"Well, we're trying to, but you're blocking our way."
Robot,Danger! Danger! Don't forget to pick up pamphlets!
Bart Simpson,I'll handle this.
Robot,"Help, help. Help. Security code 30."
Motivational Man,"Well, that's the miracle of the franchise. You get all the equipment and know-how you need, plus a familiar brand name people trust. You'll be on a rocket ride to the moon. And while you're there, would you pick up some of that nice green moon money for me, Royce McCutcheon."
Homer Simpson,"No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!"
Picture Man,"Now folks, I don't want to alarm you, but scientists say 40% of America's pictures are hanging crooked."
Onlookers,
Picture Man,"Yeah, it's true. And I hear you asking, ""Well, who's going to straighten out all these artistic abominations?"" Your friends? A neighbor? Those fat-cats in Washington? Good luck. Hey, you know -- ""Maybe no one will notice. Maybe the problem will just fix itself."""
Marge Simpson,Now you're the one who's being naive.
Picture Man,"Okay, fair enough, but you sound like you're ready to become your own boss in the exciting world of frame nudging."
Picture Man,"Yes, for a minimal franchise fee, you'll receive a pair of straightening gloves, a canister of wall lubricant, and a booklet of the most commonly asked questions you will hear, including ""Who are you?"" and ""What are you doing here?"""
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I don't want to own my own business. I don't know why I came here in the first place."
Marge Simpson,"Hello, Helen."
Helen Lovejoy,Marge.
Marge Simpson,Edna.
Edna Krabappel,Marge.
Marge Simpson,Uh... oh...
Agnes Skinner,"Oh, my name is Agnes and you know it's Agnes. It means ""lamb,"" ""lamb of God!"""
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Agnes."
Agnes Skinner,Marge.
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.
Disco Stu,"Did you know that disco record sales were up 400% for the year ending 1976? If these trends continue, aaaayyyyyy..."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, your fish are dead."
Disco Stu,"Yeah, I know. I can't get them out of there."
Helen Lovejoy,"Hmm, ""pita."" Well, I don't know about food from the Middle East. Isn't that whole area a little ""iffy""?"
,
Maude Flanders,"Uh, what's ""ta-hi-ni?"""
Pita Saleswoman,Flavor sauce.
Edna Krabappel,"And ""fa-la-fel?"""
Pita Saleswoman,Crunch patties.
Helen Lovejoy,So we'd be selling foreign foo--
Pita Saleswoman,"Specialty foods. Here, try a Ben Franklin."
Helen Lovejoy,"Mmm, that is good. What's in it?"
Chef,Tabouleh and rezmi-kabob.
Pita Saleswoman,"Um, that's our chef, Christopher."
Chef,
Helen Lovejoy,I could see eating this. I really could. And I am not kidding.
Investorettes,
Marge Simpson,Look at them. They've jumped on the one franchise I might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in. I'm not cut out for the world of business.
Frank Ormand,"Oh, you sound like me. Well, the old me. Which was, ironically, the young me."
Frank Ormand,"I was once like you were, young lady, like all these people, lost in a sea of flashy gimmicks and empty promises. Then God tossed me a life preserver."
Frank Ormand,"A tasty, golden-brown life preserver. Here, try a pretzel."
Marge Simpson,Mmm... hmm... That's not bad.
Frank Ormand,"It is not only not bad, it's not bread. ""Knot bread,"" you get it, see? Heh, heh, you see?"
Marge Simpson,
Pita Saleswoman,Let's hear it for the newest members of the Fleet-A-Pita franchise!
Pita Saleswoman,Maude! Helen! Agnes! LuAnn! Edna! Bart!
Grampa Simpson,I had that dream again!
Bart Simpson,Wooo! We're number one! We're number one!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, what's going on?! Wait, wait! Hey, let go of me!..."
Marge Simpson,"Your franchise, how much?"
Frank Ormand,$500.
Marge Simpson,I'll take it!
Frank Ormand,Congratulations! And welcome to the dynamic world of mobile pretzel retailing.
Marge Simpson,When can I start? What's my territory?
Frank Ormand,"Your territory? Well, well, let me tell you. Wherever a young mother is ignorant of what to feed her baby, you'll be there. Wherever nacho penetration is less then total, you'll be there. Wherever a Bavarian is not quite full, you will be there."
Marge Simpson,Don't forget fat people. They can't stop eating!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, pretzels!"
,
Frank Ormand,"Oh, hello. I'm Frank Ormand, and if you're watching me, that means you've got pretzel fever, and not the kind that attacked my intestinal lining some years back. So let's get your franchise up and running."
Frank Ormand,Start by setting up an office in your basement or garage. An automatic garage door opener makes you feel like you're working in a futuristic wonderworld.
Frank Ormand,"Next, blanket your community with flyers. A phony ticker-tape parade will help you avoid littering laws."
Chief Wiggum,"Welcome back, Space Girl!"
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's all that commotion outside? Why, it's one of those Pretzel Wagons the movie stars are always talking about."
Lenny Leonard,Here? Our plant?
Homer Simpson,"That's right, Lenny. Let's all give in to deliciousness, the Pretzel Wagon way."
Workers,"Yeah, let's do that! / Yay! / Homer's right! / Oh, yeah!"
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, Mom, look at all those customers!"
Marge Simpson,"Hairnets, everyone."
Marge Simpson,Welcome to Pretzel Wagon. May I take your order?
Lenny Leonard,"Uh, let's see... I'll have one... Uh..."
Carl Carlson,"Hey, hurry up. I wanna get my pretzel."
Lenny Leonard,One pretzel.
Marge Simpson,Thank you.
Carl Carlson,"Let's see... Um, I will have one of your... Uh..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Come on, come on, while we're young."
Lenny Leonard,"Wow, check out that van. It looks like it doesn't even need our business."
Carl Carlson,"Hey, let's go!"
Marge Simpson,Excuse me. I had this spot first.
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, sorry, dear. Just business. Ha!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess Macy's and Gimbel's learned to live side by side."
Agnes Skinner,"Gimbel's is gone, Marge. Long gone. You're Gimbel's."
Marge Simpson,Very well. There must be dozens of great locations in this town. Don't you worry about me.
,
Cletus Spuckler,Hey! Slow down! I wants to talk to you! Give us three hundred pretzels.
Marge Simpson,You see? A little persistence and patience paid off. That'll be 300 dollars.
Cletus Spuckler,"Hey, I don't think so. I got me three hunnert coupons."
Marge Simpson,"I should've said ""limit -- one per customer."""
Cletus Spuckler,"Shoulda, but didna. So hand 'em over. Hey, kids, we're eating dinner tonight! C'mon! Tiffany! Heather! Cody! Dylan! Dermutt! Jordan! Taylor! Brittany! Wesley! Rumer! Scout! Cassidy! Zoe! Chloe! Max! Hunter! Kendall! Caitlin! Noah! Sascha! Morgan! Kyra! Ian! Lauren! Q-Bert! Phil!"
Marge Simpson,

Marge Simpson,"""Hang in there, baby."" You said it, kitty. Copyright 1968? Hmm. Determined or not, that cat must be long dead. That's kind of a downer."
Lisa Simpson,"They're good pretzels, Mom. But you've got to think big. Find a major public event and set up shop there."
,
Marge Simpson,Here you go -- free Pretzel Wagon pretzels for everyone! One bite and you'll be hooked!
Seymour Skinner,Thank you.
Homer Simpson,"That means thank you, Marge."
1st Sportscaster,"Ladies and gentlemen, a winner has been chosen for today's giveaway. And the 1997 Pontiac AstroWagon goes to the fan sitting in seat number zero zero zero one... C. Montgomery Burns!"
Entire Stadium,
2nd Sportscaster,And the fans do not like this one bit.
1st Sportscaster,And here come the pretzels!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, no! No! Don't do that! You're supposed to be tasting them!"
2nd Sportscaster,"Hall of Famer Whitey Ford now on the field, pleading with the crowd for... for some kind of sanity."
1st Sportscaster,"Uh-oh, and a barrage of pretzels now knocking Whitey unconscious."
2nd Sportscaster,"Wow, this is, uh, this is a black day for baseball."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, cheer up, Mom. You can't buy publicity like that. Thousands and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring Whitey Ford."
Homer Simpson,You could call 'em Whitey Whackers.
Marge Simpson,"I was wrong to have a dream. Wrong as usual. I mean, if you're nothing special, why kid yourself?"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Mom, no!"
Marge Simpson,"Listen to your mother, kids: aim low. Aim so low, no one will even care if you succeed."
Marge Simpson,"Dinner's in the oven. If you want some butter, it's under my face."
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can..."
,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, looks like Mr. Pretzel Man is doing pretty well for himself."
Homer Simpson,I'm here to see Mr. Ormand.
Woman,Of course. Right this way.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I guess I should speak to the executor of his estate."
Woman,He's right over there.
Woman,They were in the same car.
,
Homer Simpson,"You're my last hope. I've never reached out to you before, but my wife is in her hour of need. Your help could make all the difference in the world."
Fat Tony,Okay.
Louie,"See, Boss? I told ya that ad in the Church Bulletin would pay off."
,
Marge Simpson,"Hello? Uh, no, Pretzel Wagon's no longer -- Three hundred pretzels?! Wait, wait, let me get this down. Mmm... Mmm... Meatpackers Union Hall... Batavia, New York... I'll send them right out! Homer, Homie, wake up! Wake up, I'm back in business!"
Homer Simpson,"I had a feeling things would work out for you, honey."
Hans Moleman,Hey! What are you doing!
Fat Tony,"This is a pretzel town, pretty boy."
,
Marge Simpson,Are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these pretzels?
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, I am sure. Sure as sure can be."
Marge Simpson,"Oh my God, what happened to your fingers?!"
Mobster,Boating accident.
Seymour Skinner,I believe it was a boking accident.
Seymour Skinner,I have to go now.
,
Helen Lovejoy,I don't understand why they won't unload our falafel fixin's!
Lou,"Ship's impounded, Ma'am."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, we uh, found a couple o' barnacles on the hull. That, and uh, the deck was uh, wet."
Helen Lovejoy,That's crazy! And what are those men doing under my van?!!
Chief Wiggum,"Look, lady, if I was you, I would just leap into the air as I am preparing to do."
Chief Wiggum,
,
Moe Szyslak,"Here you go, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, Homer. You know your money's no good here."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, wait a minute -- this is real money!"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, my wife is raking it in."
,
Fat Tony,"Greetings, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?"
Fat Tony,"Uh, uh, yes. I am. Thank you for asking. Now Homer, as you no doubt recall, you were done a favor by our, uh... how shall I say, Mafia crime syndicate."
Fat Tony,"Now, the time has come for you to do us a favor."
Homer Simpson,"You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... I will say good day to you, sir."
Fat Tony,"Okay, I will go."
Fat Tony,"Hey, wait a minute."
,
Marge Simpson,"Well, here I am -- 11905 Dead Weasel Road, but I don't see any apartment building, I just --"
Marge Simpson,"Hey, what's going on?"
Fat Tony,"Is, uh, there a button or a release for these keys?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, oh, you have to push in as you turn."
Fat Tony,Oh.
Marge Simpson,"Yeah, that's it."
Marge Simpson,Who are you?
Fat Tony,"We are your business partners, and as such, we are entitled to a percentage of your profits. Something in the area of 100 per cent."
Marge Simpson,What are you talking about?
Fat Tony,We suggest you have a conversation with your husband. You have twenty-four hours to give us our money. And to show you we're serious... you have twelve hours.
Fat Tony,See you at six a.m.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, did you tell the Mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?"
Homer Simpson,In those words? Yes.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, it just sickens me. How could you do this to someone you love?"
Homer Simpson,How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, I know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the Mafia's not getting one cent of my money!"
Homer Simpson,So what are we gonna do?
Marge Simpson,We're going to do what we do every day. We're going to make pretzels.
Marge Simpson,"There, that's the last one."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank God. It's only Grampa."
Homer Simpson,Now what?
Marge Simpson,
Fat Tony,Sorry we're late. Could we have the money now?
Marge Simpson,The answer is no.
Fat Tony,"I'm afraid I must insist. You see, my wife, she has been most vocal on the subject of the pretzel monies: ""Where's the money?,"" ""When are you going to get the money?,"" ""Why aren't you getting the money now?,"" and so on. So please, the money."
Homer Simpson,"You heard her. She said ""no."""
Fat Tony,"Legs, Louie, advance on them."
Helen Lovejoy,There they are!
Edna Krabappel,"Well, well, if it isn't Marge Simpson and her gangland cronies."
Maude Flanders,Your goon squad certainly gave you the edge in the mobile snack business. But I'm afraid we've outdone you once again. Hiroshi? Yukio?
Maude Flanders,Perhaps you've heard of the Yakuza? The Poison Fists of the Pacific Rim? The Japanese Mafia?
Agnes Skinner,They'll kill you five times before you hit the ground.
Fat Tony,Take that! Take this! C'mere you little squirt.
Marge Simpson,"Homie, maybe we should go inside."
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet."
Homer Simpson,Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you know it's gonna be good!
Little Yakuza,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"You must hate me, Marge. Every time I try to help, I just fail miserably."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I don't hate you for failing. I love you for trying."
Lisa Simpson,What's going on outside?
Marge Simpson,"Oh, it's just a mob war. Go back to sleep, Honey."
Yakuza,"Forgiveness, please."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Good morning, Sir. Care for some coffee?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, the promise of a new day is more than enough exhilaration for me."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, coffee..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ah! We need some excitement around here!
Waylon Smithers,"Chinese checkers or domestic, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, something fun. Something the men will enjoy like a safety drill! But what kind?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Eh, meltdown alert? Mad dog drill? Blimp attack? Ah, I think a good old fashioned fire drill today."
Carl Carlson,"Alright, popcorn's ready!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that's the fire alarm!"
Carl Carlson,We gotta get outta here!
Lenny Leonard,"Wait for me! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
1st Panicked Employee,Get out of my way!
2nd Panicked Employee,Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
C. Montgomery Burns,Is it supposed to take this long? What's a good time for a mass evacuation of the entire plant?
Waylon Smithers,45 seconds.
C. Montgomery Burns,And what's our time so far?
Waylon Smithers,"I don't know, sir. The... this stopwatch only goes up to fifteen minutes."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Damnation! What kind of slowcoaches do I have working for me? Ah, here comes one of our fellows now."
Homer Simpson,"I think I won, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, you won all right. You won more than you bargained for."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,What a disgraceful display. I've seen more orderly behavior in a Ritz Brothers film. You all need a serious lesson in teamwork.
Carl Carlson,"Maybe he does, but I don't."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, you take that back!"
Carl Carlson,"No, you take that back!"
Homer Simpson,"Hit 'em, Carl! You too, Lenny!"
,
Homer Simpson,So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. Which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.
Bart Simpson,Teamwork is overrated.
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Bart Simpson,"Think about it. I mean, what ""team"" was Babe Ruth on? Who knows?"
Lisa Simpson,Yankees.
Waylon Smithers,Thank you. Now pair off as I draw your names. Lenny and... Carl.
Bart Simpson,Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?
Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but I think we have to go on the retreat anyway."
,
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, here we are."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right. Let me start off by telling you this will not be a walk in the park. This will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life. I cannot overemphasize the dangers which... did you bring your family, Simpson?"
Homer Simpson,Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Imbecile. Simpson, your family will have to remain here."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, kids. This is a national park. We can have lots of fun."
Ranger,"I'm afraid that's no longer true, ma'am. Budget cutbacks have forced us to eliminate anything the least bit entertaining."
Ranger,"Well, see ya."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain. The routes are treacherous, so use your maps."
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I lost my map."
Waylon Smithers,"You haven't been issued a map yet. When you arrive at the cabin, there will be a congratulatory party with sandwiches and moderately priced champagne."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now as an added incentive, the second to last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious ""World's Worst Employee"" trophy."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this sounds like fun."
C. Montgomery Burns,And the last team to arrive will be fired.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to show that I'm not playing favorites, both Smithers and I will be participating. Who knows? I might be the unlucky one who gets fired. Not bloody likely."
Waylon Smithers,I've placed all your names in this hat--
Homer Simpson,Oooh.
C. Montgomery Burns,Woooo-hoooo! / Huzzah!
Carl Carlson,"Aw, nuts-- I mean, uh... Aw, nuts."
Waylon Smithers,Fong and... Zutroy... Kimball and... Dawson... Haney and... Drucker...
Waylon Smithers,Simpson and... Burns?
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, this can't be right. You assured me this drawing was rigged so we'd be teammates."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, frankly, you've been a bit of a pill lately."
Waylon Smithers,Why do we always fight on vacation? Now there's only one name left. Whoever it is will be paired with me. And that person is... ...Waylon Smithers. Perfect. That's just perfect.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Prepare for the adventure of a lifetime as you fight for survival against the merciless forces of nature! Toe your marks, get set, go!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ready, Mr. Burns?"
C. Montgomery Burns,One moment.
,
Smokey Bear,Only who can prevent forest fires?
Smokey Bear,"You pressed ""you"", referring to me. That is incorrect. The correct answer is you."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, can Lisa and I play outside, away from the bear?"
Marge Simpson,"Okay, but when you start getting apple-cheeked, it's time to come in."
,
Waylon Smithers,"How could you do this to me, Mr. Burns? After all I've done for you. Why, if you were here, I'd kick you right in your bony old behind!"
Smithers's Echo,Bony old behind! Bony old behind! Bony old behind!
Smithers's Echo,Bony old behind!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, thank you, Simpson. I have been watching my figure."
Bart Simpson,"Lis, Lis, come here! I found two snowflakes that are exactly alike!"
Lisa Simpson,Really? Let me see!
Bart Simpson,
Waylon Smithers,
Bart Simpson,Oops. Sorry.
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Mr. Smithers!"
Waylon Smithers,"Oh great, it's the Bobbsey twins. Well, take your prying eyes elsewhere."
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, I'm sorry. It hasn't been a good day. If I don't get to the top of the mountain real soon, I could get fired."
Lisa Simpson,We'll help you.
Bart Simpson,I have a watch with a minute hand.
Waylon Smithers,All right. You can come. What time is it?
Bart Simpson,"12:80. No, wait. Wait. Wh-- what comes after twelve?"
Waylon Smithers,One.
Bart Simpson,"No, after twelve."
Waylon Smithers,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you wouldn't be averse to taking it would you?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, not as such."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Neither would I. I've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days about so-called ""cheating""."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, lotta hysteria..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Mmm-hmm. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say, cheating is the gift Man gives himself."
Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns,"And to do so, I propose we travel by..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Horseless sleigh.
Homer Simpson,"Wow. You sure know how to cheat, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, well, I'm older than you. You know, Simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met."
Homer Simpson,No sir. I am not.
,
Marge Simpson,Bart? Lisa?
Marge Simpson,Hello?
Narrator,The story of our National Parks begins in 1872. Perhaps we should let John Muir tell the tale.
John Muir,
Marge Simpson,"Excuse me, sir. I can't find my children."
Ranger,Have you checked the woods?
Marge Simpson,No.
Ranger,Hmm. Follow me.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"We made it, old friend!"
Ranger,We'll take the chair-lift. It'll give us an eagle-eye view of the area directly beneath the chair-lift.
Marge Simpson,
Ranger,"Well, I won't lie to you, ma'am. Our chances of finding your children are slim to nil."
Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Mom!"
Marge Simpson,There they are! Let me down here.
Ranger,"Uh, sorry. There's no way off 'til we get to the top, and even then it's sort of tricky."
Marge Simpson,"All right, kids. We'll meet you at the top. Just be careful!"
Ranger,"Eh, I'm actually a little more concerned about us. Um, do you know how to weld?"
,
Homer Simpson,That worked sooo well.
C. Montgomery Burns,We have several hours before the others arrive. What say we get comfy?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Now we have electricity. This propane tank will supply us with heat, and this doorknob, properly turned, will allow us access to the cabin."
Homer Simpson,No going through the window for us!
,
Bart Simpson,Is there maple syrup in this one?
Waylon Smithers,"There isn't any food in any of these trees. Please Bart, we've got to hurry. I can't be the last one to reach the cabin."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I'm not gonna get fired. Is there any gold in this mountain?"
,
Bart Simpson,I'll check.
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Smithers! Mr. Smithers! I found another hurt shrew! I think this one has a twisted ankle!
Waylon Smithers,Twisted a... Aren't there any healthy animals in this forest?
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early, Homie old boy. More champagne?"
Homer Simpson,"You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, but I'd trade it all for a little more."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, these sure are comfortable chairs."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, yes, sitting. The great leveler. From the mightiest Pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes! That's it! Oh, I could go for one of those right now!"
C. Montgomery Burns,The only hard part is getting up.
Homer Simpson,Why get up? Here's a little move I've been tinkering with. Say I want that bowl of dip.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why, you'd have to get up."
Homer Simpson,Oh?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sir, I am in your debt."
Homer Simpson,"Use it wisely, my friend."
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, did you hear something?"
Carl Carlson,No.
Lenny Leonard,Hmm. Did I?
Carl Carlson,I don't know.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Hope that wasn't an avalanche. Be a chum and have a look-see.
Homer Simpson,"You got it, buddy."
C. Montgomery Burns,Isn't there any way out of here?
Homer Simpson,"Um, I don't see one. Unless..."
Homer Simpson,No. There's no way out.
C. Montgomery Burns,"There must be some way to contact the outside world. Ah, the telegraph."
C. Montgomery Burns,S-O-S. Avalanche... Send... Help...
,
,
Carl Carlson,"According to the map, the cabin should be right here."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, maybe there is no cabin. Maybe it's one of them um, metaphorical things."
Carl Carlson,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Like maybe the ""cabin"" is the place inside each of us created by our goodwill and teamwork."
Lenny Leonard,"Ohhhh. Nah, they said there'd be sandwiches."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I have a confession. I'm not quite the tunnel digger I made myself out to be."
Homer Simpson,You can supervise me.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, good. Let's dig... That's right, dig some more... Oh, we make quite a duo: Burns and associate. No, no, what am I thinking? Burns and... teammate."
,
Homer Simpson,We sure did!
C. Montgomery Burns,
,
Homer Simpson,
,
C. Montgomery Burns,What happened?
Homer Simpson,I think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
C. Montgomery Burns,We... should... be... careful... not... to... speak... unless... it's... absolutely... positively... necessary.
Homer Simpson,Shhh! You're causing more avalanches. .
Homer Simpson,I think they've stopped. .
C. Montgomery Burns,Let's go.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Those last three avalanches were your fault, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,So what?
C. Montgomery Burns,Sew buttons.
,
Carl Carlson,"Oh, there's not another place for miles. This must be the cabin Burns was talking about."
Lenny Leonard,"Well, we made it here first, all thanks to teamwork."
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, my teamwork."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,We must be covered by a thousand feet of snow.
Homer Simpson,It could be days before they find us.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmmm... no books, no radio, no board games. Ah! A Bazooka Joe comic."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ech! I heard that one 75 years ago.
Homer Simpson,We could build snowmen.
C. Montgomery Burns,"No, I have a better idea! We could build real men. Out of snow."
Homer Simpson,Oh... Okay.
,
Lisa Simpson,Mr. Smithers! Mr. Smithers! That moose is on fire!
Waylon Smithers,Fine. Good. I don't care anymore. I'm the last one here. You kids cost me my job.
Lenny Leonard,"You ain't last, Mr. Smithers."
Waylon Smithers,"Oh, thank goodness."
Carl Carlson,Yeah. Burnsie and Homer never made it.
Waylon Smithers,Mr. Burns is still out there?
Lisa Simpson,What about our dad?!
,
Homer Simpson,"Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah. 206 bones... fifty miles of small intestine... full, pouting lips. Why, this fellow is less a snowman than a god."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, we've managed to stave off cabin fever for a few hours."
C. Montgomery Burns,I... I think we should dress the snowmen.
Homer Simpson,Agreed.
C. Montgomery Burns,Look at them. Smug and secure in their finery. Mocking us.
Homer Simpson,"Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, snowmen have peepers. Peepers to watch. To watch for our moment of weakness and then baff! comes the knock on the head and we're down."
Homer Simpson,What do we do?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, wouldn't you like to know."
,
Ranger,"Hey, what is going on here? Who are you people? This is a lookout post. Where's Ranger McFadden?"
Drunk Man,I was jush happy to see so many nice people...
Ranger,"Quiet, you drunk. Where's Ranger McFadden?"
McFadden,"Right here, sir. Right behind the drunk."
Waylon Smithers,"Wait a minute. If this is a ranger station, we must be in the wrong place."
Ranger,The only other cabin is right over there. Huh...
McFadden,Look at all these avalanches. Do you think they could've buried the cabin?
Ranger,Well I'll tell ya one thing: They didn't come here for the Mountain Music Festival. March 14-18.
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, Dad and Mr. Burns could be trapped in there!"
Marge Simpson,
,
Mr. Burns's Thoughts,"I'm trapped with a madman. Look at him, staring into me, filling my mind with paranoid thoughts."
Mr. Burns's Thoughts,"I know what he's up to! He's thinking of killing me, then riding my carcass down the mountain to safety. He's truly gone mad if he's thinking that. Well, he can't kill me if I kill him first."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'll kill you, you bloated museum of treachery."
Homer Simpson,You and what army?
C. Montgomery Burns,
Abraham Lincoln,It's showtime!
C. Montgomery Burns,Homer!
Homer Simpson,Burnsie!
,
Homer Simpson,
,
Ranger,"Okay, search party. Before we set out, let's take a moment to humor the children. Kids, your father's gonna be just fine. Okay, everybody, put on your corpse handling gloves. We've got two frozen bodies buried somewhere in this mountain."
Bart Simpson,"Did you hear that, Lis? Dad's gonna be just fine."
Lisa Simpson,Look! What's that?!!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,We'll be dashed to pieces.
Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house."
,
Waylon Smithers,It's them all right.
Marge Simpson,"We're over here, Homie!"
Lenny Leonard,"Oh, something's wrong with its brakes! Gangway!"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, kids."
Family,
C. Montgomery Burns,Have you people forgotten our little competition? Last one in the cabin is fired.
Employees,"Me first! / No, me! / Out my way! / Etc."
C. Montgomery Burns,"You're fired, Lenny."
Lenny Leonard,"Aw, nuts."
C. Montgomery Burns,So how did we do?
Waylon Smithers,"It's a new record, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Outstanding. Well, perhaps all of this has been worthwhile. Did you all learn about teamwork?"
Employees,Yes.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. In that case, no one will be fired after all."
Lenny Leonard,That old goat can't fire me. I'm going to give him a piece of my...
Lenny Leonard,
Lenny Leonard,"Aw, nuts."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Simpson, I must say, once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again."
Homer Simpson,"You said it, ya weirdo."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Announcer,It's the Krusty Komedy Klassic!
Krusty the Clown,Hey Hey! It's great to be back at the Apollo Theater and... KKK?! That's not good.
Krusty the Clown,
,
Krusty the Clown,"Now I'd like to introduce a new feature never before seen on TV... ""Dumb Pet Tricks."" Oh boy. Here's a dog that's been trained to catch this red rubber ball."
Krusty the Clown,Auggh! Oww! Somebody shoot it! Somebody shoot it!
,
Bart Simpson,These specials get worse every year.
Lisa Simpson,"I'll see what else is on. Hey, where's the remote?"
,
Grampa Simpson,Hello? Hello? Stupid cordless phone. I'll try the old-fashioned model.
Grampa Simpson,"Ah, that's better. How ya doin', Gertie?"
Krusty the Clown,"And now, our parody of ""Mad About You"" entitled ""Mad About Shoe."""
Krusty the Clown,"Gimme a kiss, baby. No tongue."
Krusty the Clown,"You're not gonna like our ""NYPD Shoe"" sketch. It's pretty much the same thing."
Bart Simpson,"Ma, could you get me some milk?"
Marge Simpson,Can't you get it yourself?
Bart Simpson,"Oh, that's okay. I'll just go without liquid."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, all right, all right, I'll get your milk!"
Bart Simpson,Thank you.
Marge Simpson,Does anyone else want anything while I'm up?
Lisa Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, get me a beer."
Marge Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, mom?"
Marge Simpson,What?!
Lisa Simpson,"Um, there's a hair in my soup. But I'll just eat around it."
Marge Simpson,What kind of hair?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's blue... six feet long..."
Bart Simpson,Ewwwwww!
Marge Simpson,It's my hair. Excuse me.
Homer Simpson,Your mother seems really upset about something. I better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.
Krusty the Clown,Now let's hear it for a great American... former president Gerald Ford.
Gerald Ford,"Thank you, Krusty for inviting me."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, all the good Presidents turned us down."
Gerald Ford,"Oh, well... I'd like to talk about a subject that is very important to me."
Gerald Ford,The Boy Scouts of America have molded men for over 100 years a-what are you...?
Krusty the Clown,"Uh, um... How's your wife Nancy?"
FORD,Betty.
Krusty the Clown,Who cares?
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge I just had a couple of beers."
Homer Simpson,Eww.
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I was just watching Women's Volleyball on ESPN..."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
Marge Simpson,All right... but don't be shocked.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, There's no way I could --"
Marge Simpson,"Homie, I'm losing my hair."
Homer Simpson,"Now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. I'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. Just like my hair!"
Marge Simpson,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Mrs. Simpson, there's no physical reason why your hair should be falling out. This thing has me buffaloed."
Nurse,"Phone call, Mrs. Simpson. Lines one and two."
Bart Simpson,"Ma, I need a glass of milk."
Lisa Simpson,Me too.
Marge Simpson,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I think the problem may be stress.
,
Marge Simpson,I was just with Dr. Hibbert. He said I was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it."
Marge Simpson,Well... I was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out.
Bart Simpson,A nanny?!
Homer Simpson,But how am I supposed to pay for that?
Lisa Simpson,We'll find a way. Mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- it's time we gave up something for her. I'll stop buying Malibu Stacey clothing.
Bart Simpson,And I'll take up smoking and give that up.
Homer Simpson,"Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar."
Lisa Simpson,But he didn't do anything!
Homer Simpson,"Didn't he Lisa? Didn't he? Hey, wait a minute, he didn't!"
Marge Simpson,"Homie, please, I never ask for much, but this is something I really need."

Homer Simpson,You're phony! Fakey phony broad!
Older Woman,

Homer Simpson,I like him!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Thanks. Hey, where do you keep the liquor?"
Homer Simpson,I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, young man, you're not what we're looking for."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"You're telling me, you blue haired witch."
Marge Simpson,I heard that!
,
Marge Simpson,I guess we're not going to find anyone.
Lisa Simpson,We have our own suggestions for the new nanny. Would you like to hear them?

Nanny,
Nanny,Whoo!
Nanny,Hello. I'm Shary Bobbins.
Homer Simpson,Did you say Mary Pop--
Nanny,"No. I definitely did not. I'm an original creation, like Rickey Rouse and Monald Muck. Now, as your nanny, I'll do everything from telling stories to changing diapers."
Grampa Simpson,Put me down for one of each.
,
Homer Simpson,"Now Ms. Bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. First, do you have any bad habits?"
SHARY,"No, I'm practically perfect in every way."
Homer Simpson,"Well, so am I."
Homer Simpson,Okay. Question two -- who was your last employer?
SHARY,Lord and Lady Huffington of Sussex.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do we know them?"
Marge Simpson,No.
Homer Simpson,Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The black guy?
Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?"
Bart Simpson,I have a question.
Bart Simpson,"Pop quiz, hotshot. I'm s'posed to be doing my homework, but you find me upstairs reading a Playdude. What do you do? What do you do?"
SHARY,"I make you read every article in that magazine, including Norman Mailer's latest claptrap about his waning libido."
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, she is tough."
Marge Simpson,"Shary Bobbins, you're just what we're looking for."
SHARY,"Very well. Come along, children."
Marge Simpson,"My, she seems too good to be true."
Homer Simpson,I'll say. Her butt waxed the banister.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I can see myself!"
,
SHARY,"All right children, let's clean up this room."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, man."
Lisa Simpson,Do we have to?
SHARY,"Now, now, I know a little secret that will make the job go twice as fast."
SHARY,"IF THERE'S A TASK THAT MUST BE DONE / DON'T TURN YOUR TAIL AND RUN / DON'T POUT, DON'T SOB / JUST DO A HALF-ASSED JOB --"
SHARY,"IF YOU CUT EVERY CORNER IT IS REALLY NOT SO BAD / EVERYBODY DOES IT, EVEN MOM AND DAD /"
SHARY,"IF NOBODY SEES IT, THEN NOBODY GETS MAD."

SHARY,"Hello, Willie."
Lisa Simpson,You know her?
Groundskeeper Willie,"Aye, Shary Bobbins and I were engaged to be wed back in the old country. Then she got her eyesight back. Suddenly the Ugliest Man in Glasgow wasn't good enough for her."
SHARY,"It's good to see you, Willie."
Groundskeeper Willie,That's not what you said the first time you saw me!
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Extra! Extra! Ripper strikes in White Chapel!

Lisa Simpson,"Oh Shary Bobbins, this is ever so much fun!"
Bart Simpson,"With you, every day is Guy Fawkes Day!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Bah humbug.
SHARY,"Oh, Mr. Burns, I think you'll find all life's problems just float away when you're flying a kite."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Balderdash. This is the silliest load of... Ooh, look at it fly. Whee! Look at me, Smithers, I feel practically superduperfragicaliexpiala-dohhhh!"

Marge Simpson,"That Shary Bobbins is a miracle worker. The kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. It's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!"
Homer Simpson,"Come to bed, Marge."
Marge Simpson,Ooooh.
Homer Simpson,"No, no. Leave it in."
,
,
SHARY,"It's eight o'clock, children. Time for bed."
Lisa Simpson,But we're not sleepy.
Bart Simpson,"Sing us a song, Shary Bobbins."
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, sing us a song!"
SHARY,"I've been singing you songs all day. I'm not a bloody jukebox! Oh, all right."
SHARY,"IN FRONT OF A TAVERN, FLAT ON HIS FACE / A BOOZEHOUND NAMED BARNEY IS PLEADING HIS CASE --"
Barney Gumble,"BUY ME A BEER, TWO BUCKS A GLASS / COME ON, HELP ME -- I'M FREEZING MY ASS / BUY ME BRANDY / A SNIFTER OF WINE / WHO AM I KIDDING? / I'LL DRINK TURPENTINE."

SHARY,
Host,"Welcome back to ""Before They Were Famous."" We all know Rainier Wolfcastle as the star of the blockbuster ""McBain"" movies. But here's his first appearance -- in a commercial in his native Austria."
Homer Simpson,Shary Bobbins! I want another beer!
SHARY,"Well you know, Homer -- IF THERE'S A JOB THAT MUST BE DONE / YOU'LL FIND IT'S MUCH MORE FUN."
Homer Simpson,You'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
SHARY,BUT THE BEER WILL TASTE MORE SWEET / IF YOU GET UP OFF YOUR SEAT --
Bart Simpson,"Lady, the man asked for a beer, not a song."
SHARY,Doh-re-mi-fa-so...
Host,"Now let's take a look at a young Charles Bronson's brief stint replacing Andy Griffith in ""The Andy Griffith Show."""
Fidgety Lieutenant,Where's Otis? He's not in his cell.
Charles Bronson,I shot him.
Fidgety Lieutenant,"Well, that's... What?"
Charles Bronson,Now I'm going down to Emmett's Fix-It Shop. To fix Emmett.

SHARY,"Bart Simpson, this room is a frightful mess."
Bart Simpson,I'll get right on it.

Bart Simpson,"I've got a better game. It's called ""Whippin' Cupcakes."""

Quentin Tarantino,"What I'm trying to say in this cartoon is that violence is everywhere in our society, you know, it's like even in breakfast cereals, man..."
Lisa Simpson,
SHARY,"Lisa, don't sit in front of that telly like a fly stuck on a toffee. It's a great big world out there."
Lisa Simpson,Been there. Done it.
SHARY,I know -- we could have a tea party on the ceiling!
Lisa Simpson,Shh. TV.

SHARY,WASTED AWAY AGAIN IN MARGARITAVILLE...
Barney Gumble,"SEARCHING FOR MY LOST SHAKER OF SALT... OH, HERE IT IS."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that poor woman."
Lisa Simpson,We've crushed her gentle spirit.
Bart Simpson,You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
Marge Simpson,"Shary, you did the best you could. But you can't change this family. Neither can I. From now on I'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the ride."
SHARY,But haven't I taught you people anything?
Homer Simpson,Nope.
Lisa Simpson,Nope.
Bart Simpson,Nope.
Marge Simpson,Nope.
SHARY,So you like it this way?
Homer Simpson,Indubitably!
Homer Simpson,"AROUND THE HOUSE, I NEVER LIFT A FINGER / AS A HUSBAND AND FATHER I'M SUB-PAR / I'D RATHER DRINK A BEER THAN WIN FATHER OF THE YEAR / I'M HAPPY WITH THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE."
Lisa Simpson,I'M GETTING USED TO NEVER GETTING NOTICED.
Bart Simpson,I'M STUCK HERE TILL I CAN STEAL A CAR.
Marge Simpson,THE HOUSE IS STILL A MESS AND I'M GOING BALD FROM STRESS --
Marge Simpson,BUT WE'RE HAPPY JUST THE WAY WE ARE!

Krusty the Clown,"I hope you enjoyed my one-man pie fight, kids! Now it's time for another fanshmabulous episode of Itchy and Scratchy!"
Itchy,
Scratchy,
Scratchy,
,
Marge Simpson,Kids? Kids?
Marge Simpson,You're missing the Itchy and Scratchy Show! Don't you like it anymore?
Lisa Simpson,"Sure, we love it! But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows we don't need to see you every day."
Marge Simpson,An occasional hug is all I ask.
Bart Simpson,"Mo-om, you can hug me when I'm asleep."
Marge Simpson,I do.
Bart Simpson,
,
Krusty the Clown,
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Hey, Krusty, you look great! Ya get your teeth bleached?"
Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, it's a new kind of polymer treatment-- Hey, shut up! You're here 'cause your Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are stinkin' up my ratings. Look at this breakdown of yesterday's show."
Krusty the Clown,Kaboom!
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",What happened here? Lightning hit the transmitter?
Krusty the Clown,"See, that's what I thought at first, but then-- Hey, shut up! That crater is where your lousy cartoon crash-landed! It's ratings poison."
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",But Itchy and Scratchy is critically acclaimed-
Krusty the Clown,"Acclaimed? I oughtta replace it right now with that Chinese cartoon where the robots turn into, blingwads. But I'm a lazy, lazy man, Roger...So I'll give you one more chance. Now get out! Don't come back 'til you've fixed Itchy and Scratchy!"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",
Miss Lois Pennycandy,"Okay, Mel, you can go in now."
Sideshow Mel,"Krusty, I've come to solicit donations for the Rock and Roll Museum-- I'll come back later."
,
Marge Simpson,I need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department.
Bart Simpson,Can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?
Marge Simpson,Mmm... okay. Just be careful.
Man,Would you kids like to come with me?
Lisa Simpson,Ok. / Guess so. / Sounds good to me./ Let's go.
,
,
Moderator,"Hi. Thanks for participating in our focus group, kids. Today, we're going to show you some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons."
Lisa Simpson,Wow! / Alright! / Cool!
Moderator,"We want you to tell us what you think -- and be honest, because no one from the show is here spying on you."
Lisa Simpson,Why is that mirror sneezing?
Moderator,"Uh, look, it's just an old, creaky mirror. Y'know, sometimes it sounds a little like it's sneezing or coughing or talking softly."
Moderator,"Now you each have a knob in front of you. When you like what you see, turn the knob to the right."
Moderator,"When you don't like what you see, turn it left."
,
Moderator,Please refrain from tasting the knob.
Lisa Simpson,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, quit it!"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",They like Itchy. They like Scratchy. One kid seems to love the speedo man. What more do they want?
Moderator,"Okay. How many of you kids would like Itchy and Scratchy to deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day?"
Lisa Simpson,Me! / I would! /
Moderator,"And who would like to see them do just the opposite, getting into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers?"
Lisa Simpson,Me! / I would! /
Moderator,"So you want a realistic, down-to-earth show that's completely off-the-wall and swarming with magic robots."
Lisa Simpson,
Milhouse Van Houten,And also you should win things by watching.
Moderator,
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",You kids don't know what you want! That's why you're still kids -- 'cause you're stupid. Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show!
Ralph Wiggum,Mommy!
Lisa Simpson,"Um, excuse me, sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy and Scratchy show -- it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","That's it. That's it, little girl!! You've saved Itchy and Scratchy!"
Executive,I feel we should rasta-fy him by ten percent or so.
Blue-Haired Lawyer,Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save Itchy and Scratchy.
,
,
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","I have figured out how to rejuvenate the show. It is so simple, you egghead writers woulda never thought of it. What we need is... a new character! One that today's kids can relate to!"
Writer #1,"Are you absolutely sure that's wise, sir? I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here, but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, this ain't art, it's business! What do you got in mind -- sexy broad? Gangster octopus?"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","No, no. The animal chain of command goes mouse, cat... DOG. D-O-G."
Writer #2,A dog? Isn't that a tad predictable?
Executive,In your dreams. We're talking the original dog from hell.
Writer #1,You mean Cerberus?
,
Krusty the Clown,"So he's proactive, huh?"
Executive,"Oh God, yes. We're talking about a totally outrageous paradigm."
Writer #3,"Excuse me, but ""proactive"" and ""paradigm"" -- aren't these just buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important? Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that. I'm fired, aren't I?"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Oh, yes. The rest of you writers start thinking up a name for this funky dog. I don't know, something along the lines of, say... Poochie. Only more proactive."
Krusty the Clown,Yeah.
Writer #1,"So, Poochie okay with everybody?"
Writing Staff,"Yeah / Whatever / You know, it's good /"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","No, no, no. He was supposed to have attitude."
Head Animator,"Um, wh-wh-what do you mean, exactly?"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Oh, you know, attitude, attitude! Sunglasses."
Executive,Can we put him in more of a hip-hop context?
Krusty the Clown,Forget context. He's gotta be a surfer. Gimme a nice shmear of surfer.
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Mmm, I think he needs a little more attitude."
Executive,
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",I love it!
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.
Roy,"Yo yo! How's it hangin', everybody?"
Marge Simpson,"'Morning, Roy!"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, they're having open casting for the voice of Poochie."
Lisa Simpson,"You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice."
Homer Simpson,I do not!
Bart Simpson,Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
Homer Simpson,I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
Bart Simpson,"Well, here. Say something."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin' ""Howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin'-- I don't sound like that, do I? Oh, I don't like having such a hilarious voice."
Bart Simpson,That hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom.
,
Otto Mann,"Whoa, a talking dog! What were you guys smoking when you came up with that?"
David Cohen,"We were eating rotisserie chicken. Can you just read the line, please?"
Otto Mann,"""Ruff, Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog!"""
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","You're perfect! In fact, you're better than perfect! Next to you, perfection is crap."
Troy McClure,"""Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog!"" Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such cartoons as ""Christmas Ape"" and ""Christmas Ape Goes to Summer Camp."""
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",You're even better than this guy!
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Take a hike, you bum!"
Otto Mann,
Homer Simpson,Ruff Ruff! I'm Poochie the rockin' dog.
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Now that's just bad. You got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, ""no attitude,"" eh? Not ""in-your-face,"" huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, Ugly!"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",That's it! That's the Poochie attitude!! Do that again!
Homer Simpson,Huh? I can't. I don't remember what I did.
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Then you don't get the job. Next!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog."
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",That's it! You've got the job!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, now I got the job, huh? Oh. Thank you."
Sound Engineer,"Okay, Homer. Let's get a level check on your voice."
Homer Simpson,"She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again."
June,"Relax, Homer, you'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy."
Homer Simpson,You? But you're a lady.
June,"She's a lady, all right. A beauuutiful lady."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?"
June,"Oh, just experience, I suppose. I started out as Road Runner -- ""Meep!"""
Homer Simpson,"You mean ""meep meep""?"
June,"No, they only paid me to say it once,"
June,then they doubled it up on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards.
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",You folks ready to begin?
Homer Simpson,"Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?"
June,"No, Homer. Very few cartoons are broadcast live -- it's a terrible strain on the animators' wrists."
,
,
Nerd #1,"Hi. Question for Miss Bellamy: In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe that this is some sort of magic xylophone or something? Boy, I really hope someone got fired for that blunder."
June,Uh... Er...
Scratchy,What's that name again? I forgot.
,
Homer Simpson,"I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""Genius At Work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
Nerd #1,I withdraw my question.
Database,"Uh, excuse me, Mr. Simpson. On the Itchy and Scratchy CD-Rom, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?"
Homer Simpson,What the hell are you talking about?
June,"You're a lifesaver, Homer. I can't deal with these hardcore fans."
Comic Book Guy,Your attention please.
Nerd In Audience,In episode...
Comic Book Guy,"Your attention, please! Mr. Simpson will now be autographing 8-by-10 glossies of Poochie. One per customer. Please form a line. There will be no cutting. I'm talking to you, Mr. Cutter."
Comic Book Guy,"Pardon me, look out, pardon me, excuse me, hot soup. Hi. Kindly make one out to me and three out to my friend of the same name."
,
Marge Simpson,I'm so glad you could join us for Homer's big premiere.
Jasper Beardly,"Is this seat taken, little girl?"
Bart Simpson,I'm not a girl! Are you blind?
Jasper Beardly,Yes.
Roy,"I am stoked, Mr. ""S."""
Marge Simpson,Shush everybody! It's coming on!
Krusty the Clown,"Once in a great while, we are privileged to experience a television event so extraordinary, it becomes part of our shared heritage. 1969: Man walks on the moon."
Krusty the Clown,1971: Man walks on the moon again.
Krusty the Clown,"Then for a long time, nothing happened. Until tonight. Behold the future of comedy: Poochie!"
Kids In Audience,
Theme Singers,They fight and bite
Very Deep Voice,And bark!
Theme Singers,They fight and bite and fight
Very Deep Voice,And bark!
Theme Singers,Fight bite bark!
Very Deep Voice,Woof woof woof!
Theme Singers,The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show!
Itchy,"Look, Scratchy! It's our new friend, Poochie!"
Poochie,The name's Poochie D. / And I rock the telly / I'm half Joe Camel and a third Fonzarelli / I'm the Kung-Fu hippie / From gangsta city / I'm a rappin' surfer / You the fool I pity.
Scratchy,Fool! Poochie is one outrageous dude!
Itchy,He's totally in my face!
Poochie,"Wiggity-wiggity word up! Rock on, party!"
Milhouse Van Houten,When are they going to get to the fireworks factory?
Moe Szyslak,"Can somebody tell me what the hell is goin' on? Midge, help me out here."
Homer Simpson,Quiet! You're missing the jokes!
Poochie,"Catch you on the flip side, dudemeisters! Not."
Poochie,Hey kids -- always recycle... TO THE EXTREME! Bust it!
Nelson Muntz,"Eh, that stunk!"
Homer Simpson,Well? What did everybody think?
Crowd,/
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of Impy and Chimpy I've ever seen."
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer. You, uh... you got a beautiful home here."
Homer Simpson,"So it was pretty okay, huh?"
Bart Simpson,"Mom, can we go to bed without dinner?"
Marge Simpson,Yes we can!
Homer Simpson,"Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I?"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,I'm the worst Poochie ever.
Lisa Simpson,"No, it's not your fault, dad. You did fine. It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords."
Bart Simpson,"Don't have a cow, Lis."
Marge Simpson,Bart's right -- let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.
,
Comic Book Guy,"Last night's Itchy and Scratchy was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever. Rest assured that I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?"
Comic Book Guy,"As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me."
Bart Simpson,What? They've given you thousands of
Bart Simpson,"hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them."
,
Kent Brockman,"It looks like the beginning of the end for the venerable Itchy and Scratchy program. For years, TV critics such as yours truly, Kent Brockman, have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show's hilarious facade. Yesterday, our prayers were finally answered when Poochie the Dog made his howlingly unfunny debut. Far be it from me to gloat at another's downfall, but I have a feeling no children are going to be crying when this puppy is put to sleep."
,
Krusty the Clown,What the hell happened?!
Executive,"Well, I'd attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our key demographic, coupled with the overall crumminess of Poochie."
Krusty the Clown,"Whoa, you gotta stop this thing! Please, I'm gettin' egged on the street! Do something! DO SOMETHING!!"
Krusty the Clown,"Uh, hi, Mr. Myers. I've been doing some thinking and I've got some ideas to improve the show. I got it right here Uh, one: Poochie needs to be louder, angrier and have access to a time machine. Two: Whenever Poochie's not on screen, all the other characters should be asking ""Where's Poochie?"" Three--"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Great, great. Just leave them right there on the floor on your way out."
,
Homer Simpson,
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Listen guys, we gotta do something about Poochie."
Krusty the Clown,There's only one thing we can do.
Krusty the Clown,
,
Homer Simpson,Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!
Bart Simpson,"Really?! Oh, how terrible!"
Lisa Simpson,Yes. Terrible.
Marge Simpson,"It's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers. They make me madder than a, um... yak in heat!"
Poochie,I have to go now. My planet needs me.
,
Homer Simpson,"You're right, Marge! It's not my fault! I'm not gonna let 'em treat Poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!"
Roy,"Right on, Mr. S.!"
Homer Simpson,"Put a sock in it, Roy."
,
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Okay, so here's where Itchy lunges at Poochie with a rusty chain saw... Cue sound effects!"
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",Rustier!
June,"Are you prepared to die, Poochie?"
Homer Simpson,No I am not.
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Oh, cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Just stick to the script as written, Homer. You're supposed to say ""Please, cut off my head, I don't deserve to live."""
Homer Simpson,Never!
Homer Simpson,"You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands."
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Forget it, Homer! We can do the show without you if we have to."
June,But not without me!
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","Aw, geez..."
June,Let him try the new lines.
"Roger Meyers, Jr.","All right, all right. We'll try it. Action."
June,"Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say. Do you?"
Homer Simpson,"Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
"Roger Meyers, Jr.",And... cut!
,
Homer Simpson,"Now, kids -- I know you loved the old Poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten Superbowls. I don't want to oversell it. Judge for yourselves."
Scratchy,"Well, look who's here!"
Itchy,"Hi, Poochie! You look like you've got something to say. Do you?"
Poochie,Yes. I certainly do.
Marge Simpson,So?
Bart Simpson,Wow -- Poochie came from another planet?
Lisa Simpson,I guess...
Homer Simpson,"Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! Those finks double-crossed me!"
Krusty the Clown,Poochie's dead!
Kids In Audience,
Krusty the Clown,"Now, kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die, they're back again the very next week. That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit that Poochie will never, ever, ever return."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,This document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes.
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Tough break, dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie. Maybe in a few years."
Roy,"Good news, everybody! I'm moving into my own apartment with two sexy ladies."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, then I guess this is goodbye, Roy. Maybe we'll see you in a few years..."
Roy,
Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live and learn."
Bart Simpson,It's back to the basics. Classic Itchy and Scratchy!
Lisa Simpson,We should thank our lucky stars they're still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years.
Bart Simpson,What else is on?
,
Bart Simpson,"All right, everybody got their ticket? Then get ready for today's Super-Barto jackpot drawing!"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Come on, cantaloupe!"
Bart Simpson,Aannd 'round and 'round she -- uh-oh.
Kids,
Kids,
Bart Simpson,No refunds! Force majeure! Read the back of your ticket!
Homer Simpson,"Nine hundred dollars? Well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again."
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, nuts. Hel-lo? China? Little help?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I never thought it would come to this, but I guess we'll have to sell Grandma's Civil War doll."
Lisa Simpson,"Aw, Mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill? I mean, what would your Grandma say?"
Marge Simpson,"I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear."
Homer Simpson,That is so true.
,
,
Seymour Skinner,"Hmmm. These campaign buttons are all partisan. Don't you have any neutral ones? ""May The Better Man Win?""... ""Let's Have a Good, Clean Election?"" That sort of thing?"
Hip Saleswoman,"Uh, no, but we do have some old shirt buttons. They're kind of kooky and fun."
Seymour Skinner,"Missy, you just talked yourself right out of a sale."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis, check it out! Pogo Stilts! These were banned in all 50 states!"
Homer Simpson,What happened?
Lisa Simpson,"Wow! An actual robot from the movie ""Clank! Clank! You're Dead!"""
Lisa Simpson,Ech! Think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...
Bart Simpson,"Aw, boo hoo. That's what they get paid for."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, look! Look! A TV Guide owned by Jackie O.!"
John,"Oh, you should see the crossword puzzle! She thought that ""Mindy"" lived with ""Mark!"""
Homer Simpson,Give her a break! Her husband was killed!
John,"Oh, I know! Wasn't that awful? Hi, I'm John. Can I help you with anything?"
Marge Simpson,"Yes, I have something that I'd like to sell."
John,Please tell me it's your hair.
,
Lisa Simpson,Please don't construe our ownership of this as an endorsement of slavery.
John,"Hmm. Well, see... he--here's the thing on this. It's a Johnny Reb bottle, early 1970's. One of the J&R Whiskey ""Liquor Lads."" Two books of Green Stamps, if I'm not mistaken."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. No. It's a very, very old figurine."
John,"No, it's-- it's a liquor bottle. See?"
John,Ahhh. That'll make your Bull Run.
,
Foreman,"We work hard, we play hard!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!"
Homer Simpson,Fifty bucks for a toy? No kid is worth that.
John,"Oh, but this is the Rex Mars Atomic Discombobulator! Don't you just love the graphics on this box?"
Homer Simpson,"No. How can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? You're a grown man."
John,It's camp! The tragically ludicrous? The ludicrously tragic?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. Like when a clown dies."
John,"Well, sort of... But I mean more like inflatable furniture or ""Last Supper"" TV trays or even this bowling shirt. Can you believe someone gave this to Goodwill?"
Homer Simpson,And that kind of stuff is worth money?
John,Boy howdy!
Homer Simpson,"Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!"
John,"Well, if you're inviting me over --"
Homer Simpson,"I practically insist. Shall we say, 5 o'clock? The snacking hour?"
John,My heart is palpitating.
,
Marge Simpson,...pimento nose... and voila! Mommy's patented Happy-Cracker Snack Platter!
John,"Ding Dong! Classic! I mean -- that says it all, doesn't it?"
John,"Oh, man, you weren't kiddin' about this place! Well, I just love it!"
Homer Simpson,Do I know you?
John,"Oh! The color scheme. And the rabbit ears. And the two point three children... I mean, where's the Hi-C?"
Lisa Simpson,Hi-C! And Fluffernutters!
John,"Oh, and pearls on a little girl? It's a fairy tale!"
John,"Oh, I've got the exact same curtains, only in my bathroom. Didn't you just die when you found these?"
Marge Simpson,Not really. They just had corn on them. Kitchen -- corn.
John,Oh!...
Homer Simpson,Ow! Why you little...
Bart Simpson,Dad! Dad! Company! Company!
Homer Simpson,"Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"So, do those records have ""camp value?"""
John,"Everything here does. You yourself are worth a bundle, Homer. Why, I could wrap a bow around you and slap on a price tag!"
John,"C'mon, Homer! Join the party!"
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, John likes ""Itchy and Scratchy"" as much as we do -- maybe more!"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, and he collects toy robots!"
Marge Simpson,He is quite a charmer. Your father's certainly taken a shine to him...
John,"Oof! Homer, you are the living end!"
Homer Simpson,That John is the greatest guy in the world. We've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
Marge Simpson,"Mmm, I don't think he's married, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there..."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, didn't John seem a little... festive to you?"
Homer Simpson,Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
Marge Simpson,He prefers the company of men!
Homer Simpson,Who doesn't?
Marge Simpson,"Homer, listen carefully: John is a ho-mo--"
Homer Simpson,Right...
Marge Simpson,... sexual.
,
Homer Simpson,"OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced with a Gay! Marge, Lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. Promise me!"
Marge Simpson,You're being ridiculous.
Homer Simpson,"Am I, Marge? Am I? Think of the property values! Now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!"
Marge Simpson,"I'm very sorry you feel that way. Because John invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going."
Homer Simpson,"Whoa, not me. And not because John's gay, but because he's a sneak. He should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way."
Marge Simpson,What on earth are you talking about?
Homer Simpson,"You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming."
John,Zzzzapp!
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, at least come out and say hello."
Homer Simpson,"No! No, no, no, no..."
Marge Simpson,Come on. You liked John this morning.
Homer Simpson,"No, no! I'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, Dad, you are the living end."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, where'd that cool creepy Santa come from?"
John,"Japan. Except over there, they call him ""Annual Gift-Man,"" and he lives on the moon!"
John,"They DRIVE off. Homer, in the window, gawks at the scene."
,
John,...And that's where Kent Brockman was caught cheating in the Springfield Marathon...
Bart Simpson,
John,...And there's where Lupe Velez bought the toilet she drowned in...
Bart Simpson,
,
Bart Simpson,"That was a killer tour, man."
Lisa Simpson,I never realized how many celebrities humiliated themselves right in our own backyard!
John,"This is a sordid little burg, isn't it? Makes me sick in a wonderful, wonderful way."
Waylon Smithers,John!
John,Uh... Waylon! I'd like you to meet the Simpsons.
Waylon Smithers,"I know the Simpsons. So this is your ""sick mother?"""
Waylon Smithers,"Don't do this to me, Waylon!"
,
Homer Simpson,"How'd it go? Tell me everything that happened! He didn't give you Gay, did he? Did he?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, geez Louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. John's a witty, urbane person."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, and I'm not."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, look what I got! Zzzapp!! Zzzapp! Zzzapp! Zzzapp!"
Homer Simpson,Bart! Where'd you get that shirt?
Bart Simpson,I'unno. Came outta the closet.
Homer Simpson,Uhh... huh.
Marge Simpson,"I hope you all saved room, because I made your favorite dessert: store-bought snack cakes! Both kinds!"
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homie, I can hear you chewing on your pillow. What's wrong?"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt!"
Homer Simpson,"There's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me."
Marge Simpson,"So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
Homer Simpson,"Right. Thank you. I hope you realize this is all your fault. I mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't think there's a problem with Bart. But if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. Goodnight."
,
Bart Simpson,"Gonna what, Homer?"
John,"... And Helen Lovejoy -- sure she looks blonde, but I've heard cuffs and collar don't match, if you get my drift..."
Marge Simpson,"I don't, but I loved hearing it!"
Homer Simpson,You! I should have known!
John,"Well, good morning, Sunshine."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, John brought us cactus candy!"
Homer Simpson,"Look, John, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. Just stay the hell away from my family!"
John,"Well, now you don't get any candy. No, that's cruel. Take a teensy piece."
Homer Simpson,No.
John,"Homer, what have you got against gays?"
Homer Simpson,"You know. It's... it's not... usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, please. You're embarrassing yourself."
Homer Simpson,"No I'm not, Marge! They're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned the Navy into a floating joke! They ruined all our best names, like Bruce and Lance and Julian! Those were the toughest names we had, now they're just..."
John,Queer?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah! And that's another thing! I resent ""you people"" using that word. That's our word for making fun of you. We need it! Well, I'm taking back our word and I'm taking back my son!"
Homer Simpson,Homer storms out.
,
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, boy. We're gonna set you straight. By tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular Burt Reynolds."
Bart Simpson,"What are you talking about, Homer? Where are we going?"
Homer Simpson,Just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. Father and son.
Homer Simpson,"Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you."
Homer Simpson,... as a father! A father!! A regular father!! Whooh!
,
Bart Simpson,What am I supposed to do here?
Homer Simpson,Nothing. Just sit. I'll be back.
Homer Simpson,Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?
Bart Simpson,I'unno. I kinda want a cigarette.
Homer Simpson,That's a good start. Let's get you a pack. What's your brand?
Bart Simpson,Anything slim!
Homer Simpson,"Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will..."
,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"
Foreman,Roscoe.
Homer Simpson,Roscoe here runs this mill. He's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin' what they do best.
Bart Simpson,Why the hell would I want to see that?
Homer Simpson,You'll thank me on your wedding night.
Foreman,"Hey, listen up! I want all of youse to say hello to the Simpsons!"
100 Workers,Hel-lo!!
Homer Simpson,Has the whole world gone insane?
Worker,"Stand still, there's a spark in your hair!"
Worker #2,"Get it, get it, get it...!"
Buffed Worker,"Hot stuff, comin' through!"
Homer Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know! This is a nightmare! You're all sick!
Worker In Crowd,"Oh, be nice."
Homer Simpson,"Ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! The whole world's gone gay!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God, what's happening now?"
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,...and the entire steel mill was gay!
Moe Szyslak,"Where ya been, Homer? Entire steel industry's gay."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, aerospace, too. And the railroads. And ya know what else? Broadway!"
Barney Gumble,I always hoped Bart'd grow up to be just like us. What happened?
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast."
Homer Simpson,But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!
Moe Szyslak,"Well, lessee now... uh, time was, you'd send a boy off to war. Shootin' a man'd fix him right up. But there's not even any wars no more thank you very much Warren Christopher!"
Barney Gumble,"Hey, better yet, Bart could shoot a deer. That's like shooting a beautiful man!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, he's right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!"
Homer Simpson,"Hunting, eh?"
,
Homer Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Stand aside, Marge. I'm taking the boy deer hunting. He's going to grow up straight for once."
Marge Simpson,"What? You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!"
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah?! How long since you've had a baby?
Lisa Simpson,"But, Dad, it's barbaric! How does killing a deer make you more of a man?"
Homer Simpson,It just does! Name me one gay Indian!
John,"Uh-oh, something's gonna die!"
Homer Simpson,"Butt out, butt-insky! What would you know about hunting?"
John,"I know this much: I wouldn't wear that hideous hat. Here, take this one -- it was worn by Yale Summers in ""Daktari."""
Homer Simpson,"Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!"
,
Barney Gumble,"Today you're gonna be a man, Bart!"
Bart Simpson,You guys gonna teach me to drive?
Sideshow Bob,"Yes. I'm a good, good man."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, yeah, let a twinkle-toes drive Betsy. Right."
Homer Simpson,"No, boy. You can't drive, you're only 10. You're going hunting!"
Moe Szyslak,"Y'ever been huntin' before there, Barty?"
Bart Simpson,Nope. Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
Homer Simpson,"That is a very immature attitude, young man."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Remember, guys, the truck only holds six carcasses, so don't shoot nothin' but trophy bucks, huh?"
Barney Gumble,"Aw, we shoulda just stayed at the bar and shot some rats."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, those ain't your rats, Barn. Well, Homer, you ready to call it quits?"
Homer Simpson,Well... but... Wait a minute. Bart's not fixed yet! He hasn't even --
Moe Szyslak,Homer...
Homer Simpson,
,
Moe Szyslak,"C'mon, don't take it so hard, Homer. You still got that other kid... uh, Lisa. Let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian."
Moe Szyslak,"...Aw, geez, Homer! Geez! You and Marge ain't cousins, are ya?"
Homer Simpson,No... This whole thing is my fault. I've been a lousy dad.
Moe Szyslak,"Cheer up, Homer. Christmas is comin' early this year!"
,
,
John,Did he say where they were going?
Lisa Simpson,No. They were just going to find a deer and make Bart shoot it.
John,Deer? Not around here. They all migrated north when the state park converted to AstroTurf.
Lisa Simpson,"But if there're no deer out there, then what are they hunting?"
John,"Well, the only thing around here that's even close to deer is...."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!"
Bart Simpson,"Huh? You did? Wait, man, those are reindeer."
Homer Simpson,"Yep, and it's your shot, son."
Lisa Simpson,Where are the dice?
Bart Simpson,What? I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?"
Bart Simpson,Da-ad --
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, criminy! Here come the waterworks."
Homer Simpson,"Bart, I'm gonna turn my back -- and when I turn around, I wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer."
Homer Simpson,"Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!"
Bart Simpson,I didn't do anything.
Barney Gumble,They're goin' nuts! Like in those nature films!
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, it must be matin' season!"
Barney Gumble,
Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'm scared."
Homer Simpson,"Me too, son."
Bart Simpson,"No, don't! You have to protect yourself!"
Homer Simpson,"Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!"
Homer Simpson,UNNGHH!!
Bart Simpson,"Dad, are you hurt?"
Homer Simpson,Just... my bones... and organs...
Homer Simpson,
Mechanical Voice,Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.
Homer Simpson,What the -- ?
Homer Simpson,"Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!"
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, it's Santa, all right! And he is kickin' ass!"
Homer Simpson,It's a miracle!
John,"No, Ultrasuede is a miracle. This is just good timing."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe! Hmmm, you feel softer than before."
Homer Simpson,I've been tenderized.
Bart Simpson,How'd you know that thing would work?
John,"Well, the sound is just brutal. And I figured reindeer would naturally be afraid of their cruel master, Santa Claus. I mean, wouldn't you be?"
Barney Gumble,"Is it okay to come out now, Mr. Gay Man, sir?"
Moe Szyslak,I'll do anything you say! Anything!
Barney Gumble,"Aw, Moe, we were saved by a sissy."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, we'll never live it down. Oh, boy, it looks like it's suicide again for me."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Stop, you idiots!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?"
John,"Well, that, or John."
Lisa Simpson,"This is about as tolerant as Dad gets, so you should be flattered."
John,"Great! Well, Homer, I won your respect, and all I had to do was save your life. Now if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set."
Homer Simpson,Amen to that.
,
Homer Simpson,"Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Lisa Simpson,He thinks you're gay.
Bart Simpson,He thinks I'm gay?

TV Announcer,"Live! From Springfield Penitentiary's fabulous Big Open Area in Cell Block ""D""! It's the Krusty the Clown Prison Special!"
Krusty the Clown,I SLUGGED SOME JERK IN TAHOE / THEY GAVE ME ONE TO THREE / MY HIGH-PRICED LAWYER SPRUNG ME ON A TECH-NI-CAL-I-TY / I'M JUST VISITING SPRINGFIELD PRISON / I GET TO SLEEP AT HOME TONIGHT --
Convicts,
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, hey, I kid! I kid 'cause I love. I tell ya, the best folk in the world are prison folk."
Convicts,
Bart Simpson,"Man, those cons love Krusty. Inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old boy."
Lisa Simpson,And vice versa.
Marge Simpson,"Just remember, Bart, convicts aren't ""cool."" They're bad people."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, maybe so. But they get the job done."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, now I know where my tax dollars are goin', huh?"
Fat Convict,
Krusty the Clown,"Hey hey, it's my old TV sidekick, Sideshow Bob! Why, I haven't seen you in years. Whattya been doing with yourself, Bob?"
Sideshow Bob,Can't you find it in your hearts just to let me live and work in peace?
Crowd,
Sideshow Bob,"Well, Krusty, as you may remember, after I tried to frame you for armed robbery, I tried to murder Selma Bouvier... Let's see, I rigged the mayoral elections, I tried to blow up Springfield with a nuclear device, and I tried to kill you..."
Krusty the Clown,
Sideshow Bob,"And, whenever I could find a spare moment, I've tried to murder Bart Simpson..."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"He said ""tried""!"
Marge Simpson,Someone should really go up there and talk to him.
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Ho-mer.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all those stairs..."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey."
Homer Simpson,"Your mother's right, Bart. Sure, you're the one who ruined all of Sideshow Bob's criminal schemes --"
Marge Simpson,"We're very proud of you, by the way."
Homer Simpson,"And sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --"
Marge Simpson,But he's safely locked away!
Homer Simpson,In a medium-security prison.
Marge Simpson,For life!
Homer Simpson,Unless he gets out somehow.
Marge Simpson,Which is impossible!
Homer Simpson,"Or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before."
Bart Simpson,"Thanks for trying, guys, but Sideshow Bob wants me dead, and Sideshow Bob is an unstoppable killing machine."
,
Sideshow Bob,I once was lost but now am found...
,
Sideshow Bob,...Was blind but now I see!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, that was lovely, Robert. You other cons could benefit from his shining example."
Convicts,
Sideshow Bob,"Really, Reverend, your praise is going to get me beaten up."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. But your transformation is truly inspiring."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"You know, it's hard to believe this model prisoner could be the same monstrous fiend who once ran for Mayor. It's a pleasure to have recommended you for the work release program."
Sideshow Bob,"Me? I'm touched, I really am. But you'll never find anyone willing to hire a five-time loser like me."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I already have.
Sideshow Bob,Cecil?
Sideshow Bob,Is it really you?
Cecil Terwilliger,"Hello, brother. I'm happy to see you."
Sideshow Bob,But it's been ten years! We haven't spoken since the... unpleasantness.
Cecil Terwilliger,You mean Arthur Fiedler's wake?
Sideshow Bob,"No, no, no. I mean our falling out."
Cecil Terwilliger,"Oh, that. That's ancient history. Let's make a fresh start. Come work for me."
Sideshow Bob,But this is wonderful!... You do know I used to have a... problem with trying to kill people?
Cecil Terwilliger,"Goodness, I had no idea. For, you see, I have been on Mars for the last decade. In a cave. With my eyes shut and my fingers in my ears."
Sideshow Bob,"TouchÃ©, Cecil."
Cecil Terwilliger,"I'm aware of your felonious past, but you are still my brother. And blood is thicker than bread and water."
Sideshow Bob,"You don't have to worry about me, brother. I'm all murdered out."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Praise the Lord.
Crowd,
Marge Simpson,How can you even think of releasing Sideshow Bob?
Bart Simpson,He's just faking it to get out of jail! He's a maniac!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Bob is no maniac. He explained his reasons for trying to kill us all, and I assure you they were perfectly sane."
Crowd,
Sideshow Bob,"My friends, please! I make no secret of my past, but isn't our system of justice based on the idea that a man can change?"
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, have the boys check into that."
Sideshow Bob,"I know I don't deserve another chance. But this is America, and as an American, aren't I entitled to one?"
Man In Crowd,Probably!
Bart Simpson,"Don't you see what you've done? Sideshow Bob hasn't reformed! He's pure evil! Oh, if only you knew what he was thinking..."
Sideshow Bob's Brain,I hope they still make that shampoo I like.
,
Cecil Terwilliger,Now make yourself at home. Perhaps a glass of Bordeaux? I have the '82 ChÃ¢teau Latour and a rather indifferent Rausan-SÃ©gla.
Sideshow Bob,"I've been in prison, Cecil. I'll be happy just as long as it doesn't taste like orange drink fermented under a radiator."
Cecil Terwilliger,That would be the Latour then.
,
Bart Simpson,"And God bless Mom and Dad and Lisa and Maggie, and please, God, kill Sideshow Bob --"
Marge Simpson,"Bart, no!"
Bart Simpson,"It's him or me, O Lord!"
Marge Simpson,You can't ask God to kill someone!
Homer Simpson,Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
,
Sideshow Bob,"Well, I suppose I should ask you what you do if I'm to be working with you."
Cecil Terwilliger,"For me, Bob. For me. I am Springfield's Chief Hydrological and Hydrodynamical Engineer."
Sideshow Bob,Hydrological and hydrodynamical? Talk about running the gamut.
Cecil Terwilliger,"Snigger all you like, Bob--"
Sideshow Bob,Thank you. I believe I shall.
Cecil Terwilliger,...but you'll find one gets more respect as a humble civil servant than as a homicidal maniac. Or a clown's sidekick.
Sideshow Bob,Aha! I knew it! You're still angry that Krusty picked me instead of you!
Cecil Terwilliger,I can't imagine what you mean.
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, come now! You wanted to be Krusty's sidekick since you were five! What about the buffoon lessons? The four years at Clown Kollege?"
Cecil Terwilliger,I'll thank you not to refer to Princeton that way.
Sideshow Bob,"The point is, you obviously still blame me for what happened at your audition."
Sideshow Bob,"Who is that? Why, it's Bart Simpson. Hellllooo, Bart!"
Hans Moleman,Help me!
1986 Cecil,"Thanks for driving me, Big Brother. These giant clown mitts are extremely hilarious, but they do make it difficult to shift gears."
1986 BOB,"That's the title of Erma Bombeck's latest, isn't it?"
1986 Krusty,Number 73 -- you're next. Make with the laugh-laugh!
,
1986 Krusty,Next!
1986 Cecil,"Uh, I have prepared a pie-in-the-face take?"
1986 Krusty,"All right. Knock yourself out, kid. Hal?"
1986 Krusty,"Free comedy tip, Slick: the pie gag's only funny when the sap's got dignity. Like that guy! Hey, Hal, pie job for Lord Autumnbottom there!"
1986 BOB,"Oh, dear."
EVERYONE BUT BOB AND CECIL,
1986 Krusty,"That guy's a genius! He's going to change the way we think about getting hit by pies! Chumley, you're hired!"
Cecil Terwilliger,"When that pie hit your face, I saw my dreams explode in a burst of cream and crust. But I suppose I should thank you. After all, it led me to my true calling."
Sideshow Bob,"Cecil, no civilization in history has ever considered ""Chief Hydrological Engineer"" a calling."
Cecil Terwilliger,
Sideshow Bob,"Yes, yes, the Cappadocians, fine."
,
Cecil Terwilliger,There it is -- the future site of the Springfield Hydroelectric Dam.
Sideshow Bob,Just the thought of all that raw surging power makes me wonder why the hell I should care.
Cecil Terwilliger,Because you'll be supervising the construction crew.
Sideshow Bob,"Oh great. Whenever a woman passes by, I suppose it will be my job to lead the hooting. ""Oh, yeah. Shake it, madam. Capital knockers."""
Cecil Terwilliger,"Come on, Bob. This is your chance to show the people of Springfield you can hold down an honest job."
Bart Simpson,"He's planning something evil, I know it. It must have something to do with the town's water supply."
Milhouse Van Houten,Maybe he's gonna pee in the river.
Bart Simpson,"Um... Nah, that's not his style."
Sideshow Bob,He's just a little shy because I've tried to kill him so many times.
Cecil Terwilliger,Ahh.
,
Sideshow Bob,"I really must thank you for this moment of tranquillity, Edna. You know, I haven't been on a date in six years."
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, the pleasure's mine, Bob. It's so exciting to be dating a killer."
Sideshow Bob,"To be fair, I never successfully killed anyone."
Edna Krabappel,Oh? I see...
Sideshow Bob,"I did once try to kill the world's greatest lover, but then I realized there are laws against suicide."
Edna Krabappel,
Sideshow Bob,
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, you!"
Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, nooo! That's Sideshow Bob!"
Edna Krabappel,"Well, that's the last time I announce my dinner plans in class."
Sideshow Bob,That was Edna Krabappel. You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel. I hope you're happy.
Bart Simpson,"I won't be happy until I find out what you're up to. Wherever you go and whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting."
Chief Wiggum,"He says that, but I bet he gives up pretty quickly."
,
,
Cecil Terwilliger,"Hello, brother. All's well, I trust?"
Sideshow Bob,It most certainly is not. The workmen you've given me don't know their asses from the hole in the ground they accidentally blew yesterday.
Cecil Terwilliger,"Come now, you speak as if they were a gaggle of slack-jawed yokels."
Cletus Spuckler,"Mr. Terwillidjer, come quick! There's trouble down to the ce-ment mixers, Sir."
,
Cletus Spuckler,"See, Cousin Merl and me was playin' fetch with Geech, that's our ol' smellhound, and..."
Cousin Merl,"Geech gone to heaven, Mr. Terwillidjer."
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, Cousin Merl, really!"
Cecil Terwilliger,"Temper, temper. You know Cousin Merl ain't been quite right lately."
Sideshow Bob,"Well, obviously."
Sideshow Bob,"I'm telling you, Cecil, I can't take much more of this! Rustic workmen who've turned the SaniJohn into a smokehouse..."
Sideshow Bob,Coveralls that don't quite cover all...
Sideshow Bob,And a psychotic little boy who will not stop hounding me. This little boy right here!
Sideshow Bob,Sometimes I wish this dam would burst and bury this cursed town.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, you said we were going to Dairy Queen."
Bart Simpson,I lied. Now help me rummage through Bob's trash for clues. Then I promise we'll go to the water slide.
Lisa Simpson,
Sideshow Bob,"You again! Well, that's it. I'm going to do what I should have done a long time ago."
,
Sideshow Bob,"Madam, your children are no more!... than a pair of ill-bred troublemakers."
Homer Simpson,Lisa too?
Sideshow Bob,"Especially Lisa. But especially Bart. If he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, I can't be held responsible for my actions."
Homer Simpson,"Well, I hope Bob fed you, 'cause I ate your dinners."
Lisa Simpson,"I know it's hard to accept, Bart, but face it: Sideshow Bob has changed."
Bart Simpson,"No, he hasn't. He's more the same than ever. And I know where the evidence is. There's only one place it could possibly be."
Lisa Simpson,Bob's trailer at the construction site?
Bart Simpson,That's even better. Let's go there.
Lisa Simpson,What were you thinking?
Bart Simpson,The Haunted Mine.
,
,
Bart Simpson,Blueprints... concrete invoices... construction schedule...
Lisa Simpson,"If I didn't know better, I'd swear Bob was building a dam."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Then explain this!"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, there must be millions of dollars there!"
Bart Simpson,What is Sideshow Bob doing with --
Sideshow Bob,
Lisa Simpson,
,
Sideshow Bob,Who left the lights on?!! Who's in here? Cletus? Cousin Merl? Big Hungry Joe?
Bart Simpson,I hink he nay have spotted us.
Lisa Simpson,Run!
Sideshow Bob,You two!
,
Sideshow Bob,Be careful! There's hydroelectricity in there!
,
Sideshow Bob,Will you children stop tormenting me? I've done nothing wrong.
Bart Simpson,"Give it up, Bob. We found the money."
Sideshow Bob,Where did that come from? I've never seen that money before in my life.
Lisa Simpson,Then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
Sideshow Bob,"I told you, I'm not a criminal anymore. You want to know what I've been up to? Here's a clue for you, Jack: One hundred thousand tons of reinforced concrete."
Sideshow Bob,"My God, it's completely hollow! What happened to all the concrete?"
Lisa Simpson,You cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself! That's what happened.
Bart Simpson,"Get 'im, Lis!"
Sideshow Bob,But I wasn't in charge of the money. Cecil was. Now let's stop bickering and get out of here. This dam could collapse at any minute.
Cecil Terwilliger,"One minute past sunrise, to be precise."
Cecil Terwilliger,"Once I blow up the dam, there'll be no evidence of missing concrete, and I walk away with fifteen million."
Lisa Simpson,But everyone will know you did this!
Cecil Terwilliger,"Perhaps. Or perhaps they'll blame the master criminal. You know, the one who's been working at the dam and has a grudge against Springfield."
Sideshow Bob,"Now I know Cousin Merl has had his troubles with the Revenuers, but he's hardly a master crim -- oh, you're referring to me."
Cecil Terwilliger,"Yes, I'm framing you and I'm doing a really excellent job, too."
Sideshow Bob,"Wait a minute. This is all because I got to be Krusty's sidekick instead of you, isn't it?"
Cecil Terwilliger,"Off the record -- yes. But officially, I did it for the money. Speaking of which... hand it over."
Cecil Terwilliger,Ta!
Cecil Terwilliger,I forgot to mention -- I'm planning to blow up the dam with you inside.
Lisa Simpson,"It's hopeless. Utterly, utterly hopeless."
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, I see. When it's one of my schemes, you can't foil it fast enough. But when Cecil tries to kill you, it's ""Hopeless, utterly utterly hopeless."" Well, if you kids aren't going to foil him, I'll have to do it myself."
Sideshow Bob,"Come on, quickly now!"
Sideshow Bob,"Bart, for once I'm not trying to kill you. I know it's an awkward situation, and I don't like it any more than you do. But you've got to trust me."
Bart Simpson,"Ah, what the hell."
,
,
,
Sideshow Bob,
,
Bart Simpson,Let's go again! Let's go again!
Lisa Simpson,No!
Sideshow Bob,"Come on, children! Let's go thwart my brother!"
,
Cecil Terwilliger,"I'M ON THE / TOP OF THE WORLD, LOOKING / DOWN ON CREATION, AND THE / ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN FIND... BOO-BOO-BOO..."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Um, do you know what you're doing?"
Sideshow Bob,"Lisa, you don't spend ten years as a homicidal maniac without learning a few things about dynamite."
,
Cecil Terwilliger,"Plunger? Check. Hardhat? Check. Fifteen million dollars and a gun? Check-mate. Goodbye, Bob."
Bart Simpson,Nooo!
Bart Simpson,Guess who!
Cecil Terwilliger,Maris?!
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bob, look!"
,
Cecil Terwilliger,"At last, I'm going to do what Bob never could -- kill Bart Simpson!"
Bart Simpson,By throwing me off a dam? Isn't that a little crude for a genius like you?
Cecil Terwilliger,"Ooh, I suppose it is."
Cecil Terwilliger,"Heh. If anyone asks, I'll lie."
Bart Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,
Sideshow Bob,Cecil!
Cecil Terwilliger,And now to kill you. There may be a slight ringing in your ears. Fortunately you'll be nowhere near them.
Bart Simpson,I guess this is it. Thanks anyway.
Sideshow Bob,"You know, I could snip the wires. We'd fall to our deaths, but we'd save the entire town. Bart, how would you like to do something incredibly noble?"
Bart Simpson,Do we have to?
Sideshow Bob,Yes.
Bart Simpson,
Sideshow Bob,
Sideshow Bob,"You -- you saved my life, Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah... I guess this means you can't ever try to kill me again, huh?"
Sideshow Bob,"Oh, I don't know about that. Joking! Joking!"
,
Sideshow Bob,"You've brought shame to this family, Cecil. Oh, I don't relish having to write the Christmas letter this year."
Cecil Terwilliger,"Nor I to read it. You know, Bob, all this time I thought you were a bungler, but destroying a city is far tougher than I thought."
Lou,"Here's your man, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,Cecil? I think not. This looks like the work of crazy old Sideshow Bob.
Lisa Simpson,"No, Chief, Bob's innocent! It's the truth!"
Chief Wiggum,"The truth, huh? That sounds like the testimony of crazy old Lisa Simpson."
Lou,"Uh, Cecil just voluntarily confessed, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,"That's some good work, Lou. You'll make sergeant for this."
Lou,"Uh, I already am a sergeant, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,Perhaps you are. But I say Bob goes back to jail.
Sideshow Bob,"But surely -- I mean, I caught Cecil..."
Chief Wiggum,Maybe so. But Lou here says you were resisting arrest.
Lou,"No I didn't, Chief."
Chief Wiggum,"Quiet, Lou. Or I will bust you down to sergeant so fast it'll make your head spin."
Bart Simpson,"Heh, funny, isn't it, Lis? Those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction."
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm going to look for the kids!"
Homer Simpson,
Ralph Wiggum,I think I wet my bed.
Sideshow Bob,But you can't do this! I saved the children's lives! I'm a hero!
Cecil Terwilliger,Tell them they'll live to regret this.
Sideshow Bob,"You'll live to regret this! Oh, thanks a lot. Now I look crazy."
Chief Wiggum,"There they go. Two criminal geniuses, locked away together.... Who knows what diabolical scheme they might concoct?"
,
Sideshow Bob,But I'm older! I get the top bunk!
Cecil Terwilliger,"Oh, poppycock! I called it at the arraignment!"
Cecil Terwilliger,So... when do they bring us the menus?
Kent Brockman,Tonight on Eye On Springfield: Opening day at the world's first two-story outhouse...
Man In Lower Outhouse,"Oh, God!! Stop!!"
Kent Brockman,...a comedy nurse who's laughing all the way to the blood bank!
Comedy Nurse,"Okay, how many of you are here for shoulder surgery?"
Comedy Nurse,Gotcha!
Kent Brockman,"But first, move over Baltimore, Springfield has stolen your idea!"
Kent Brockman,"I'm walking on the waterfront -- once the center of a thriving squid-gutting industry, now abandoned by all but a few longshoremen and allied trades-people."
Kent Brockman,"But the decades of rot will end with the opening of the South Street Squidport, an upscale shopping promenade with authentic maritime theming!"
Kent Brockman,"And to kick it all off in style, area merchants will host a black-tie gala Saturday night."
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that sounds fabulous, Homer. Stores throw the best parties."
Homer Simpson,"You like parties, huh? Well, I just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend."
Marge Simpson,You didn't remember that. You just saw it on TV.
Homer Simpson,The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
,
JANEY,"I can't get enough of ""The Babysitter Twins""! They arrested the counterfeiters, rescued the President and made four dollars!"
Lisa Simpson,"I love everything about the world of babysitting: the responsibility, the obligation, the pressure..."
JANEY,And full refrigerator privileges!
Lisa Simpson,"That's a trust, Janey. A sacred trust."
JANEY,"Geez, lighten up, Lisa."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"That concludes our service. All right. I have two announcements. Friday you will have the chance to ""party down"" in the church basement to the Jesus-rock stylings of ""Testament"". That's Friday, six p.m. sharp."
Bart Simpson,All the best bands are affiliated with Satan.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Also, anyone in need of a reliable and affordable babysitter should call Lisa Simpson."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Mention the topic of today's sermon to get a dollar off.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,The topic was love.
,
Lisa Simpson,Why hasn't anyone called?
Marge Simpson,"Maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. Parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. That's why they hire teenagers."
Lisa Simpson,But... but I'm very mature for my age. People often mistake me for nine.
Ned Flanders,"Homer, I've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. Y'know, Maude and her mother were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. They must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong God, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
Homer Simpson,"Militants, huh? Well, if I were you, I'd kick their asses."
Ned Flanders,"Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh..."
Lisa Simpson,I'll do it! I'll babysit!
Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. Todd's been pinching everyone lately."
Lisa Simpson,"But I'm smart and responsible, and my parents will be right next door!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, what do you say, Homer? Can Lisa babysit for my kids?"
Lisa Simpson,"Please, please, please!"
Homer Simpson,I'll have to ask her.
Todd Flanders,Daddy says dice are wicked.
Rod Flanders,We just move one space at a time. It's less fun that way!
Todd Flanders,Moth! Moth! Moth!
Lisa Simpson,Don't worry. A moth is no more harmful than a ladybug.
Todd Flanders,A ladybug?!
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, they're going to get eaten alive in middle school."
Rod Flanders,And thank you for sending Lisa to protect us from the bug you sent.
Todd Flanders,And please make Lisa tell us a bedtime story... about robots... named Rod and Todd. Amen.
Lisa Simpson,Once there was a robot named Todd...
Todd Flanders,Did he have a brother?
Lisa Simpson,"Yes, he had a brother robot named Rod, who was two space-years older than him."
Todd Flanders,I don't like this story.
Ned Flanders,"Oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! Oh, and Todd's as dry as a bone! Lisa, you're a wonder! I'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
,
Chief Wiggum,"So long, Lisa. If anything goes wrong, just dial 9-1-1. Unless it's an emergency."
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, Chief. Enjoy Bob Saget!"
Chief Wiggum,Heh. It's Bob Seger!
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, crap..."
Lisa Simpson,Now put your left leg into the left side of the pants -- and you're done.
Ralph Wiggum,I dressed myself!
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?"
Homer Simpson,Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
Bart Simpson,Why you wearing it now?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. You get all the mileage you can. Then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot."
,
Lisa Simpson,Thanks for the ride!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, you did a first-rate job of babysitting. I've never seen such a responsible young lady."
Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. Your trust means so much to me."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I only wish my Volvo mechanic were as reliable.
Chief Wiggum,Wahoo!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Good night, Lisa..."
,
Bart Simpson,You made all that money for sitting around and watching TV and eating food?
,
Bart Simpson,"Man, if I was making that kind of money, I'd be out of here so fast..."
,
Lisa Simpson,"You look so glamorous, Mom! Oh, and you smell like vanilla flowers!"
Bart Simpson,"And Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss!"
Homer Simpson,Can you see the pie stains?
Lisa Simpson,It'll be dark.
Bart Simpson,So when's Grampa getting here to babysit?
Marge Simpson,"Uh, Grampa's not coming..."
Bart Simpson,Not Patty and Selma!
Marge Simpson,"Actually, Bart, Lisa is going to be in charge tonight."
Bart Simpson,What?!
Marge Simpson,"I know she's young, but Lisa has proven herself mature and dependable."
Bart Simpson,"Dad, help me out!"
Homer Simpson,"Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says."
Bart Simpson,This is an outrage! I am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is! This is the greatest injustice in the history of the world!
Marge Simpson,"Well, we have to run. I'm sure you kids will work things out. Good night!"
Marge Simpson,"Make sure he brushes his teeth, Lisa."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter, but I'm not some ogre. I think you will find me fair and fun."
Bart Simpson,You're dead.
Lisa Simpson,"You should wash up for dinner. To make it fun, you can use the Mr. Bubble -- it'll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath!"
Bart Simpson,You are so dead.
,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's practically no traffic!"
Marge Simpson,"Uh, I don't think we should be driving here. The mayor's yelling at us."
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, geez. Okay, honey, remember where we're parked."
,
Bart Simpson,May I have some more lima beans?
Lisa Simpson,Certainly.
Bart Simpson,More than that.
Lisa Simpson,Certainly.
Bart Simpson,More.
Bart Simpson,More.
Bart Simpson,More.
Lisa Simpson,"Uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
Bart Simpson,"I didn't say I was gonna eat them. I just wanted to look at them, because they're so gross. What's for dessert?"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I'm a baby, huh? Well, then I'll act like a baby."
Bart Simpson,Ga-ga-goo-goo.
Lisa Simpson,Even babies know how to open and close their mouths. You need a bib.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, baby hate bib. Waah! Waah!"
Maggie Simpson,Waah! Waah!
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, look, Bart, now you got Maggie all upset!"
Bart Simpson,Relax. I'll give her some ice cream.
Maggie Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, that's coffee ice cream! It has caffeine in it!"
Bart Simpson,"Well, I guess that'll make things more interesting for you now, won't it?"
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, it's so beautiful! This is what I imagine Paris must be like!"
Homer Simpson,You've never been?
Marge Simpson,"I'm so honored that Springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. I guess this makes us ""yuppies,"" huh, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,"Nah, I'm really more of a slacker."
Marge Simpson,"Oooh, Malaria Zone! That's where all the explorers shop."
Homer Simpson,"Look, Marge! A restaurant owned by celebrities! I always wanted to be a celebrity!"
Rainier Wolfcastle,"Ha, ha, yes, it's true. The entire menu was personally approved by my secretary."
Marge Simpson,Isn't that clever? It looks like a Cadillac drove right into the building.
Homer Simpson,"Wow, even Moe's moved to fancy new digs."
Distressed Yuppie,"Hey, this isn't faux dive. This is a dive."
Moe Szyslak,"You're a long way from home, Yuppie boy. I'll start a tab."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Mag-gie, if you come down, I'll give you some more cof-fee."
Maggie Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Lots more coffee. Are you getting ready for bed, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,I am!
,
Bart Simpson,"That's right, I want the 25-foot Italian party sub. And don't skimp on the vinegar. It's time Lisa learned what babysitting Bart Simpson is all about..."
Bart Simpson,"Um, yes, I'd like to host an A.A. meeting. Tonight, if possible."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Maggie... Good Maggie... The talcum powder's not to play with..."
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, Bart, now it's really time for you to go to bed!"
Lisa Simpson,Why do you have to make this so hard?
Bart Simpson,I'm using non-violent resistance.
Lisa Simpson,Uch! The idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi...
Bart Simpson,Who?
Lisa Simpson,I'll answer it. You go to bed!
Young Italian Man #1,"Good evening there, miss. Here's yer giant sub, swimmin' in vinegar just the way you like it. It's gonna be $225, plus tip."
Lisa Simpson,What? I didn't order any giant sub!
Krusty the Clown,Hey hey! Are you ready to get rowdy?!
Lisa Simpson,Excuse me?
Krusty the Clown,Somebody hired me for an emergency bachelor party.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, there's been a mistake."
Krusty the Clown,"Well, I'm not leaving 'til I get paid! I get five hundred just for ""Hey hey!"""
Paramedic,Who called for an emergency sisterectomy?
Colonel Leslie Hapablap,We got a report that a Lisa Simpson spotted a U.F.O...
Lisa Simpson,I didn't see any U.F.O.!
Colonel Leslie Hapablap,"That's right, miss. You didn't."
Limo Driver,I'm here to pick up the ambassador from Ghana.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, he's not here! Nobody's here! And none of you should be here! You've all been tricked!"
Limo Driver,Why would the ambassador do such a thing?
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you are going to be in so much trouble when Mom and Dad get home. Now go to bed!"
Bart Simpson,You're the boss.
,
Lisa Simpson,I thought I told you to go to bed!
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right, ""bread."" You said go to ""bread""..."
Lisa Simpson,"I said go to ""bed."""
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, ""go to bread."""
Lisa Simpson,B-E-D -- BED!
Bart Simpson,"Ohhhhh, bed! Oh. Well, anything you say, sis."
,
Bart Simpson,You didn't say which bed!
Lisa Simpson,GO TO YOUR BED!
Bart Simpson,Make me!
Lisa Simpson,I'll make you!
Bart Simpson,"If you want me, you gotta catch me!"
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Almost!
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Oooh -- Oh -- so close!
Lisa Simpson,Ba-art!
Bart Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Oh my God!
Krusty the Clown,"Okay, we'll call it even if I can just have some of that big sandwich-- Uh, I'll come back."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, are you okay?!"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, yeah, I think so... It's just a bump on my head..."
Lisa Simpson,"Ew, your arm! It's got extra corners!"
Bart Simpson,"Yah! Oh, cool, it must be dislocated or something..."
Lisa Simpson,We have to get you to the emergency room!
Bart Simpson,And get this fixed? What's the rush? Don't you want everyone to see what a responsible babysitter you were?
Lisa Simpson,Stop it! Stand still! Maybe I can pop it back in.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, no! I'm going to preserve the evidence until Mom and Dad get home..."
Bart Simpson,And you'll never baby-sit again!
,
Homer Simpson,"You know, honey, when I think of all the good times we've had together-- AAAGH!"
Homer Simpson,"Did you see that, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh my God, you walked into the fountain! Get out of the fountain!"
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Just stand still and I'll get someone!
Homer Simpson,
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,Don't laugh at me! I was once like you!
,
Lisa Simpson,Bart! You need first aid! Let me in!
Bart Simpson,I'm afraid you'll hurt me again!
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, if you come out, I'll let you eat raw cookie dough. I'll let you... ride the lawn mower through the house. Come on, open the door!"
Lisa Simpson,What are you doing now?!
Bart Simpson,I'm banging my head! I'm going to make the lump even bigger!
Lisa Simpson,"No! As your babysitter, I order you to stop hitting your head on the wall!"
Lisa Simpson,"Bart? Did you stop because I said to? If so, thank you."
Lisa Simpson,Bart?
Lisa Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,911
Lisa Simpson,"Hello, this is Lisa Simpson, and..."
Emergency Operator,"Simpson?! Look, we've already been out there tonight for a sisterectomy, a case of severe butt-rot, and a leprechaun bite. How dumb do you think we are?"
Lisa Simpson,Wait! Dr. Hibbert!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Dislocated shoulder, bump on the noggin... My diagnosis: bad babysitting."
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, near as we can tell, the boy was studying quietly when the girl, drunk on her own sense of power, beat him silly with a block of frozen lima beans."
Bart Simpson,It's true!
Marge Simpson,"Young lady, you will never babysit again! I am so disappointed -ointed... - ointed... -ointed..."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I guess I don't have a choice..."
Lisa Simpson,Complete confidentiality? Oh. And I'm sure he's as good as Dr. Hibbert. It says so right in his ad.
,
Homer Simpson,"What's the matter, Marge? I thought you loved Jello shooters."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, I do. I'm just a little concerned about the kids. Maybe I should call."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on Marge, relax! Lisa's in charge. She's the responsible one."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hold on, Bart. Everything's going to be just fine. I'm going to get you to a doctor. He will fix you up, and by this time tomorrow we'll all be a happy family. Happy, happy, happy family."
Maggie Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Mag-gie!
,
Lisa Simpson,"Please, Maggie, please go to sleep!"
,
Snake Jailbird,"Yo, um, I must've, like, fallen on a bullet and it, like, drove itself into my gut."
Dr. Nick Riviera,"Hey, don't worry. You don't have to make up stories here. Save that for court!"
Lisa Simpson,"Um, excuse me, Mr. Smithers, Bart may be seriously hurt. Could we possibly go ahead of you?"
Waylon Smithers,Um... no. I really would rather get this taken care of.
Jasper Beardly,"Um, 'scuse me little lady. The wheelbarrow line is over there."
Comic Book Guy,Loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.
Lisa Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,Hold it right there.
Chief Wiggum,"Well, if it isn't Springfield's finest little babysitter, Lisa Simpson."
Lisa Simpson,Hi. How are you?
Chief Wiggum,"Um, I'm fine. Now Lisa, when you're walking down the side of the road you always wanna be sure to go with traffic, okay? Well, is that with traffic or against traffic? No, it's with traffic, with traffic. Anyway, good night."
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, hold on a minute. Let me have a look at that wheelbarrow, please."
Lisa Simpson,Okay...
Chief Wiggum,Just as I thought!
Chief Wiggum,"It's a Yard King. That is a quality barrow. Well, gotta run."
Lisa Simpson,Oh God! Where's Bart?!
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart, I'm so sorry. This is all like a bad dream..."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Citizens of Springfield, I officially declare this -- What the hell is that?!"
Seymour Skinner,"Why, it's Lisa Simpson! And look what she's doing!"
Crowd,
Maude Flanders,She's murdered her brother!
Lenny Leonard,And she's tryin' to dump the body in the harbor!
Otto Mann,"Well, duh..."
Sideshow Mel,"And as a grim finale, she intends to drown that poor caged baby!"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, what's happening? Where am I?"
Helen Lovejoy,And she is on DRUGS!!!
Homer Simpson,"Give me the drugs, Lisa."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm not on drugs. I was just trying--"
Marge Simpson,"His arm! Oh, my special little guy, are you okay?!"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Hmm. Dislocated shoulder, bump on the noggin... My diagnosis: a rather nasty fall caused by bad babysitting."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Bart. How's your arm?"
Bart Simpson,"It's all right. I was hoping they'd give me one of those steel claws, but what're ya gonna do?"
Bart Simpson,I'm... I'm sorry I was such a jerk last night. Guess I sort of ruined your babysitting business.
Lisa Simpson,"Eh, well, that's okay. I can always sell seeds. Do you want some seeds?"
Bart Simpson,No thanks.
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Hello, world's worst babysitter speaking."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Lisa! I'm glad I reached you. Are you available to babysit tonight?
Lisa Simpson,Aren't you afraid I might take drugs and injure your children?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Yes, that is a concern, but it's so hard to find a sitter. And I've got judo tonight."
,
Ned Flanders,"Lisa, Ned Flanders. You available tonight?"
Lisa Simpson,Didn't you hear I almost killed my brother?
Ned Flanders,You did? Just a minute. What time can you come over?
,
Bart Simpson,"You sure look stupid in that green dress, Lis."
Lisa Simpson,That's funny. I don't feel stupid.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, everybody's wearing green --"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, no..."
Kids,Pinch! Pinch! Pinch! Pinch! Pinch!
Nelson Muntz,"Happy St. Patrick's Day, loser!"
Bart Simpson,Ow! Quit it!
Milhouse Van Houten,"It's the wearin' o' the green, Bart! Pinch pinch pinch!"
Lisa Simpson,No one's pinching his legs.
,
Homer Simpson,"It's been St. Patrick's Day for hours and I'm still not drunk yet. Oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Moe, thank God you're here! We'd like to come in and drink, please!"
Lenny Leonard,"We kicked down the back door, but then there was a metal door."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, all right, listen up! This is the busiest drinkin' day of the year. Where are the designated drivers?"
Moe Szyslak,Beat it! I got no room for cheapskates.
,
Kent Brockman,"Top o' the mornin' to ye on this gray, drizzly afternoon. Kent O'Brockman live on Main Street, where today, everyone is a little bit Irish... except, of course, for the gays and the Italians."
Irish Cops,"All right, then, move along. / Nothin' to see here. / Show's over, folks."
Marge Simpson,"Parades just bring out so many emotions in me: joy, excitement, looking..."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, can I go buy one of those long plastic horns?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart, we've bought those before and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home."
Bart Simpson,I get bored with them... but that won't happen this time.
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Beep beep! Comin' through! Hey, Notre Dame, move it or lose it! Ah-oo-ga! Will the owner of the great big butt please move it out of my face?"
Drunken Revelers,"Hey, ma, I'm on TV! / Hey, where's that weather chick? / This is some wicked pahty, huh?! / Hey, have you seen Sully?"
Eddie,I don't know why people are always bad-mouthin' the Mafia.
Kent Brockman,"Get away from there! Hey! I need that pencil! Ladies and gentlemen, what you're seeing is a total disregard for the things St. Patrick's Day stands for. All this drinking, violence, destruction of property -- are these the things we think of when we think of the Irish?"
Crowd,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, give me some room! Watch the elbow, Seamus!"
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, look, everybody! Free beer!"
Krusty the Clown,"Open your yaps, boyos!"
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, what the --"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Everybody... everybody get naked! Come on, don't be stuck up, it's going to be great!"
Kirk Van Houten,"Well, why not? This party's just getting started..."
Shocked Old Woman,Stop the celebration! That small boy is drunk!
Bart Simpson,
Crowd,
Kids,"Yay, Bart!!"
,
Homer Simpson,Look at me! I'm the Prime Minister of Ireland!
Bar Crowd,
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Homer, ain't that your kid on TV?"
Bart Simpson,What are yew lookin' at?
,
Kent Brockman,"""What are you looking at?"" The innocent words of a drunken child. Well, I'll tell you what we're looking at, young man: a town gone mad. A town whose very conscience was washed away in a tide of beer and green vomit."
Bart Simpson,I'm going down to Moe's for a coupla beers.
Homer Simpson,I'll come with you.
Marge Simpson,No! No more drinking! I'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. What about that freezer lady in Georgia?"
Marge Simpson,
Kent Brockman,But what's the solution? Are we so bereft of ideas that we must revive the antiquated notion of prohibition? Channel Six says yes.
Homer Simpson,Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
,
Temperance Women,We want prohibition! We want prohibition!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"You can't seriously want to ban alcohol. It tastes great, makes women appear more attractive, and makes a person virtually invulnerable to criticism."
Helen Lovejoy,"Oh, won't somebody please think of the children?!"
Maude Flanders,What kind of an example are we setting?
Chief Wiggum,"Ladies, please. All our founding fathers, astronauts and World Series heroes have been either drunk or on cocaine."
,
Very Old Clerk,Seems there's been a prohibition law on the books in Springfield for 200 years. It's just never been enforced.
Councilmen,"Get outta here, ""Clerk Guy""!"
Very Old Clerk,There's also a law requiring ducks to wear long pants.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Wait a minute, let me see that. Well, I'll be darned, long pants..."
Maude Flanders,Read the other one. The non-duck one.
Mayor Joe Quimby,"""And spirituous beverages are hereby prohibited, under penalty of catapult."""
,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Did you see this, Bernice? It..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Oh my...
,
Head Of Duff,"No, we're not worried. Our customers buy Duff for its robust taste, not its alcoholic content. I predict our new alcohol-free ""Duff Zero"" will sell even better than our previous brand."
,
,
Head Of Duff,"Well, that's the end of me."
,
,
Narrator,"Dateline: Springfield. With prohibition back in force, sobriety's peaceful slumber was shattered by its noisy neighbor: the speakeasy!"
Homer Simpson,"Glad you're finally back in business, Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that was a scary coupla hours."
,
Narrator,"The suppliers of the illegal booze? Gangsters, running truckloads of smuggled hooch all the way from Shelbyville. And John Law was helpless."
Fat Tony,You didn't see nothin'.
Shocked Old Woman,So!
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, geez. This looks bad. Better turn on the old Wiggum charm."
Helen Lovejoy,
Helen Lovejoy,Pervert!!!
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, boy. That sounded bad."
,
Helen Lovejoy,We demand you bring in a police chief who will enforce the prohibition law.
Mayor Joe Quimby,Demand? Who are you to demand anything? I run this town. You're just a bunch of low-income nobodies.
Quimby's Aide,"Uh, election in November. Election in November."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"What, again? This stupid country."
Narrator,"With rum-running hoodlums in the catbird's seat, Springfield sent for the one man who could clean up the town and shoot the gangsters... Rex Banner."
,
,
Chief Wiggum,"Ow! Hey, I was watching that. And I was sitting there."
Rex Banner,"Rex Banner. I'm running this department now. Wiggum, you're out. Suspended indefinitely."
Chief Wiggum,Huh?
Rex Banner,Tuck in that shirt! Get those shoes shined! Take that badge out of your mouth! You're police officers.
Rex Banner,What are you waiting for? Somebody to kiss you goodbye?
Chief Wiggum,"Well, no, no... no. I guess not."
Narrator,"Wasting no time, Rex Banner tore into the bootleggers like a chippie tearing into a lobster."
Fat Tony,How do you know you don't like bribes if you've never taken one? Here.
Rex Banner,Say... this is nice... No! No bribes!
Fat Tony,"Okay, you win. From now on, we'll stick to smuggling heroin."
Rex Banner,See that you do.
,
Homer Simpson,"At first I thought prohibition was a good thing. People were drinking more and having a lot more fun. But without beer, prohibition doesn't work."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, hi, can I arrest any of you people for anything?"
Homer Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, rats, another gutter ball! Gee, Homer, you sure do suck tonight!"
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, geez. I don't have anything to do anymore. With Banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town. And so am I."
Homer Simpson,Now don't say that! Alcohol is a way of life. Alcohol is my way of life. And I aim to keep it!
Chief Wiggum,Sounds like you have a plan.
Homer Simpson,"Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do..."
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, boy, think of a plan."
Bart Simpson,"I'm trying, Dad."
Kent Brockman,"Kent Brockman at the now-closed Duff Bottling Plant, where a mysterious person in black keeps a solitary vigil..."
Figure,
Homer Simpson,I've got it!
Homer Simpson,"We're going out, Marge. If we don't come back, avenge our deaths."
Marge Simpson,All right.
,
Bart Simpson,"Whoa, bonanza! Let's load it up before the rats regroup."
Homer Simpson,"Right. Now remember, don't mention this to anyone. Not your mother, not Rex Banner, not anyone."
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope."
Bart Simpson,Yeah. Look at him trying to aim that stupid gun.
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hang on, son!"
Bart Simpson,Dad! Knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
Homer Simpson,Really? I heard good.
,
Marge Simpson,"What happened to you, Homer? And what have you done to the car?"
Homer Simpson,Nothin'.
Marge Simpson,I don't think it had broken axles before.
Homer Simpson,"Before! Before! You're living in the past, Marge! Quit living in the past."
Marge Simpson,That's funny... I used to be able to go down there.
Homer Simpson,Going bowling. Not back - avenge deaths.
Marge Simpson,Why do you have so many bowling balls?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!"
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, suck like a fox!"
Homer Simpson,
,
,
,
Moe Szyslak,"Here you go, Barn! That'll be forty-five bucks."
Barney Gumble,"Forty-five bucks?! Well, this better be the best tasting beer in the world! You got lucky..."
,
Homer Simpson,"You see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, so many wasted nights..."
,
Eddie,"What's the matter, Chief?"
Lou,"Yeah, you've barely touched your Banana Kaboom."
Rex Banner,This isn't a very happy birthday for Rex Banner.
Barney Gumble,"Hello, fishies!"
Barney Gumble,
Rex Banner,"Listen, rummy, I'm going to say it plain and simple: Where'd you pinch the hooch? Is some blind tiger jerking suds on the side?"
Barney Gumble,Yes?
,
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. I forgot to make sure the coast was clear. Aw, it's probably clear. Let's go."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Beer!
Homer Simpson,"I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!"
Marge Simpson,"You're the one the papers have been talking about. That mysterious ""Beer Baron"" who's been supplying Springfield with alcohol! How have you been getting away with this?"
Homer Simpson,"Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's very clever!"
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Lisa Simpson,Mo-om!
Marge Simpson,"Well, it is. I've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. Besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law..."
Homer Simpson,"It is silly, Marge. And look at all the money I'm making!"
Marge Simpson,Whooh...
Lisa Simpson,"Mo-om!! Prohibition may be unpopular, but it's the law and we still have to--"
"HOMER, MARGE AND BART","Go to your room, Lisa."
,
Rex Banner,"Open up, Curly. This is a raid."
Moe Szyslak,"A raid?! Curly?! Um, all right, but, uh, I don't know what you... expect to find in a simple, uh, neighborhood...pet shop."
Rex Banner,"Pet shop, eh? Well, I just have one question -- what kind of pet shop is filled with rambunctious yahoos and hot jazz music at 1:00 a.m.?"
Moe Szyslak,Um... er... the best damn pet shop in town!
Patrons,
Rex Banner,"All right... but you people remember: baby turtles and alligators may seem like a cute idea for a pet, but they grow up. Let's go, boys."
Barney Gumble,"Oww, those gears down there really hurt!"
,
Rex Banner,"You're out there somewhere, Beer Baron. And I'll find you."
Homer Simpson,No you won't.
Rex Banner,"Yes, I will."
Homer Simpson,Won't.
,
Narrator,"Dateline: Springfield. The elusive Beer Baron continued to thumb his nose at authorities. Swaggering about in a garish new hat, he seemed to say: ""Look at me, Rex Banner. I have a new hat."""
Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy, get crackin'! Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Dad..."
Homer Simpson,Call me Beer Baron.
Bart Simpson,"All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. We're out of business."
Homer Simpson,But I can't be out of beer. I'm the Beer Baron!
Moe Szyslak,"Homer! My customers are soberin' up, and they ain't gonna stay for the ambiance! You gotta get me more beer!"
Homer Simpson,"Sorry, I'm all out. Wha-- How about some turpentine? Or caulk? Delicious caulk..."
Moe Szyslak,"Look, find it, buy it, make it, I don't care. Just get me some booze, and fast!"
Homer Simpson,"""Make it,"" eh?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Forty-two bathtubs, please."
Seymour Skinner,Edna!
Helpful Clerk,"You know, they're fifty for $3000 today."
Homer Simpson,I said forty-two!
,
Lisa Simpson,Now you're making your own alcohol? That's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
Homer Simpson,"Remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. We're patriots. Like... all those people in jail."
,
Patrons,
Moe Szyslak,Who wants a bathtub mint julep?
,
Rex Banner,Are you the Beer Baron?
Ned Flanders,"Well, if you're talking about root beer, I plead guilt-didilly-ilty as char-dardilly-arged."
Rex Banner,"He's not the Baron, but he sounds drunk. Take 'im in."
Rex Banner,Are you the Beer Baron?
Comic Book Guy,"Yes, but only by night. By day, I'm a mild-mannered-reporter for a major metropolitan newspaper."
Rex Banner,"Don't crack wise with me, Tubby."
Comic Book Guy,"Tubby? Oh, yes, Tubby!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Banner, how's it hangin'?"
Rex Banner,None of your business.
,
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,What on earth happened down there?
Bart Simpson,One of the stills --
Homer Simpson,"Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner."
Homer Simpson,"Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. Your homemade liquor is exploding again."
Homer Simpson,"What, dear?"
Homer Simpson,Ka-BLAMMO.
Marge Simpson,"You've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. Why not quit now, while you're ahead?"
Homer Simpson,Boom.
Homer Simpson,I'll be right back.
Homer Simpson,It's hot!
Homer Simpson,"I thought about what you said, honey, and I've decided to quit."
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wonderful money."
Chief Wiggum,Stick 'em up.
Homer Simpson,"Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, never mind how I look. You gonna give me the money or not?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, I don't think so. You don't even have a trigger on that thing."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, I had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. C'mon, give me the dough. I can throw this pretty hard."
Homer Simpson,Poor Wiggum.
Chief Wiggum,Poor Wiggum.
Homer Simpson,"I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?"
Chief Wiggum,"Um, who?"
Homer Simpson,The guy who took your job.
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, yeah... More than anything in the world!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?"
Rex Banner,"I'm happy to report that the flow of illegal liquor seems to have dried up. Public drunkenness has ceased and those mysterious liquor clouds over Evergreen Terrace are gone. People, Rex Banner has won your war against alcohol."
Crowd,
Voice In Crowd,What about the Beer Baron?
Rex Banner,"I suspect he was just an invention of the media. The idea that someone like that could operate under my very nose is laughable. Well, you all know what laughter sounds like."
Kent Brockman,We now go live to Evergreen Terrace where I'm informed that former Police Chief Wiggum has captured the Beer Baron.
Crowd,/ Good golly! / Heavens! / They captured Homer?!
,
Chief Wiggum,"..then, the liquor-filled bowling balls travelled through a network of underground pipes, finally emerging at a nearby speakeasy."
Homer Simpson,"You forgot one thing, Wiggum."
Chief Wiggum,Yeah? What's that?
Homer Simpson,I filled the balls with a funnel.
Marge Simpson,"That was a very sweet thing you did for poor Wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?"
Homer Simpson,"Aw, probably just a slap on the wrist..."
,
Very Old Clerk,"...And he who shall violate this law, shall be punished by catapult."
Homer Simpson,Last time I help you.
Chief Wiggum,"Sorry. I thought you'd get a fine, or at most three, four years in jail."
Rex Banner,Hold it. This machine is two centuries old. Better test it first.
Rex Banner,"Okay, go ahead."
Marge Simpson,"Wait! Wait! You can't do this! All my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense. Now, I'll admit car crashes and fist fights have been down recently, but prohibition has cost us our freedom. Our freedom to drink."
Crowd,
Rex Banner,"Now hold on a minute, Missy. It's not up to us to choose which laws we want to obey. If it were, I'd kill everyone who looked at me cockeyed. Our laws are in place for a reason. And when someone..."
Chief Wiggum,"Send him back to momma, boys..."
Mayor Joe Quimby,"That was unexpected. Well, reset the catapult. And let's get this over with."
Very Old Clerk,Wait!
Very Old Clerk,I've discovered more lines on the parchment! It says that the prohibition law which was passed here 200 years ago was repealed 199 years ago.
Mayor Joe Quimby,Release the prisoner!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"On behalf of the city, I'd like to apologize, and ask how long it will take for you to flood this town with booze again."
Homer Simpson,"Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore."
Fat Tony,Four minutes.
,
Narrator,"And so, one town's brief flirtation with prohibition ended in a joyous remarriage to Lady Liquor! Congratulations, Springfield! We wish you the very best!"
Homer Simpson,"To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
Crowd,
,
Seymour Skinner,"And finally, the bake sale to raise money for the car wash has been canceled, due to confusion. Well, that concludes this morning's announcements. I'm Seymour Skinner and stand by to resume learning in five, four, three, two, one..."
,
Martin Prince,"M... Mrs. Krabappel, I also have an announcement to make!"
Edna Krabappel,Can't it wait 'til I retire?
Martin Prince,"I want one and all to join me in celebrating the anniversary of my portentous birth! Here you are, Nelson."
Nelson Muntz,A birthday party?
Martin Prince,"Here you are, Nelson."
Nelson Muntz,
Martin Prince,"Here you are, Nelson."
Nelson Muntz,I said !
,
Homer Simpson,"Alright, men. Get ready to blast off!"
Homer Simpson,"Wooo, we're in orbit now! What's that? A call from the president? Hello?... Uh, yes. ""Let me just say this about that."" Okay, Mr. President..."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, this is boring."
Bart Simpson,I guess we could go to Martin's party...
Milhouse Van Houten,"I don't know. If we're seen there, it'll definitely take our social standing down a notch."
Bart Simpson,"We're at what now, three?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"Three and a half. We get beat up, but we get an explanation."
Homer Simpson,Mayday! Mayday!
,
,
Edna Krabappel,Bart!
Bart Simpson,"Uh -- Mrs. K! Hey, it's Saturday! Your powers are useless against me."
Edna Krabappel,"Relax, I'm just here to have fun like everybody else. Don't think of me as a teacher."
Bart Simpson,Okay. So...
Edna Krabappel,Mmmm-hmmm?
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Excuse me.
,
Ralph Wiggum,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Houdini, why don't you saw Martin in half?"
Magician,"Oh, I'm not the kind of magician who does tricks. I'm a MATH-e-magician!"
Kids,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, man."
Magician,"Now, prepare to marvel at the mysteries of the universe as I make this remainder... disappear."
Lisa Simpson,But 7 goes into 28 4 times.
Magician,"Uh, this is a magic 7."
Edna Krabappel,Seymour.
Seymour Skinner,'Mind if I sit down?
Edna Krabappel,"Eh, it's a free country."
Seymour Skinner,"I, I don't follow you."
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, just sit down, Seymour. It might be nice to talk to a grown-up for a change. Heh."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, this party is certainly a break in my routine. You know, normally I spend my Saturdays carefully laying out my clothes for the following week, and then I stroll down to the car wash to see if Gus is there..."
Edna Krabappel,"Oh yeah, you gotta keep busy. I collect matchbooks from glamorous nightclubs. It's amazing. If you just write to them and ask them nicely..."
Seymour Skinner,"Is this how you imagined your life, Edna?"
Edna Krabappel,"Well, yes, but then I was a very depressed child."
Seymour Skinner,To poor decisions.
Edna Krabappel,"Here, here."
Agnes Skinner,Seymour!
Agnes Skinner,I told you not to play in the neighbors' yard!
Seymour Skinner,"It's a party, mother. I was invited."
Agnes Skinner,"Well... Then I must've been invited, too."
Seymour Skinner,"Help me, Edna."
Edna Krabappel,I know where we can hole up for a while.
,
Bart Simpson,That's it. Looking good. Getting warm...
Milhouse Van Houten,I feel queasy.
Bart Simpson,"Don't stop, Milhouse. You're so close!"
Milhouse Van Houten,I gotta barf! Where's the bathroom?!
Kids,I feel sick. / My tummy hurts! / ETC.
"Martin Prince, Sr.",I told you we should've served cake instead of oysters!
Martin Prince,I'm ruined!
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!...
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, how come you're not sick?"
Bart Simpson,"Eh, I gave my oysters to the cat."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, why'd you eat them? I thought you were a vegetarian."
Lisa Simpson,I didn't. I just wanted to leave.
,
Seymour Skinner,"More tea, Edna?"
Edna Krabappel,What kind of little boy has a tea set?
Seymour Skinner,Huh. I think we both know the answer to that... a lucky boy.
Edna Krabappel,"You know, Seymour, there's an innocence about you that can be quite charming."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh? Well, I've always admired your tart honesty and ability to be personally offended by broad social trends."
Edna Krabappel,Really?...
Seymour Skinner,Mmm-hmm. Very much. And your laugh...
Edna Krabappel,"You mean ""ha""?"
,
Edna Krabappel,I've got some menthol cigarettes.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, the heck with it!"
Seymour Skinner,Mmmmm.
,
Bart Simpson,"You are never going to guess what I saw at Martin's party after you guys left! You know that playhouse? Well, I..."
Seymour Skinner,Good gravy!
Cafeteria Worker,"Oh, thank you. It's just brown and water."
Bart Simpson,"So I looked in the window and there it was, the grossest sight I have ever..."
Seymour Skinner,"Bart Simpson, report to the Principal's Office immediately!"
Seymour Skinner,"Now, Bart... son... I don't know what you think you saw, but, uh, let me assure you..."
Edna Krabappel,"What Seymour... Oh... What Principal Skinner means to say, Bart, is that sometimes a little boy's imagination can run away with him."
Bart Simpson,That's the best you can do? You could've at least said you were giving her CPR or rehearsing a play.
Seymour Skinner,Is it too late to say that?
Edna Krabappel,"We're just a little concerned. If people were to find out the principal was dating a teacher, they might see it as a conflict of interest."
Seymour Skinner,
Seymour Skinner,And there are those who might try to use it against us for their own advantage.
Bart Simpson,Like me for one.
Seymour Skinner,"Like you for... Bart, if life has taught me one lesson repeatedly, it's to know when I'm beaten. Let's talk deal."
Edna Krabappel,"As you know, Bart, your permanent record will one day disqualify you from all but the hottest and noisiest jobs."
Seymour Skinner,"What do you say, son? You keep our secret and some other student can inherit your gloomy, windblown future."
Bart Simpson,Deal.
Seymour Skinner,This is a great day for forbidden love.
,
Seymour Skinner,Mmmm. This dessert is exquisite. What do you call it?
Edna Krabappel,Applesauce.
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, of course. I'm sorry, I... I don't get out to restaurants much."
Edna Krabappel,"That's okay, I don't entertain much. Usually it's just soup for one, salad for one, wine for three..."
Seymour Skinner,"You know, I always thought I'd fall for a woman just like Mother... even though I didn't want to. And now that I haven't, I've discovered what true happiness can be, Edna."
Edna Krabappel,"Seymour, swallow that applesauce and kiss me."
Seymour Skinner,I'm afraid I already swallowed it while you were talking.
Seymour Skinner,Mmm... / Oh... / / ETC.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Good morning, students. Way to go there, Wendell. There's Ralph -- he knows the score. Jimbo, how's that hat today? Janey, Janey, bo-faney!"
Edna Krabappel,"""The only way to survive a deadly blaze is..."" Oh heck, life is too short for fire safety. Let's go outside and pick wildflowers."
Kids,Yayyy!!
Seymour Skinner,Bart Simpson to the Principal's Office. Post haste.
Seymour Skinner,"Bart, so good to see you! I have a little favor to ask you."
Seymour Skinner,I'd like you to give this note to Edna when you get back to class. I don't think I have to tell you it's for her eyes only.
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,I hear reading...
,
,
Edna Krabappel,Do you think anyone saw us?
Seymour Skinner,"No. It went just as we planned, except they confiscated my thermos of cola at the door."
Edna Krabappel,Oh.
Gary Chalmers,Skinner. Krabappel. What are you two doing here?
Edna Krabappel,Superintendent Chalmers!
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, why, we're... We're, uh, on a... a, uh Uh, uh, what do you call... uh, field trip."
Edna Krabappel,"Uh, with a student."
Seymour Skinner,"Yes! He's, uh..."
Edna Krabappel,"He's, uh, he's... purchasing refreshments in the lobby."
Seymour Skinner,"I'll... I'll... I'll go get him right now. Car keys, car keys, car keys."
Bart Simpson,Stop pushing me. What's going on?
Seymour Skinner,Just enjoy the movie. It has Tom Berenger.
Gary Chalmers,Do you think they actually filmed this in Atlanta?
Bart Simpson,I don't know. I don't think it's important.
Gary Chalmers,Yeah.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Mother doesn't approve of me dating, so I need you to keep her busy for a few hours while Edna and I sneak out."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I can't take much more of this."
Agnes Skinner,"I collect pictures of cakes that I clip out of the magazines. It all started in 1941, when Good Housekeeping featured a photo of a lovely cake."
Bart Simpson,"You wouldn't happen to have any real cakes around here, would you?"
Agnes Skinner,"Oh, my, no. I don't care for cake. Too sweet. Now -- this is called a Lady Baltimore cake. At my age, I don't have much saliva left, so you'll have to lick my thumb before I can turn the page."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, can't I just turn the page for you?"
Agnes Skinner,No. But you can pick out any picture you want to take home with you.
Bart Simpson,Okay. That one.
Agnes Skinner,No!
Bart Simpson,Ow!
Agnes Skinner,You can't have that one! That's a coconut cake.
,
Edna Krabappel,"Bart Simpson! How many times do I have to tell you, no talking! Report to the principal's office!"
Bart Simpson,But... But I wasn't...
Edna Krabappel,"And here, take this with you."
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,"Mrs. Krabappel, Bart has something he wants to say to you."
Bart Simpson,I won't say it!
Seymour Skinner,Bart!
Bart Simpson,"Oh... I love you, Edna Krabappel."
Class,
Terri Mackleberry,Bart's going to marry the teacher!
Nelson Muntz,"Where are you registered, Simpson?"
Bart Simpson,
Edna Krabappel,"Thank you, Bart. That was very sweet. You may sit down now."
Bart Simpson,They're not going to get away with this.
Edna Krabappel,"I'm going to step out for a few minutes, class. Martin, you're in charge."
Martin Prince,"Now, Bart, uh, you must promise not to fall in love with me."
Class,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, now Martin's scoring off of me. Oh, that is it. Listen up, everybody! Follow me!"
Bart Simpson,"Okay crew, set your faces to stunned."
Kids,
Seymour Skinner,Um... Um.. School dismissed.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,...And then Bart opened the door and Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel were kissing... and swearing!
,
Pahasatira,Father! Uncle Apu! A teacher was in the closet with the principal and he had as many arms as Vishnu and they were all very busy!
Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Wow!
,
Lisa Simpson,"I was in the library at the time, but Janey told me that Principal Skinner and Bart's teacher, Mrs.... What's her name?"
Marge Simpson,Krabappel?
Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Krabappel. They were naked in the closet together."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, my goodness."
Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is ""Krabappel?"" I've been calling her ""Crandall."" Why didn't someone tell me? Oh, I've been making an idiot out of myself."
,
Ralph Wiggum,Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies. And the baby looked at me.
Chief Wiggum,"The baby looked at you? Sara, get me Superintendent Chalmers."
Chief Wiggum,"Thank you, Sara."
Sarah Wiggum,
,
Gary Chalmers,Skin-ner!!!
Seymour Skinner,Superintendent Chalmers!
Gary Chalmers,"The whole town's in an uproar about your sleazy shenanigans! Now I'm going to give you a choice. You can give up this tawdry, fulfilling relationship, or you two will be out of here so fast your mortarboards will spin. And where is your mortarboard, anyway?"
Seymour Skinner,"Uh, right here, sir!"
Gary Chalmers,"So what'll it be, Seymour?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well... I'm sorry, but, ah, I can't give up the woman I love."
Gary Chalmers,"Well then, I'm afraid you leave me no choice. I want you out of the building by three o'clock. You're fired. Edna, too."
,
Edna Krabappel,"Well, it's going to be hard to say good-bye to all of you. We've had a lot of fun together."
Edna Krabappel,"Nelson, Nelson, Nelson. Oh, how many kids have you beaten up this year?"
Nelson Muntz,I 'unno. Fifty.
Edna Krabappel,"Ah, fifty... Where does the time go?"
,
Bart Simpson,"You, you, uh, wanted to see me, Principal Skinner?"
Seymour Skinner,"Mmm-hmm, it's Mr. Skinner now. I'm just a man. Bart, I want to apologize for the awkward position Edna and I put you in. Your... your help made our love possible. I don't know what we'll do without you. Well, so long."
Bart Simpson,Wait a second. You don't have to leave just because Superintendent Chalmers told you to.
Seymour Skinner,What are you getting at?
Bart Simpson,"You've spent your whole life following orders -- from your mother, the army, Superintendent Chalmers. Just this once, man, stand up for yourself."
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, Bart."
Edna Krabappel,"Let's go, Seymour."
Seymour Skinner,"Okay, Edna."
Seymour Skinner,"I... No, wait! We're not going anywhere. I'm going to do what Bart should have told me to do a long time ago!"
,
Seymour Skinner,"Attention, Springfield. We have barricaded ourselves in the school and are not coming down until our demands are met."
Groundskeeper Willie,"Willie hears ya, Willie don't care."
Bart Simpson,"Obviously, you two have no experience causing a scene."
,
Kent Brockman,I'll be right there.
Kent Brockman,"Alright, people! We've got an escaped octopus on the roof of Springfield Elementary! Let's roll! Two cameras!"
,
Kent Brockman,"...and so once again, I've been had. But an even more interesting story has developed high atop this two story school. A love story..."
Gary Chalmers,Skinner!! Get off of my school!
Seymour Skinner,No! You get off of my school!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, Bart's up there!"
Homer Simpson,"Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house."
Bart Simpson,Did you check your pocket?
Homer Simpson,It was in... It was in my pocket.
,
Bart Simpson,You got it!
Chief Wiggum,"Damn. All right, boys, roll up the sound truck. We'll blast 'em out with music."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Edna, I hope this siege never ends."
Edna Krabappel,"Seymour, you're heaven in Hush Puppies."
Bart Simpson,Turn the music off!
Chief Wiggum,"Heh, it's working like a charm, boys! Now cut the power and hit 'em with the lights!"
Bart Simpson,
Seymour Skinner,I'll get it. Talk to me.
Gary Chalmers,"You have got to end this thing, Seymour."
Seymour Skinner,We're not coming down until our jobs are reinstated and you acknowledge and celebrate our love.
Gary Chalmers,"No one would like to celebrate your love more than I, but I am a public servant and not permitted to use my own judgment in any way."
Edna Krabappel,Then let us take our case directly to the townspeople!
Gary Chalmers,"Oh yeah, that'll be real productive. Who do you wanna talk to first? The guy in the bumblebee suit or the one with the bone through his hair?"
Sideshow Mel,My opinions are as valid as the next man's.
Gary Chalmers,"Yeah, all right. Just come on down."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, this is it."
Edna Krabappel,What are you going to do?
Seymour Skinner,"I'm going to go out there, and tell every man, woman and child that I love Edna Krabappel."
Bart Simpson,"Well, that's nice. But first, you've gotta grab their attention. And I think I know how..."
Seymour Skinner,I... have a bomb.
Crowd,
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, wait a minute. Those are hot dogs. Armour Hot dogs."
Gary Chalmers,What kind of man wears Armour Hot Dogs?
Seymour Skinner,"It was a good idea, Bart. But it's just not working."
Edna Krabappel,"Just speak from the heart, Seymour. Tell them how we brought a little happiness into each other's lives. Ask them why they're forcing two dedicated people to choose between their careers and their hearts..."
Maude Flanders,"Huh, excuse me, Edna. I don't think we're talking about ""love"" here, we're talking about S-E-X in front of the C-H-I-L-D-R-E-N."
Krusty the Clown,Sex Cauldron? I thought they closed that place down.
Seymour Skinner,What are you people talking about?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,My child told me you two were having sex in the school janitor's closet.
Chief Wiggum,"You know, ""making babies""?"
Crowd,"Yes, illicit sex! / Doing it! It! It! / Sordid public sexual congress! / Sex! /"
Seymour Skinner,"This is absurd. I did not have relations in that closet. And the fact is, I haven't... ...uh..."
Gary Chalmers,Yes?
Edna Krabappel,"Seymour, I think you'd better tell them. It's the only way to clear our names."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, everyone, the fact is: I haven't ever had relations. I am a virgin."
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, does this mean that Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin, too?"
Edna Krabappel,Ha!
Gary Chalmers,"Well, Seymour, it's clear you've been falsely accused, because no one... anywhere... ever... would pretend to be a forty-four-year-old virgin."
Krusty the Clown,"Oh, that's for sure!"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,I'm inclined to agree.
Groundskeeper Willie,Ach. I'll never look at him the same again.
Lenny Leonard,That was more than I wanted to know.
Gary Chalmers,"Okay, well, um, Edna, Seymour... in light of these, er, er, revelations, I, uh, suppose we, uh, overreacted."
Edna Krabappel,Do we have our jobs back?
Gary Chalmers,"What? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure. Just, um, you know, keep the lewdness to a minimum."
Bart Simpson,"I'm outta here. Skinny, Krabby, catch ya later."
Seymour Skinner,"Uh -- Hold on, Bart. May we have a word with you?"
Edna Krabappel,We want to thank you for helping us through a difficult period.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, no problemo. So, I guess now you'll be getting married or something, huh?"
Edna Krabappel,"Well, actually, Seymour and I have decided to break up."
Bart Simpson,Huh?
Seymour Skinner,"We can't continue on like this, trying to build a private relationship in public -- the whole town watching our every move with a fine-tooth comb."
Edna Krabappel,"Mm-hmm. I'm used to humiliation, but not in front of a crowd that size."
Lisa Simpson,No.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, but you seemed like such a good couple."
Edna Krabappel,"Bart, when you get a little older, you're going to learn that sometimes romances don't turn out exactly the way you'd like them to..."
Seymour Skinner,"That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them."
Seymour Skinner,
Edna Krabappel,"Whoo!... Oh, Seymour...!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Marge, mail's here."
Marge Simpson,"Bills... bills... oo, a free sample of gasoline... a note from Publishers' Clearinghouse saying we're out of the running... oh look, Lisa! You got something."

Homer Simpson,When? When? Ich bin hungrig!
Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is yours."
Homer Simpson,"Yes! My precious ""CarTOONS!"" ""Who pumped Ethyl?!"""
Bart Simpson,"Oh, how come I never get any mail?"
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, honey. Here, you can have the junk mail."
Bart Simpson,"Gas your termites... ""Freeze your termites""... ""Zap your termites""... ""Save the termites""... Hel-lo."
Bart Simpson,"""Dear Occupant: Because of your fine credit history, you have been pre-approved for a MoneyBank charge card..."""

Bart Simpson,My name is... Santa's Little Helper.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, mail's here."
Marge Simpson,"... Bills, bills... Oh a rejection letter from The New Yorker subscription department... Hmm. Who or what is ""Santos L. Halper?"""
Bart Simpson,"Wow, my own credit card! Thanks, ""Santos!"""
Bart Simpson,"A quarter?! Well, you're just the dog that keeps on giving, aren'cha?"
,
Bart Simpson,"... and ""Zebra Girl,"" and ""Zillionaire,"" and ""Zoidzilla."""
Comic Book Guy,And will there be any more splurging today?
Bart Simpson,"Oh my, yes. Hmm, I'll take that hardbound Radioactive Man collection."
Comic Book Guy,"Ah, a superb choice: in volume two, Radioactive Man travels through time to defeat Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympic Games."
Bart Simpson,"Put it all on my credit card, my good man."
Comic Book Guy,"Ooh, pardon me, ""Santos"" -- if that is your real name, Bart Simpson -- but your phony credit is no good here. Now make like my pants and split."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, what good's a credit card if you can't even use it?"
Bart Simpson,Order by phone. 1-800 -- Our phone doesn't go up to eight hundred. Unless...
,
Bart Simpson,"Mom, this is for you: 15 pounds of"
Bart Simpson,Vancouver smoked salmon. Here. Smell it!
,
Bart Simpson,And for Homer --
Homer Simpson,Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!
,
Bart Simpson,And for the college-bound... 500 stay-alert capsules.
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, ""Trucker's Choice."" That is so sweet."
Marge Simpson,"Bart, where did you get all this stuff?"
Bart Simpson,Let me answer that question with... cookware!
Marge Simpson,A frying pan radio. Wow!
Computerized Japanese Voice,You a winna. You a winna. You a winna.
Lisa Simpson,Halogen lamps? Kilim rugs? You can't afford this how can you afford this?
Bart Simpson,"Aw, you've been all edgy and suspicious ever since I gave you those pep pills."
Bart Simpson,"What are you talking about? I don't need pep pills to be suspicious if I want to comment on it I'll comment on it who's gonna stop me, you, Pep pill Boy? Pep Boys pills Beverly Sills oh boy oh boy oh boy uh-oh uh-oh oh boy I gotta start taking those pills again you think you're so great..."
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, boy, let's go for a walk!"
Bart Simpson,"No, not you -- Laddie."
,
Bart Simpson,"Whoa! ""The crowning achievement of the dogmaker's art. This limited edition Collie comes fully trained by Major Jonas Fong, A.L.B.D.A... only 800 will be bred... quite possibly the World's Best Dog."""
Bart Simpson,Twelve hundred bucks?! I better just get one.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, where are you going?"
Bart Simpson,"""Hello, my name is Laddie. I've been trained to gather fruit for you as a welcome gift."""
Laddie,
Bart Simpson,Good dog.
Bart Simpson,"Okay, watch this. Watch. Do a back-flip, Laddie!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, he's so smart!"
Lisa Simpson,"And so handsome! Bart, I just love him!"
Homer Simpson,"Hi Marge, hi Santa's Little Helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not Santa's Little Helper."
Marge Simpson,"That's Laddie. Bart says he won him at a church carnival, two towns over."
Lisa Simpson,"In a truth-telling contest. Right, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,"Uh, to the best of my recollection, yes."
Homer Simpson,"Wow, I gotta start going to church."
Lisa Simpson,"What've you got for me, boy? Hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day."
Bart Simpson,He's trained to do all sorts of stuff. He can herd sheep and perform CPR.
Marge Simpson,"""Some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."""
Homer Simpson,"Geez, that dog has more education than I do. He's some kinda super dog. Hey, where'd he go?"
Bart Simpson,Hullo?
Credit Representative,"Hello, Mr. Halper, I'm calling from MoneyBank Credit Services Department. I was wondering if you had a chance to read the threatening letter we sent you..."
Bart Simpson,Uhh...
Credit Representative,"... because you sound like a mature, responsible person who wouldn't want an unpaid credit card bill to spoil all his hopes and dreams for the future -- dreams such as home ownership, boat ownership, and event attendance. Now when can I tell my supervisor, Mr. Robinson, to expect payment?"
Bart Simpson,
Frank Grimes,No.
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, I've got a job for you."
Santa's Little Helper,
,
Bart Simpson,Good boy.
Legs,We didn't see nothin' if you didn't see nothin'.
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh no, repo men. Laddie, hide behind that bush there."
Bart Simpson,"Mom and Dad aren't home, are they?"
Lisa Simpson,"No. They went for a walk with the Flanders. Bart, what's going on? Why are these repo guys taking all your stuff?"
Bart Simpson,The dog and I got a credit card and...
Lisa Simpson,"A credit card? Oh, I knew you were up to no good."
Bart Simpson,"Okay, so I committed a little mail fraud. Haven't I been punished enough?"
Lisa Simpson,"Hey! Stop! You can take back the bassinet, but the baby is ours!"
Maggie Simpson,
Repo Goon #2,And the last item is one $1200 dog. Is that him?
Repo Goon #2,"Well, is he the dog or isn't he?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, that's him all right."
Bart Simpson,"Sorry, boy. I didn't plan this. It just sort of happened."
Bart Simpson,"Mom, can I feed Laddie at the table?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, it's against the house rule... Oh, I guess just this once."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie?"
Homer Simpson,Do you think he noticed?
Lisa Simpson,Where's Santa's Little Helper?
Homer Simpson,Who?
Bart Simpson,"Um, I took him to a kennel... two towns over. Just 'til the new dog gets settled."
Marge Simpson,"Well, we wrecked the first dog. We've got to treat this one right. Bart, why don't you take Laddie for another walk."
Homer Simpson,"No! Bart had his turn, let me! I can't resist his charms."
Lisa Simpson,Let's all walk Laddie.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, this park is great! How come we never take Santa's Little Helper here?"
Jasper Beardly,Ow.
Homer Simpson,Crowds give him gas.
Marge Simpson,"Besides, he's happy just hanging around the house with Bart."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, yeah."
Kent Brockman,"Hey, that is one fine-looking animal you've got there."
Homer Simpson,"Wow, TV's Kent Brockman."
Kent Brockman,"Ha, ha. Hey, this fellow's not available to stud, is he?"
Homer Simpson,"You want some puppies, eh, Mr. Brockman?"
Kent Brockman,"No, no, Jessica's been fixed. She just needs a little attention."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Why that canine has the proud bearing and glossy fur coat of a Yale man. Hello, little fella."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I believe this dog was in Skull and Bones."
Otto Mann,Whoa! Cool dog. Can he catch a frisbee?
Crowd,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Boy, Bart. Laddie's the best dog in the world. He's nothing like your old dog."
Bart Simpson,Santa's Little Helper? I guess I was the only one who loved him.
Milhouse Van Houten,"You got that right. Remember the time he ate my goldfish and you lied to me and said I never had any goldfish? But why'd I have the bowl, Bart? Why did I have the bowl?"
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, he was a great dog."
,
Bart Simpson,"Oh, Santa's Little Helper, I was crazy to give you up for another dog. What have I done to you?"
Heiress,"Captain, can't we go any faster? I greatly fear we shan't be in Wimbledon by noonfall."
Captain,"No worries, madam."
Captain,"Lumley, shovel on more dogs, won't you?"
Lumley,Aye-aye. More dogs!
Distant Voice,More dogs!
,
Bart Simpson,"Nah, that's not too likely."
Bart Simpson,"But still... you're gone. Oh, where are you, boy?"
Bart Simpson,Time for a walk. Again? We gotta find out where he's keeping these.
Homer Simpson,"I'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable."
,
Voice,Help! Help!
Bart Simpson,"Now what?! C'mon, I wanna go home."
,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"So Laddie, thank you for your heroic rescue, and Baby Gerald, we can't help but wonder what mischief you'll get into next."
Bart Simpson,Now can we go home?
Chief Wiggum,"Laddie saved the day, Simpson. Boy, we sure could use a dog like that on the force."
Bart Simpson,"Why don't you guys take him. I thought he was the right dog for me, but I guess I made a mistake."
Chief Wiggum,"Really? No foolin'? Aw, gee, thanks, mister. We'll take real good care of him and we'll play with him every day. Honest!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Maggie, you got oatmeal all over. Homer, would you clean her off?"
Homer Simpson,Can do.
Homer Simpson,"Laddie! C'mere, boy! Who want to lick a messy baby?"
Homer Simpson,Laddie?
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Dad? Laddie's not coming. I gave him away."
Marge Simpson,"What's the matter, Bart? Weren't you happy with him?"
Bart Simpson,No. He just wasn't the right dog for me. I'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.
Homer Simpson,He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
Marge Simpson,"Well, if that's what you think is best, let's just go down to the kennel and get Santa's Little Helper back."
Bart Simpson,"We can't. He's not in a kennel. I gave him away, too, and I don't know where he is."
Homer Simpson,You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!
Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry, I know it's wrong. I messed everything up and now I don't have any dogs at all."
Homer Simpson,"There, there, shut up, boy. We'll just get you a new dog."
Bart Simpson,I don't want a new dog. I want Santa's Little Helper.
Homer Simpson,"Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
Bart Simpson,You're right. I'll do it.
Chief Wiggum,I love this song.
Homer Simpson,Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.
Bart Simpson,I'm going to get the dog back.
Homer Simpson,The bad dog or the good dog?
Bart Simpson,The bad dog.
Homer Simpson,Oh good.
,
Moe Szyslak,You gotta give me back my floor!
Moe Szyslak,My customers are walking around on the pipes.
Tommy,"Hey, next time pay your bills."
Moe Szyslak,But I don't want to!
Bart Simpson,"Excuse me, sir. Did you repossess this dog from a guy named Santos L. Halper?"
Tommy,"Hmm... yeah, yeah, I remember this mutt. We, uh, sold him to some guy wearing a dress."
Patty Bouvier,"No, I didn't buy your dog. Now I gotta go keep an eye on Selma -- she thinks she swallowed a Band-Aid."
,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Yeah, I bought yer mutt. And I ate him."
Bart Simpson,
Groundskeeper Willie,"Yeah, I ate his little face. I ate his guts. And I ate the way he's always barking... so I gave him to the church."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I see. You hate him, so you gave him to the church."
Groundskeeper Willie,Aye. I also ate the mess he left on me rug. You heard me.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Mmm, yes, I remember ""Satan's Little Helper"" -- littering the rectory with his dirt, biting me in the apse..."
Agnes Skinner,He unholied the Holy Water!
Bart Simpson,That's him all right. I'll be happy to take him off your hands.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible, Bart. He's no longer among us."
Bart Simpson,You didn't crucify him?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"No, he's safely with one of our parishioners. I'll give you his address if you like."

Bart Simpson,"Hey, it's him! It's Santa's Little Helper!"
Mitchell,Yes?

Mitchell,Give me one minute.
Bart Simpson,"Okay, showtime!"
Bart Simpson,"""Please, mister... "" No, let me do that again. ""Please, mister... please?!"""
Mitchell,Hi there. How can I help you?
Bart Simpson,You're the guy who owns the dog?
Mitchell,"Yup, his name is Sprinkles!"
Bart Simpson,Sprinkles?!
Mitchell,"Yeah, he's my best buddy. Huh? Especially since my parrot decided to stop talking."
Mitchell,"Polly, wanna say ""Hi"" to our guest? Huh? Fine, be that way. Now, what can I do ya for, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Oh, nothin'. Forget it."
,
Bart Simpson,... So that's my plan. I'm gonna break into the blind man's yard and swipe the dog.
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, that is a new low."
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I'm not saying it's gonna be a dance around the maypole."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I won't tell Mom and Dad, but only because I want the dog back. Just try not to freak out the blind man."
Bart Simpson,I can't promise I'll try. But I'll try to try.
,
Bart Simpson,"Here, boy! Come on!"
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Psst!
Bart Simpson,"Oh, I missed you so much, boy! C'mon, let's get outta here! Now keep quiet, okay?"
Santa's Little Helper,
Mitchell,Sprinkles?! Is there somebody down there?!
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, boy. Let's blow."
Mitchell,Who's there?! I can take you on!! You wanna try me? Come on!!
Mitchell,"Where is he, Sprinkles? Let's get him!"
,
Mitchell,"I may be blind, but you just ran into a closet!"
Bart Simpson,
Mitchell,Heh heh.
Lou,Hey Chief.
Mitchell,"Hey, burglar! I hope you're having a good time in there, 'cause the police will be here any minute!"
Bart Simpson,"No, mister! Please, I'm just a kid. I... I only came to get my dog back."
Mitchell,Your dog?
Bart Simpson,...and I miss him so much and I know you like him but I like him too and he was mine first and I know I don't deserve him but...
Mitchell,So what this comes down to is: you want a blind man to give up his only companion.
Bart Simpson,"Yes, please."
Mitchell,Tell ya what. Why don't we let the dog decide?
Mitchell,"C'mon, Sprinkles! Here, Sprinkles!"
Bart Simpson,"C'mon, Santa's Little Helper! I'm sorry I ever let you go! Pick me! Please pick me!"
Bart Simpson,"Attaboy! I knew you'd come! Gimme a kiss! Oh, yeah!"
Mitchell,Sounds like you won. Congratulations.
Bart Simpson,"Oh geez, I'm sorry. I wish there was some way we could both have a dog."
Chief Wiggum,"Hello... Police... Aw, man, if this one's not the right house, I quit."
Mitchell,"It's okay, Officer. False alarm."
Mitchell,"Hey, who's that? I like you, too!"
Chief Wiggum,"Well, looks like somebody's made a new best friend."
Mitchell,"Okay, boy, that's enough... That's not for doggies..."
Lou,Marijuana!
Chief Wiggum,"Well! I guess he didn't like you after all. He just smelled your narcotics! Book 'em, boys."
Eddie,"Hold on, Chief. It might be medicinal."
Mitchell,"Yeah... medicinal! Without it, I could, uh, go even blinder! Right?"
Chief Wiggum,"Eh, this might take awhile, kid. Why don't you and your buddy run along?"
Bart Simpson,"Bye, Laddie."
,
Bart Simpson,"Come on, boy, let's go home and have some fun. That cat's been strutting around like she owns the place..."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, hey, Lou! Don't bogart that medicine!"
Lou,"Hey, hey everybody. How you doin'? Hey! What's up here?"
Chief Wiggum,Shut up! I love this song.

,
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, what in the heck are you doing?"
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, it's for my Junior Achievers Club. We're trying to earn money by recycling."
Bart Simpson,"Aw, recycling is useless, Lis. Once the sun burns out, this planet is doomed. You're just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think it's a great idea."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, Mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!"
Homer Simpson,Marge!
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm sorry!"
Lisa Simpson,And you have to cut these up first. Otherwise animals get caught in them.
Bart Simpson,Only the stupid ones.
Lisa Simpson,I could still use more paper.
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know where there's lots of paper!"
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,Dad! You're not supposed to have fun recycling. This is serious.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay."
,
Seymour Skinner,"What a load of garbage! I'm ecstatic. With the money from this, we're within striking distance of our trip to Albany."
Kids,
Seymour Skinner,"Super. Now, let's give a big Junior Achievers welcome to our guest speaker -- I know he can teach us a lot about business -- Mr. C. Montgomery Burns!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'll keep it short and sweet. Family, religion, friendship: these are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. When opportunity knocks, you don't want to be driving to the maternity hospital or sitting in some phony baloney church. Or synagogue. Questions?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I'm going to take advantage of this rare opportunity, even if you children aren't interested. Uh... Which do you think is more important: hard work or stick-to-it-iveness?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Are there any real questions?
Lisa Simpson,"Yes. Um, does your plant have a recycling program?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Ree-cyyy-cling?
C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that term, you adorable little ragamuffin."
Lisa Simpson,Hmm. You've never heard of recycling? It means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, so Mother Nature needs a favor? Well, maybe she should have thought of that when she was besetting us with droughts and floods and poison monkeys. Nature started the fight for survival and now she wants to quit because she's losing? Well, I say ""hard cheese!"""
Lisa Simpson,But nature's not our enemy.
C. Montgomery Burns,Well surely you agree we can do without her.
Lisa Simpson,No! I don't agree!
C. Montgomery Burns,No?
Waylon Smithers,How dare you question Mr. Burns?
,
Lisa Simpson,"But according to your most recent biography, you only have one hundred million dollars today."
Waylon Smithers,"Um, actually, sir, it's uh, considerably less than that."
C. Montgomery Burns,"I, um... have to go."
Seymour Skinner,"Monty Burns, everybody!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I've called you all here because I need some honest answers. What is my current financial situation?
Stockbroker,Great.
Blue-Haired Lawyer,Great.
Waylon Smithers,I hear great.
C. Montgomery Burns,"All right. Well, let's have a look at my stock portfolio."
C. Montgomery Burns,Hmm... Confederated Slave Holdings. How is that doing?
Stockbroker,It's uh... uh... steady.
Waylon Smithers,"I'm sure all your stocks are doing well, sir. After all, you chose them."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, let's get out the old stock ticker and have a look..."
Homer Simpson,Can Lenny have it?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Eh, here's where I stopped checking it last time: September nineteen twenty ni-- Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Smithers, why didn't you tell me about this market crash?!"
Waylon Smithers,"Um, well, sir, it happened 25 years before I was born."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's your excuse for everything. I've got to do something to get my money back quickly. This calls for an aggressive trading strategy."
ADVISORS & SMITHERS,"Good idea, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Take fifty percent of my money and put it in the blue chips: Trans-Atlantic Zeppelin, Amalgamated Spats, Congreve's Inflammable Powders, U.S. Hay... and sink the rest into that up-and-coming Baltimore Opera Hat Company. That should set things right again, eh, boys?"
ADVISORS & SMITHERS,"Yes, sir! / Absolutely! / Genius! / Can't go wrong with Congreve's."

Seymour Skinner,"A half ton of newspaper and all we get is seventy-five cents? Huh, that won't even cover the gas I used to go to the store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles."
Hippie,"It sounds like you're working for your car. Simplify, man."
Seymour Skinner,Oh! Well!
Seymour Skinner,"Sorry, kids, the trip to Albany is off, and there's to be no more recycling."
Lisa Simpson,But we didn't do that badly. We collected enough paper to save one whole tree.
Kids,
Ralph Wiggum,"Oh, mommy, help!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Are you saying my money's all gone?!
C. Montgomery Burns,But... I made all the right moves! Didn't I?
ADVISORS & SMITHERS,Yes! / Absolutely! / Every move a right one!
C. Montgomery Burns,I see it all now! You're just a bunch of yesmen! I was making the wrong moves and you were too gutless to tell me. Isn't that right?
ADVISORS & SMITHERS,"Yes. / Absolutely. / Dead on, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Then I'll fix this myself. Smithers, take out another mortgage on the plant."
Waylon Smithers,"The bank has already foreclosed on the plant, and your house, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,But... what will I do?
Waylon Smithers,"Well, the first thing you'll have to do is move out of the bank's house. I'll help you pack."
,
Worker,Go on! Get outta here!
Real Estate Agent,"...and I'm sure a pro wrestler such as yourself will appreciate all the closet space, Hitman."
"Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart",Eww. This place has got old man stink.
C. Montgomery Burns,
Waylon Smithers,"Don't listen to him, sir. You've got an enchanting musk."
Real Estate Agent,...and you wouldn't even be the only wrestler in the neighborhood. The Shrieking Sheik lives just three doors away.
Shrieking Sheik,
"Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart","Hey, hey, I'll take it."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, would it be all right if I kept this portrait? To remind me of better times?"
"Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart",Why would I want a picture of a pitiful pencil-necked geek?
C. Montgomery Burns,Why indeed...
Waylon Smithers,"I'll make sure he forwards your Social Security check, Sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you didn't tell me Mr. Burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant."
Homer Simpson,Now I can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
Marge Simpson,You told me about that candy bar you found three times!
Bart Simpson,You found a candy bar?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes! Gather 'round, my son, and I shall tell you a tale..."
Lisa Simpson,"I normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes, but on behalf of the recycling community: HA! It couldn't happen to anyone more deserving."
Marge Simpson,"They're not going to close the plant, are they?"
Homer Simpson,"No, the bank put Lenny in charge."
,
Lenny Leonard,"Uhhh, attention everybody. Work harder. Bye!"
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, but Daddy doesn't feel so good."
Waylon Smithers,"Well, sir, I have to get to work. Lenny's a real bear on tardiness."
C. Montgomery Burns,Are there any chores I can do?
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, no, no. You just stay here and maintain your dignity."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, here's a chance to earn my keep. I will go out and get these items from the food jobber."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Grocery store, please!"
C. Montgomery Burns,I am riding on a bus.
Barney Gumble,"Hey, aren't you that guy everybody hates?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh my, no! I'm Monty Burns!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I'm shopping.
C. Montgomery Burns,Oh my... I wonder which is the cereal for me...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, oh, excuse me, can you tell me where I might find the ""Burns-O's""?"
Krusty the Clown,"Sorry, Pops. They don't put nobodies on cereal boxes."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm. Well, I suppose this one looks a bit like me..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, thank you, Shoppie. I... I ventured in to search for milk when the door snapped shut behind me."
Clerk,"Yeah, those dairy cases are death traps."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ketchup, catsup... ketchup, catsup... ketchup, catsup... Ugh. I'm in way over my head."
Clerk,He's talking to the ketchup now! Burns is sure acting nutty.
Manager,Maybe going broke and losing his plant destroyed his brain.
Manager,"Could you come along with us, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Are you here to solve my ketchup problem?
Clerk,Yes. That's right.
,
C. Montgomery Burns,Wh... where are you taking me? What's happening?
Chief Wiggum,"Relax. You've gone off your nut, so we're stuffing you into an old folks home. Those, uh, store guys signed the commitment papers."
C. Montgomery Burns,But I'm shopping!
,
Homer Simpson,"Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling I can handle today."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, if you just drink one more, I'll have a full bag."
Lisa Simpson,There's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
Homer Simpson,"Hey, why don't you try the old folks home? They practically live in their own filth!"
Lisa Simpson,"Thanks, Dad!"
Homer Simpson,"You're welcome, honey."
,
Grampa Simpson,"That's the activity room. We're not allowed in there. That's the library. Not allowed in there, either. And don't even think about going in the game room..."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Egad, man, how are we supposed to pass the time?"
Grampa Simpson,Best bet is to stake yourself out a good spot at the starin' window...
C. Montgomery Burns,
Activity Coordinator,"Come on, Mr. Burns! Join the fun!"
Activity Coordinator,That's the spirit!
C. Montgomery Burns,So this is how the Monty Burns saga ends... If I hadn't surrounded myself with those spineless yes men...
Lisa Simpson,"What do you mean you don't have anything to recycle? You must have some magazines, or newspapers."
C. Montgomery Burns,"That voice! That shrill, disagreeable voice! It's her!"
Grampa Simpson,"Sorry, we're not allowed to read newspapers. They angry up the blood."
C. Montgomery Burns,You! The troublemaking girl!
Lisa Simpson,"My name is Lisa, Mr. Burns. Lisa Simpson."
C. Montgomery Burns,"It doesn't matter what your name is, you idiot! What I want to know is: will you help me get my money back?"
Lisa Simpson,Ha! I'd never help you. You're the worst man in the world.
C. Montgomery Burns,Yes! That's the kind of moxie I'm looking for. You're hired!
Lisa Simpson,"No, I'm not!"
Waylon Smithers,"Sir, I'm so sorry my grocer committed you. We'll never shop there again."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Not now, Smithers. I've got an empire to rebuild, and the person who's going to help me is... that girl!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Please!
Lisa Simpson,No.
C. Montgomery Burns,Please!
Lisa Simpson,No.
C. Montgomery Burns,Please!
C. Montgomery Burns,"Sir, we've never met before, but my name is Mr. Burns and I want your daughter to help make me rich again."
Homer Simpson,You mean Maggie?
C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, the baby who shot me. No, I was referring to your other daughter."
Homer Simpson,Lisa! You have a guest!
Homer Simpson,"So, um, how's life in the gutter?"
Lisa Simpson,You again.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I've realized the error of my ways, Lisa. I need someone with your integrity to help me. Please don't refuse this poor old man."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh... if I did agree to help you, you could only earn money by doing good, socially responsible things. Nothing evil."
C. Montgomery Burns,Nothing evil. That's exactly the kind of radical thinking I need! It's a deal.
Homer Simpson,"See that, boy? Why aren't you making any business deals?"
Bart Simpson,I'll do it this afternoon...
,
C. Montgomery Burns,You mean there are actually people who will pay good money for garbage?
Lisa Simpson,"Not good money, really. Each can'll get you a nickel."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't pooh-pooh a nickel, Lisa. A nickel will buy you a steak and kidney pie, a cup of coffee, a slice of cheesecake, and a newsreel! With enough change leftover to ride the trolley from Battery Park to the Polo Grounds."
Lisa Simpson,There's a can.
Lisa Simpson,You have to cut these six-pack holders up. Otherwise fish get trapped in them.
C. Montgomery Burns,I see...
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!

,
C. Montgomery Burns,"My first dollar! Thanks to you, Lisa, and our hemp-smoking friend. Shine on, you crazy diamond."
Hippie,"Sounds like somebody's living in the past. Contemporize, man!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Lisa, as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent."
Homer Simpson,It's all right. I understand. But we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.
Frank Grimes,No.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I'm not doing this for the money. I'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments."
C. Montgomery Burns,There's a can.
Kent Brockman,"And from our ""It's Funny When It Happens To Them"" file... Remember millionaire C. Montgomery Burns? The man who blocked out our sun, ran over a local boy, and stole Christmas from 1981 to 1985? Well, guess who's flat broke and picking up trash for a living?"
Homer Simpson,"Please be Flanders, please be Flanders, please be Flanders..."
Kent Brockman,"Excuse me, Mr. Burns, now that you're completely ruined, how do you feel?"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. I'm on my way back to the top. I've turned these cans into ""can do!"""
Kent Brockman,"Well, you smell terrible! Good luck to you, sir."
Marge Simpson,"Wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking."
Homer Simpson,"Good one, Mom! / You're so bad, honey."
Lisa Simpson,You guys shouldn't laugh at him. Mr. Burns has changed. He's different now.
Marge Simpson,"Yeah, he's broke!"
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Two in a row!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, you've really turned my life around these past few weeks, Lisa. I've got my own business again, my beloved employees... oh consargnit. Eh, come on, let's pick up the pace, you neglected old nincompoops!"
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. You have to show them they're appreciated."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, capital idea, partner. People, if we meet this week's quota, I'll take you to the most duck-filled pond you ever sat by."
Grampa Simpson,"Oh, hot-diggity! That's how they got me to vote for Lyndon LaRouche!"
,
Lisa Simpson,"Wow, even I didn't know he was so committed to recycling! See? I told you Mr. Burns has changed. See?"
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, nobody likes a gloater. Right, Homie?"
Homer Simpson,Uh-huh.
Marge Simpson,See!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, thank you, everyone. But -- 10% of your applause should go to my little partner, Lisa Simpson. For if it were not for her infectious moralizing, we would not be here today to witness the unveiling of... The Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant!"
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, ain't that cute? Makes Li'l Debbie look like a pile of puke!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"Would you like to be the first to take a tour of the plant, Li'l Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,I'd love to -- Partner!
,
C. Montgomery Burns,The whole plant is a environmentally-sound. It's powered by old newspapers. The machinery is made entirely of used cans. And the windows are from the old liquor bottles we collected.
C. Montgomery Burns,I thought I told you to stop licking my windows!
Barney Gumble,"I know... You told me. And when I woke up this morning, I said: ""Barney, you're not gonna let that man.... """
Lisa Simpson,"I'm so proud of you, Mr. Burns! You're getting your fortune back and you're doing it without endangering the planet or cozying up to the Aspen crowd."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, hold your accolades to the end of the tour. You haven't seen the best part!"
,
C. Montgomery Burns,I couldn't watch your demonstration of the fish caught in the plastic rings without getting an idea. Look out over the water.
C. Montgomery Burns,"I figured if one six-pack holder will catch one fish, a million sewn together will catch a million fish. Watch."
Lisa Simpson,What's going on?
C. Montgomery Burns,I call it the Burns Omni-Net. It sweeps the sea clean.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, dear God!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I call our product: Li'l Lisa's Patented Animal Slurry! It's a high-protein feed for farm animals, insulation for low-income housing, a powerful explosive, and a top-notch engine coolant. And best of all, it's made from 100% recycled animals!"
Lisa Simpson,I think I'm going to be sick...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, a spoonful of slurry will cure what ails ya!"
Lisa Simpson,"Ach! You haven't changed at all! You're still evil! And when you're trying to be good, you're even more evil!"
C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't understand. Pigs need food, engines need coolant, dynamiters need dynamite. I'm supplying it to them, at a tidy profit, and not a single sea creature was wasted. You inspired it all, Li'l Lisa."
,
Lisa Simpson,Stop! Don't recycle! It's murder! You're helping Mr. Burns!
Female Resident,But you told us to recycle!
Male Resident,You convinced us it was good.
Lisa Simpson,No! It's evil! Please stop recycling!
Several Residents,Stop! You can't mix plastic with paper.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! I was a fool to help that horrible old man!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I hope you learned your lesson, Lisa. Never help anyone."
Waylon Smithers,"Simpson, what are you doing here? Why aren't you at work?"
Homer Simpson,I made a bad mistake and Lenny sent me home to think about what I did. But I don't remember what it was so I'm watching TV.
Waylon Smithers,"Well, Lenny's reign of terror is over. Mr. Burns bought the plant back this morning, and..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Enough chit-chat. I need to see Lisa.
Lisa Simpson,"I don't want to talk to you, Mr. Burns."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I think you will. You see, I've just sold the Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant for 120 million dollars!"
Lisa Simpson,Congratulations...
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, don't congratulate me, congratulate Bay State Fish Sticks... as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent of the proceeds."
Bart Simpson,"Lis, have I told you lately that I love you?"
Lisa Simpson,"Wow! I've never seen so much money! Oh, but I can't accept that, knowing where it came from. Can I, Mom?"
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, you do whatever your conscience tells you."
Lisa Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"You did the right thing, sweetheart."
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, that's the first case I've ever seen of a man suffering four simultaneous heart attacks."
Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry, Dad."
Lisa Simpson,"Um, Dad... ten percent of 120 million dollars isn't twelve thousand. It's..."

Hospital Intercom,Code blue... Code blue...

Itchy,Shhhhhh.
Test Blast Announcer,"Cinq, quatre, trois...deux, un... MAINTENANT!"
Bart Simpson,Turn it down! We don't wanna wake up mom and dad!
Nearby Patient,Ssshhhhhh!
Lisa Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Oh my goodness. Kids! Homer! We're late for church! I'm glad I dressed last night.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'd love to go with you, honey, but I've got a lot of work to do around the bed."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, the Lord only asks for an hour a week."
Homer Simpson,"In that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. Lousy God."

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"...and the very same goes for Ezekiel, which brings us back to our starting point, the nine tenets of constancy."
Homer Simpson,DAMMIT!!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"I seem to have lost my place, so I'll start over."
Moe Szyslak,"Aw, for the luvva crumbcake!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Our sermon today is on constancy, inasmuch as the..."
Congregation,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Moreover, by dint of the appreciation of these principles we can learn...the importance of constancy, sweet constancy."
P.A. SYSTEM,
,
Bart Simpson,"Thank you, Lord, for delivering us from Reverend Lovejoy!"
Lisa Simpson,"/ Yahoo! / Oh, man, am I glad to get outta there! / etc."
Marge Simpson,"Hey, calm down. You're wrinkling your church clothes!"
Homer Simpson,Who cares? This is the best part of the week!
Lisa Simpson,It's the longest possible time before more church.
Marge Simpson,Church shouldn't be a chore. It should help you in your daily life.
Moe Szyslak,Barney Gumbel.
Homer Simpson,"It should, but it doesn't. Now who's going with Daddy to the dump?"
Lisa Simpson,Me! Me!
Marge Simpson,The dump?
Homer Simpson,Yeah. We're gonna get rid of the Christmas tree. It's starting to turn brown.
Homer Simpson,Wanna come with?
Marge Simpson,"No, no, I don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
Homer Simpson,It's your life.
Bart Simpson,We'll bring you back something nice.
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Can you believe it? They give you five Q's and only two U's. What a world.
Marge Simpson,It's crazy!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"So what's on your mind, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,"...sermons about ""constancy"" and ""prudissitude"" are all very well and good, but the church could be doing so much more to reach out to people."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, I don't see you volunteering to make things better."
Marge Simpson,Well... okay. I will volunteer!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I wasn't prepared for that.
,
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Christmas tree."
Bart Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Who's up for some scrounging?
Homer Simpson,"Hey, here's a perfectly good basketball half!"
Lisa Simpson,I found a Malibu Stacy with no head!
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! Help me, Lisa!"
Bart Simpson,Lisa! Dad! C'mere quick! There is something that you won't believe!
Lisa Simpson,What the heck is that?
Bart Simpson,Maybe it's a box from the future!
Lisa Simpson,It looks Japanese.
Homer Simpson,Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God, what is that?..."
,
Ned Flanders,I'm meek... but I could probably stand to be meeker.
,
Marge Simpson,"All done! I swept the aisles and put all the collection plates in the dishwasher. Oh, and you wouldn't believe how many dead pigeons there were in the organ."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Marge, you are a real time-saver. Do you know, thanks to you, I've rediscovered a form of shame that's gone unused for 700 years."
Marge Simpson,Wow.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Lovejoy here.
Seymour Skinner,"Reverend, this is Principal Skinner. I'm facing a crisis and I didn't know to whom to turn."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,All right.
Seymour Skinner,"Mother's gone too far. She's put cardboard over her half of the television. We rented ""Man Without a Face"" -- I didn't even know he had a problem. What should I do?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, maybe you should read your Bible."
Seymour Skinner,"Um, any particular passage?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, it's all good."
Seymour Skinner,All right. Thanks anyway.
Marge Simpson,"Reverend, I hate to say this, but it sounded like that poor man was reaching out to you. I'm not sure your advice was all that helpful."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, Marge, I was once idealistic like you. It was the mid-seventies, and I was fresh out of seminary. The Sixties were long over and people were once again ready to feel bad about themselves..."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I came to Springfield ready to roll up my sleeves and help my fellow man.
,
Young Flanders,"Reverend, I'm a... I'm afraid something terrible has happened."
Young Lovejoy,"Well, sit down and rap with me, brother. That's what I'm here for."
Young Flanders,"Well, I was talked into doing a dance called ""the bump"", but my hip slipped and my buttocks came into contact with the buttocks of another young man!"
Young Lovejoy,I... see.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Then the calls began.
,
Ned Flanders,"...Well, I... I think I may be coveting my own wife..."
,
Ned Flanders,I think I swallowed a toothpick.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Finally, I just stopped caring. Luckily by then, it was the 80s and no one noticed."
Marge Simpson,But you can't let a few bad experiences sour you on helping people!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, sure I can."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,You handle it.
Marge Simpson,Me?
Marge Simpson,"No, I... I... Wait, I can't... I-- Hello...?"
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, hi, I'm callin' for Reverend Lovejoy. Who is this?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the Listen Lady!"
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well listen, lady. I've got so many problems, I.... I don't even know where to begin here."
Marge Simpson,"Okay, uh, why don't you start from the top?"
Moe Szyslak,"All rightee... Uh, number one: I've lost the will to live."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's ridiculous, Moe. You've got lots to live for."
Moe Szyslak,"Really? That's not what Reverend Lovejoy's been tellin' me. Wow, you're good. Thanks!"
Moe Szyslak,"Hi, it's me again. I got another problem. Uh, this one's about my cat."
Cat,
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, shut up. I'm asking her."
,
Homer Simpson,Why would you volunteer at the church?
Marge Simpson,I don't know... guilt?
Homer Simpson,"Volunteering is for suckers! Do you know that so-called ""volunteers"" don't even get paid?"
Marge Simpson,"Well, I think volunteering is great. Deep down it makes you feel --"
Marge Simpson,Homer! Will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? It came from the dump.
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I'm obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? How'd my face get on it?!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, if they got a picture of you, that means they can see you. They're probably watching us right now."
Marge Simpson,That's ridiculous. Nobody is watching us right now.

Akira,Hai! Hai! Hai! Bye.
Akira,Hai!
Homer Simpson,"Akira, can you read this for me?"
Barney Gumble,
Akira,"Ah yes, this is a product called ""Mr. Sparkle."" Very popular dish detergent. Hey, he looks like you!"
Lisa Simpson,What's he saying?
Akira,He identifies himself as a magnet for foodstuffs... He boasts that he will banish dirt to the land of wind and ghosts.
Lisa Simpson,Wow.
Akira,"Yes. You have very lucky dishes, Mr. Simpson. This soap is from the sacred forest of Hokkaido. Renowned for its countless soap factories."
Homer Simpson,"Hokkaido, eh?"

Lenny Leonard,"See, all along, I been telling Carl I'm married to a beauty queen. Now he's comin' over for dinner."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Lenny, I'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she looks like."
Lenny Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no, no, it's worse than that. I don't even have a wife. I just said I did to, you know, be a big-shot."
Marge Simpson,"Oh. Well, it's time to start telling the truth. Now, when I have to tell my husband the truth, I cook him a big delicious dinner. By the time he's done eating, he's too full and tired to care what I have to say."
Lenny Leonard,"Wow, that's great! When Carl comes over, I'll stuff him 'til he don't know what's what."
Agnes Skinner,"Seymour, I'm getting tired. Tell them we're going next."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, I'm not principal of the line, mother."
Agnes Skinner,And you never will be.

Homer Simpson,"I'd like the phone book for Hokkaido, Japan, please."

Congregation,"Marge, I need some advice -- / Listen, I've got some trouble with-- / etc."
Marge Simpson,"Please, one at a time, one at a time! Now, who has the most urgent problem?"
Sideshow Mel,I have a recurring dream in which I'm falling.
Congregation,
Marge Simpson,"Come right this way, Mel. I... Tim, hold my calls."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,I'm a shepherd without a flock. What have I done to lose them?
St. Eleutherius,"The real question is, what have you done to keep them?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Ah, St. Eleutherius of Nicomedia."
St. Eleutherius,That's my name -- don't wear it out.
St. Bartholomew,"To inspire men, you must be brave. I introduced Christianity to Mongolia. It didn't take, but it was worth a try."
St. Lucian,"Tell us, good Reverend, what great deeds have you done to inspire the hearts of men?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, I had the vestibule recarpeted."
St. Donickus,"I've appeared in over 8,000 visions, and that's the lamest reply I've ever heard."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh now, please, I... I thought saints were supposed to be friendly."

Marge Simpson,"Hello, Listen Lady."

Helen Lovejoy,"Marge, people say you've got a real knack for solving problems. Well, this is a little awkward, but, um, Tim came home from church so despondent today. He's just been playing with his trains all afternoon."
Marge Simpson,"We all need a little time to ourselves, Helen. Just give him a day or two and I'm sure he'll be back to his old dynamic self."
Helen Lovejoy,Okay.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Attention, H-O scale passengers: the dining car is closed. Root beer is still available but the cost is now $6.50. If the passengers will look to the right, you will see a sad man. That is all."

Lisa Simpson,"Wait, look."
Japanese Announcer,Mr. Sparkle: a joint venture of Matsumura Fishworks...and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, it was all a coincidence!"
Bart Simpson,"Yep. There's your answer, Fish Bulb."
Homer Simpson,"Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. C'mon kids. Let's go home."
Bart Simpson,We are home.
Homer Simpson,That was fast.
Marge Simpson,You've just got to accept it. Your GameBoy is gone. It's at the bottom of the ocean.
Captain Horatio McCallister,Aye. Aye. Aye.
Marge Simpson,Hello. Listen Lady.
Ned Flanders,"Uh, I'm in some hot soup here, Marge. Uh, some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. I... I think they could start slacking at any moment."
Marge Simpson,"Well, Ned, you don't have to stand for that. You just march right up to those youngsters and tell them to vamoose."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, well, if you're sure that'll help..."
DOLPH,"Hey, let's go over to the One-Hour Photo and breathe some fumes."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, excuse me, fellas... I... I couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. If possible."

Marge Simpson,Of course he did.
Maude Flanders,"Really? Oh. Because the thing is, um... mine didn't."
Marge Simpson,Oh my God... Ned!
,
,
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Yes, Marge."
Marge Simpson,"Reverend, I gave Ned Flanders some bad advice. Now he could be in real trouble."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"What happened, now? Did he swallow a paperclip?"
Marge Simpson,"No, he's disappeared. Oh, I'm in way over my head. I mean, where do the helpers turn when they need help?"
Marge Simpson,Sorry.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Marge, why don't you let me handle this?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Hello, church basement."
Ned Flanders,"Yeah, it's Ned Flanders. The teens have been chasing me all night. They finally stopped to gas up their scooters."
Marge Simpson,Ned! Where are you?!
Ned Flanders,"Oh, I can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Eight tenths?
Marge Simpson,Donny's discount gas!
,
Homer Simpson,"Thanks for swinging by the house, Reverend."
Marge Simpson,Donny!
Donny,What?
Marge Simpson,Did you see a man being chased by some young hooligans?
Donny,I see lotsa stuff.
Lisa Simpson,Did you see that?
Donny,Yes.
,
DOLPH,Looks like we lost him.
Jimbo Jones,"Yeah, well, we proved our point. He'll think twice next time he tries to defend his business."
Kearney Zzyzwicz,I'm sleepy. Let's go to school.
,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, they're leaving! The ordeal is over!"
Baboon,
Ned Flanders,
,
Lisa Simpson,Ned! Ned! Mr. Flanders!
Japanese Tourist,He... Mista Sparkaru! Mista Sparkaru!
Homer Simpson,Konichi-wa.
Ned Flanders,
Lisa Simpson,"That came from Baboon County, U.S.A.!"
,
Ned Flanders,Help! What do I do?!
Lisa Simpson,Play dead!
Homer Simpson,"No, run around in circles!"
Bart Simpson,"No, act like a lion!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Swipe at the dominant male! C'mon, Ned, knock that monkey down!"
Zookeeper,Jumping kangaroo rats!
Marge Simpson,You've got to get him out of there!
Zookeeper,"Geez, I'd like to, but if they don't kill the intruder, it's really bad for their society..."
Bart Simpson,They're gonna kill him?
Zookeeper,Eventually. First they'll eat his skin.
Lisa Simpson,
Baboons,Ook. Ook.
Ned Flanders,Tell Maude I want a fancy funeral. Big coffin. Lotsa jewels.
Lisa Simpson,"Look, it's Reverend Lovejoy!"
Marge Simpson,Thank heavens!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Entrust your hand to mine, Ned!"
Ned Flanders,
Baboons,Ook! Ook!
Ned Flanders,"Oh, oh, thank the Lord! He's truly watching over--"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Say your prayers, you heathen baboons!"
Bart Simpson,Wow.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, those poor monkeys."
Marge Simpson,They started it!
Ned Flanders,"You saved me, Reverend. You really went above and beyond. Thank you!"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, don't thank me -- thank Marge Simpson. She taught me that there's more to being a minister than not caring about people."
Ned Flanders,Amen.
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"...Baboons to the left of me, baboons to the right, the speeding locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs. A pair of the great apes rose up at me, but BIFF! BAM! I sent them flying like two hairy footballs. A third came screaming at me And that's when I got mad..."
Homer Simpson,Now that's religion.
Kent Brockman,"...which, if true, means death for us all."
Kent Brockman,"And now, ""Kent's People"". Tonight's inspiring story is about Frank Grimes, a 35-year-old Springfieldite who's earned everything the hard way, but never let adversity get him down."
Frank Grimes,Any office supply company can have them made up for you.
Homer Simpson,Can I have this one?
Kent Brockman,"Abandoned by his parents at age four, Frank never got to go to school. He spent his childhood years as a delivery boy, delivering toys to more fortunate children."
Kent Brockman,"Then, on his 18th birthday, he was blown up in a silo explosion."
Kent Brockman,"During his long recuperation he taught himself to hear and feel pain again. As the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day to study science by mail."
Kent Brockman,"And last week, Frank Grimes, the man who had to struggle for everything he ever got, received his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics -- with a minor in determination."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"That's the kind of man I need on my team, Smithers. A real scrapper. A self-made man like me. Bring this Grimes fellow to me. I want to make him my executive vice president."
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television. He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car, then pushed a criminal in front of it. Find this dog. I want to make him my executive vice president."
Waylon Smithers,"Uh... yes, sir. In the meantime, here's Frank Grimes."
Waylon Smithers,Th-- the self-made man?
C. Montgomery Burns,"What? Oh, yes. That fellow. Well, just put him somewhere out of the way and find that dog."
Waylon Smithers,"Yes, sir."
Homer Simpson,Chair goes round... chair goes round.
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, Homer, ya busy?"
Homer Simpson,Yes.
Carl Carlson,There's a new guy at the plant.
Carl Carlson,"Uh, maybe we oughta say ""Hi"" to him."
Homer Simpson,I don't know. I'm kind of dizzy. I should probably go home sick.
Carl Carlson,You new?
Frank Grimes,Yes. My name is Frank Grimes.
Lenny Leonard,I'm Lenny. This is Carl and Homer. I'm Lenny.
Frank Grimes,How do you do.
Homer Simpson,Wow. You've got pencils with your name on 'em. Just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.
Frank Grimes,"Oh, that's my degree in nuclear physics. I'm sure you all have one."
Lenny Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Carl and I each have a masters. 'Course old Homer, he didn't need a degree. He just showed up the day they opened the plant."
Homer Simpson,I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
Frank Grimes,"Um... Yeah... Well, listen, I'm... sure we all have a lot of work to do."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."
Frank Grimes,"Uh, I don't think we're being paid to sleep."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya."
Frank Grimes,Huh.
,
Marge Simpson,"""MARGE"" is already taken? Oh, how about ""MARJORIE""?"
City Employee,"Sorry, ma'am."
Marge Simpson,"How about...""MITZI""?"
City Employee,"Uh-uh... Uh, you can have ""NITZI""."
Marge Simpson,"Hmmm... ""NITZI""..."
Bart Simpson,I'm outta here.
Auctioneer,Ladies and gentlemen our next lot is number Seven Fifty-One. How much am I bid for Item Seven Fifty-One -- Seven Five One? Nothing? No bids for Item Seven Fifty-One?
Bart Simpson,A buck!
Auctioneer,"I have a buck. I have one dollar, one dollar here one dollar one here one dollar do I have two? Sold for a buck!"
Bart Simpson,Cool! What'd I buy?
Auctioneer,35 Industry Way.
,
Bart Simpson,Looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off.
,
Homer Simpson,"Hiya, Stretch! What's the good word?"
Frank Grimes,"My name is Grimes, uh, Simpson. Frank Grimes. I took the trouble to learn your name. The least you can do is learn mine."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, Grimy!"
Frank Grimes,You're eating my special dietetic lunch.
Homer Simpson,Huh?
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry."
Frank Grimes,The bag was clearly marked. Please be more careful in the future.
Homer Simpson,Check.
Frank Grimes,"Simpson, do you know who chewed my..."
,
Bart Simpson,Wow! It's filthy... and it's mine.
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,"So how's it going, Grimy?"
Frank Grimes,"I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, Simpson."
Homer Simpson,"I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME / TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL! So what's new, Grimy?"
Frank Grimes,Simpson! You've got a 513!
Frank Grimes,No! A 513! In your procedures manual! A 513?!
Frank Grimes,Look at your control panel!
Homer Simpson,Oh. A five THIRTEEN. I'll handle it.
Homer Simpson,That got it.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse! You want a job in my factory?"
Milhouse Van Houten,You don't have a factory.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, I'm a busy man. You want a job or not?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Okay!
,
Frank Grimes,"God, he eats like a pig!"
Lenny Leonard,I dunno. Pigs tend to chew. I'd say he eats more like a duck.
Frank Grimes,"Well, some kind of farm animal, anyway. And earlier today, I saw him asleep inside a radiation suit! Can you imagine that? He was hanging from a coat hook!"
Lenny Leonard,He had three beers at lunch. That would make anybody sleepy.
Frank Grimes,I've never seen him do any work around here. Wh... what is his job?
Lenny Leonard,Safety inspector.
Frank Grimes,"That irresponsible oaf? A man who, by all rights, should have been killed dozens of times by now?"
Lenny Leonard,"Eh, three hundred sixteen times, by my count."
Frank Grimes,That's the man who's in charge of our safety? It boggles the mind.
Carl Carlson,It's best not to think about it.
Frank Grimes,You idiot! You nearly drank a beaker full of sulfuric acid!
Homer Simpson,"Acid, eh? Gee, that would have been stupid. Boy would my face have been red!"
Frank Grimes,"Stop laughing, you imbecile! Don't you realize how close you just came to killing yourself?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Who did this to my wall?
Homer Simpson,He did.
C. Montgomery Burns,Is this true?
Frank Grimes,"I-- well-- uh, technically it is true, Sir, but..."
C. Montgomery Burns,Come with me.
Homer Simpson,He likes you.
C. Montgomery Burns,How dare you destroy my valuable wall and spill my priceless acid?! Did you really think you were going to get away with it?
Frank Grimes,I wasn't...
C. Montgomery Burns,Silence! I'm going to give you one more chance -- at a reduced salary. So straighten up and fly right!
Frank Grimes,"But, Sir, if I could..."
Homer Simpson,"Hi, Grimy, old buddy."
Frank Grimes,"I'm not your buddy, Simpson. I don't like you. In fact, I hate you. Stay the hell away from me! Because from now on... we're enemies!"
Homer Simpson,Okay. Do I have to do anything?
Frank Grimes,
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't believe it. I've got an enemy. Me! The most beloved man in Springfield."
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, it's a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither."
Homer Simpson,"No, I won't accept that."
Moe Szyslak,"No, it's true. I've got their names written down right here, in what I call my, uh, ""enemies list""."
Barney Gumble,"Jane Fonda, Daniel Schorr, Jack Anderson... Hey, this is Richard Nixon's enemies list! You just crossed out his name and put yours."
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, gimme that. Gimme it back!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, what'll I do, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he's not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye."
Homer Simpson,Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
Moe Szyslak,There's always a first time.
,
Homer Simpson,This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimy and me are going to be friends. Lisa -- be perfect.
Lisa Simpson,Okay.
Homer Simpson,Marge -- perfect. Bart -- perfect. Other kid -- perfect.
Marge Simpson,I only have five lobsters. Are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
Homer Simpson,"No, no. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here."
,
Marge Simpson,"Calm down, Homer. Calm down. Answer the door."
Homer Simpson,Welcome-to-the-Simpson-residence-or-Casa-De-Simpson-as-I-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.
Frank Grimes,"Yeah. What did you want to see me about, Simpson? This better be important."
Homer Simpson,It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.
Homer Simpson,"This is my wife, Marge..."
Marge Simpson,Hello.
Homer Simpson,"... and our beautiful baby. My daughter, Lisa -- I.Q. 156."
Lisa Simpson,Hi.
Homer Simpson,"See. And my son, Bart -- he owns a factory downtown."
,
Homer Simpson,I 'unno. Don't ask me how the economy works.
Frank Grimes,"Yeah, but look at the size of this place. I-I-I live in a single room, above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley."
Homer Simpson,Wow.
Frank Grimes,"I... I'm sorry, isn't that...?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's me all right. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. And this is when I was on tour with The Smashing Pumpkins. Oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space."
Frank Grimes,You. Went into outer space. You.
Homer Simpson,Sure. You've never been?
Homer Simpson,Would you like to see my Grammy Award?
Frank Grimes,"No! I wouldn't Gaw, I've had to work hard every day of my life. And what do I have to show for it? This briefcase, and this haircut. And what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?"
Homer Simpson,What?
Frank Grimes,"Everything! -- A dream house, two cars, a beautiful wife, a son who owns a factory, fancy clothes, and lobsters for dinner. And do you deserve any of it? No!"
Homer Simpson,What are you saying?
Frank Grimes,"I'm saying you're what's wrong with America, Simpson. You coast through life, you do as little as possible and you leech off decent, hard-working people like me. Ha. If you lived in any other country in the world you'd have starved to death long ago."
Bart Simpson,"He's got you there, Dad."
Frank Grimes,You're a fraud. A... a total fraud.
Frank Grimes,It was nice meeting you.
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow! Adding machines! Industrial waste! What should we do with all this stuff, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,I think we both know the answer to that..
Bart Simpson,Get to work.
Bart Simpson,Wacky shack!
Milhouse Van Houten,"Better be careful, Bart. Look at those warning signs."
Bart Simpson,"Solve your problem, Milhouse?"
Milhouse Van Houten,Yep.
,
Marge Simpson,Homer...
Marge Simpson,"Homer, why aren't you at work?"
Homer Simpson,The car won't start. And I don't feel very good today. I am at work.
Marge Simpson,"You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?"
Homer Simpson,"Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road."
,
,
Marge Simpson,"You'll have to face him sometime. And when you do, I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are."
Homer Simpson,No he won't. He hates me.
Marge Simpson,He doesn't hate you. He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, that's his problem. He's a nut. It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe... but I'll bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more... professional in your work."
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,Just a little more... Then he won't have any reason to resent you.
Homer Simpson,I'll do it. To professionalism!
,
Homer Simpson,"Good morning, fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson."
Frank Grimes,Can you believe that guy? He's in his office making a pathetic attempt to look professional.
Carl Carlson,"Hey, whaddya got against Homer, anyway?"
Frank Grimes,Are you kidding? Does this whole plant have some disease where it can't see that he's an idiot? Look here:
Frank Grimes,"Accidents have doubled every year since he became safety inspector. And meltdowns have tripled. Has he been fired? No. Has he been disciplined? No, no."
Lenny Leonard,"Aw, everybody makes mistakes. That's why they put erasers on pencils."
Carl Carlson,Yeah. Homer's okay. Give him a break.
Frank Grimes,"No! Homer is not ""okay"". And I want everyone in this plant to realize it. I would die a happy man if I could prove to you that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a six-year-old."
Lenny Leonard,"So, how you doin'?"
Frank Grimes,"Oh, here we go."
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am."
Homer Simpson,"Lenny, tell Mr. Burns I've gone home to work on the contest."
Frank Grimes,Oh God!
Lisa Simpson,Can I go downstairs and see what Dad's doing?
Marge Simpson,"I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?"
,
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, boy! Quittin' time!"
Bart Simpson,"Just a minute, Van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesn't get trashed. How'd you like to be night watchman?"
Milhouse Van Houten,"But, I'm sleepy."
Bart Simpson,"Ah, no problemo. Here's a nickel for the coffee machine."
Milhouse Van Houten,So this is my life... At least I've done better than Dad.
Bart Simpson,"Aw, geez!"
Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, how could you let this happen? You were supposed to be the night watchman."
Milhouse Van Houten,I was watching. I saw the whole thing. First it started falling over. Then it fell over.
Bart Simpson,Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go.
Moe Szyslak,"Okay, everybody tuck your pants into your socks."
,
C. Montgomery Burns,"...and the bold, new ideas these tiny tykes unveil for us today could make thousands of jobs like yours obsolete!"
Waylon Smithers,Our first little genius is Ralph Wiggum.
Waylon Smithers,"It's pretty good, sir."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Hot tub? Media room? It's supposed to be a power plant, not Aunt Beulah's Bordello. Thank you. Get out. Next."
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, Ralphy, get off the stage! Sweetheart!"
Martin Prince,"Behold! The power plant of the future, today!"
C. Montgomery Burns,Too cold and sterile. Where's the heart?
Martin Prince,But it really generates power. It's lighting this room right now.
C. Montgomery Burns,You lose! Get off my property!
C. Montgomery Burns,Let's have the next child.
Frank Grimes,"Look, everybody! Simpson's in a contest with children!"
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, shhh!"
Carl Carlson,You're making us miss the contest.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Could you explain your model, young man?"
Frank Grimes,What's to explain?! He's an idiot!
Lenny Leonard,Pipe down!
Homer Simpson,"Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now..."
C. Montgomery Burns,
Homer Simpson,Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance. And this racing stripe here I feel is pretty sharp.
C. Montgomery Burns,Agreed. First prize.
Frank Grimes,What?!
Carl Carlson,"Way to go, Homer!"
Lenny Leonard,"You're number one, Homer!"
,
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, and Homer beat their brains out!"
Frank Grimes,"Oh, I can't stand it any longer! This whole plant is insane! Insane, I tell you!"
Frank Grimes,"I can be lazy, too! Look at me!"
Frank Grimes,Hi! I'm a worthless employee just like Homer Simpson! Give me a promotion!
Frank Grimes,"Oooh, I eat like a slob but nobody minds!"
Frank Grimes,I'm peeing on the seat. Give me a raise?!
Frank Grimes,"Now I'm returning to work without washing my hands. But it doesn't matter, because I'm Homer Simpson!"
Frank Grimes,"I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. D'oh d'oh d'oh!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, you okay, Grimy?"
Frank Grimes,I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson,You wish.
Frank Grimes,"Oh, hi, Mr. Burns, I'm the worst worker in the world! Time to go home to my mansion and eat my lobster!"
Frank Grimes,"What's this? ""Extremely high voltage""? Well, I don't need safety gloves because I'm Homer Simp..."
,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Frank Grimes, or ""Grimy"" as he liked to be called, taught us that a man can triumph over adversity. And even though Frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short, I'm sure he's looking down..."
Homer Simpson,"Change the channel, Marge."
Crowd,
Lenny Leonard,That's our Homer!
,
Troy McClure,"""Spin-off!""... Is there any word more thrilling to the human soul? Hi, I'm Troy McClure! You may remember me from such TV spin-offs as ""Son of Sanford and Son"" and ""AfterMANNIX."""
Troy McClure,"I'm here at the Museum of TV and Television with a real treat for ""Simpsons"" fans, if any, because tonight we present... ""The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase!"""
Troy McClure,"Not long ago, the FOX network approached the producers of ""The Simpsons"" with a simple request: thirty-five new shows to fill a few holes in their programming line-up."
Troy McClure,"That's a pretty daunting task! And the producers weren't up to it. Instead, they churned out three ""Simpsons"" spin-offs, transplanting already popular characters into new locales and situations. First up: a gritty crime drama starring Springfield's beloved Police Chief Wiggum. Keep at least one eye open, 'cause his best friends the Simpsons just might pop in to wish him luck. Let's us wish him luck, too! Good luck, Wiggum!"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Ahhh, New Orleans. The Big Easy. Sweet Lady Gumbo. Old Swampy..."
Seymour Skinner,"I still don't understand, Clancy. Why give up your job as a small town police chief to set up a detective shop in New Orleans?"
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, lotsa reasons, I s'pose. Got kicked off the force, for one thing."
Seymour Skinner,For massive corruption.
Chief Wiggum,For massive corr... Exactly.
Seymour Skinner,"Yeah. As for me, I was born and bred here in the mean streets of ""N'Awlins."" Oh, sure, I left briefly to take that principal's job in Springfield, but in my heart I... I've always been a small-time hustler."
Chief Wiggum,"I know. That's precisely why I hired you as my leg man, Skinny Boy. I want you to put the word out: Chief Wiggum is here to clean up this crime dump!"
Chief Wiggum,Bleh.
Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. Looks like you've already got an enemy, Chief. Y'know, folks 'round here don't much care for law and order types."
Chief Wiggum,Is that right? Well maybe they'll change their minds once I arrest them for throwing skulls all over my floor.
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, man, what a day. It's no cakewalk being a single parent, juggling a career and a family like so many juggling balls -- two, I s'pose."
Ralph Wiggum,"Daddy, these rubber pants are hot."
Chief Wiggum,"You wear 'em until you learn, son."
,
Portly Chef,I gar-ohn-tee!
Seymour Skinner,Will you stop saying that.
Chief Wiggum,"So, Skinner, who do you figure threw that skull through my window? What's the word on the street?"
Seymour Skinner,"Well, to be honest, Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years. Although... according to an article I read in Parade Magazine, a criminal by the name of ""Big Daddy"" runs this town."
Chief Wiggum,"Big Daddy, eh? Well, he won't feel so big if he messes with Chief Wiggum, P.I., again. Which I sincerely doubt he will."
,
,
Chief Wiggum,"Hey... Oh, God!"
Seymour Skinner,"Lucky for you, this was just a warning gator. The next one won't be corked."
Chief Wiggum,"Listen up, Big Daddy! You don't scare me! I'm three steps ahead of you--"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Chief? Your boy's been kidnapped."
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, God!"
Seymour Skinner,"Big Daddy's trademark calling card. See, it's right here inside the skull."
Chief Wiggum,"Looks like we've got our first case ever, Skinny Boy. And this time, it's personal!"
Announcer,"""Chief Wiggum, P.I."" will return... right now."
,
Chief Wiggum,Who is this?
Seymour Skinner,"It's me, Chief. I'm on the other extension."
Big Daddy,"Now you listen up, mon ami, and you listen good, heah? De name's Daddy. Charles Daddy."
Chief Wiggum,"Big Daddy! What've you done with my boy, Daddy?"
Big Daddy,"Ah, de boy's fine, so far. I taught him to play de spoons."
Big Daddy,"...If y'evah want to see dat boy again, I suggest y' leave town today, heah?"
Chief Wiggum,"Heh... Sounded like some sort of party going on in the background. Are there any parties today, Skinner?"
,
Seymour Skinner,"Eh, it's not really a party town. Though if I remember correctly, they occasionally hold a function called Mardi... something."
,
Scary Huge-headed Figure,
Lisa Simpson,
Chief Wiggum,"Well, if it isn't my old friends from Springfield, the Simpsons! What brings you folks to New Orleans?"
Bart Simpson,"Mardi Gras, man! When the Big Easy calls, ya gotta accept the charges!"
Lisa Simpson,"Chief Wiggum, I can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy adventures you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop!"
Chief Wiggum,"Well, golly, I'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. You haven't seen him, have you? Caucasian male, between the ages of six and ten, thinning hair?"
Homer Simpson,Over there.
Ralph Wiggum,"Look, Big Daddy! It's regular daddy!"
Big Daddy,"De Chief! Ooh. I suppose I best to run. Lord o' mercy, I wish I weren't so fat."
,
,
,
Chief Wiggum,Police business!
Chief Wiggum,"Hang on, son! I'm coming to-- OW!!! Ow. Geez, my tongue!"
Chief Wiggum,"Hah, hah, nyah, nyah."
,
Chief Wiggum,Whaddya suppose the rent is on a hideout like that?
Seymour Skinner,"Ah, it's not rented, Chief -- it's stolen. That's the Louisiana Governor's mansion. It's been missing for eight months."
,
,
Big Daddy,"Welcome to ma maison, Chief. Ah've been expecting you."
Chief Wiggum,"Is that so, Big Daddy? Well expect this: the arrest of you by me."
Big Daddy,"Mais cher, New Orleans is ma town! Won't nobody gonna mess with me. I got interests, and I ain't talking 'bout stamp collecting. Though I do find that extremely interesting."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, yeah? Well that makes two of us."
Big Daddy,"Y'know, boys, dere's an old sayin' down on de bayou dat, um -- BLAH!"
Seymour Skinner,"He's gradually getting away, Chief."
Barney Gumble,Thanks for the lift!
Chief Wiggum,"Ah, let him go. I have a feeling we'll meet again, each and every week. Always in more sexy and exciting ways."
Ralph Wiggum,"Daddy, when I grow up, I wanna be just like you."
Seymour Skinner,"Better start eating, kid."
Chief Wiggum,Start eating?!
Ralph Wiggum,
Ralph Wiggum,I didn't mean it that way...
Ralph Wiggum,

Troy McClure,"Oh, hi! Welcome back to our Spin-off Showcase. Could ""The Simpsons"" ever have maintained its popularity without Moe the Bartender? Let's hope so, because Moe's leaving to do his own sitcom. But don't panic: he's taking a familiar sidekick with him, and his best friend Homer might just pop in to wish him luck. Let's take a peek..."
,
Barney Gumble,"Well, ah, I better go. I've got a date with that lady in front of the drug store who's always yelling things."
Moe Szyslak,She told me she was washin' her hair tonight. I'm so desperately lonely.
Grampa Simpson,"Ah, quit your belly-aching, ya big loser!"
Moe Szyslak,Wh... who said that?
Grampa Simpson,"I did. It's me, Abe Simpson."
Moe Szyslak,But you're dea-d-d-dead.
Grampa Simpson,I was! But I've come back... as your love testing machine!
Grampa Simpson,I'm the love-matic Grampa!
Moe Szyslak,
Singers,WHILE SHOPPING FOR SOME CANS / AN OLD MAN PASSED AWAY / HE FLOATED UP TOWARD HEAVEN / BUT GOT LOST ALONG THE WAY...
Singers,NOW HE'S THE LOVE-MATIC GRAMPA! / THE WISE SOCRATIC GRAMPA! / AND HE'LL FILL OUR HEARTS WITH LOVE!
Grampa Simpson,"Don't be afraid, Moe. I'm here to help you with your romantic problems."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I don't need no advice from no pinball machine. I'll have you know I wrote the book on love."
Grampa Simpson,"Yeah -- ""All Quiet On The Western Front!"""
Moe Szyslak,"Ahh, kiss my dishrag!"
Grampa Simpson,See? That's your problem. You're a crab. Ladies like sweet talkers.
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I'm sweet. I'm sweeter than Jewish wine."
Homer Simpson,"Barney, where's my car?!!"
Grampa Simpson,Then prove it. I want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.
Homer Simpson,"Ah, grrrreetings!"
Grampa Simpson,"Son, it's me! I floated up toward heaven, but got lost along the way!"
,
Grampa Simpson,"Darn tootin', ya lousy fink! You buried me naked and sold my suit to buy a ping-pong table! What kind of a son--"
Homer Simpson,Call me when you get a karaoke machine.
Grampa Simpson,That's the second time he pulled the plug on me.
Betty,I was just in a car accident. Can I use your phone?
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, usin' the phone's a four-drink minimum."
Grampa Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,What's the matter? I'm making as nice as I can.
Grampa Simpson,Test- lady. Test-lady.
Moe Szyslak,G'ahead. Give it a try.
Moe Szyslak,It goes by how clammy your hands are.
Betty,"Well, I suppose I could use a laugh after that accident."
Grampa Simpson,Lovelorn. You-need-man. Moe-near-now. Go-near- Moe.
Betty,What?
Moe Szyslak,"""Go near Moe."" I'd say that's a pretty strong endorsement. So, how about you and me go out sometime? You know, out back."
Grampa Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"I mean, uh, out to dinner at a fancy French restaurant?"
Grampa Simpson,
Betty,"Sounds great. And if this Love Tester's as accurate as it looks, maybe we'll be having breakfast, too."
Moe Szyslak,"You did it, Grampa! You really are a love expert."
Grampa Simpson,"Dang right! Fact is, I invented kissing. It was during World War One, and they were looking for a new way to spread germs..."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Grampa, but I gotta stash you in the bathroom so Betty won't get wise to us."
Grampa Simpson,This is not the evening I envisioned.
Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, she just got here. Give me some advice, quick."
Grampa Simpson,"Well, uh, y'know, just be sweet. Pour on the honey. You know."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, romantic. ""Ain't sunshine pretty?"" ""Ain't flowers stupid?"" I gotcha."
Grampa Simpson,I've suffered so long. Why can't I die?
,
Moe Szyslak,"You know what's great about you, Betty, is you're letting your looks go gracefully. You're not all hung up on looking ""attractive"" and ""desirable"". It's just so rare and refreshing."
Betty,"So, Moe, tell me a little about yourself."
Moe Szyslak,"Myself? Oh, geez. Um, I gotta go to the can again. I got the runs."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, get away from that! Leave him alone!"
Kearney Zzyzwicz,It said I was gay!
Moe Szyslak,"You all right, Grampa?"
Grampa Simpson,"Ohh... ""Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true..."""
Moe Szyslak,Willya quit yer clownin'?! I need help here.
Grampa Simpson,"Well, tell her her rump's as big as a queen's and twice as fragrant."
Moe Szyslak,Okay...
Moe Szyslak,"You are absolutely, positively the dumbest haunted love tester that I have ever met!"
Betty,What is going on in here?
Moe Szyslak,"Um, ah, oh, g... I might as well come clean with ya. I ain't too good at talking to women, and... and I really wanted to do ya, so I brought along the love tester to help me. As you may have guessed, it's inhabited by the ghost of my friend's dead father."
Betty,"Why you conniving, devious, monstrous, despicable, sweet little angel."
Moe Szyslak,"Look, Betty, if you just give me a chance... Whh-aaaattt??!!"
Betty,I can't believe you went to all that trouble for me!
Grampa Simpson,
BETTY & MOE,"Thanks, Grampa!"
Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. Now howzabout introducin' me to that cute little pay phone out front?"
MOE & BETTY,
Singers,HE'S THE LOVE-MATIC GRAMPA / AND HE FILLED OUR HEARTS WITH LOOOVE!

Troy McClure,"Welcome back. I'm talking with the Curator of the Museum of TV and Television, Mr. John Winslow."
Marge Simpson,"Hello, dear. How was work at the plant?"
Troy McClure,"In our final spin-off tonight, the Simpson family finally gets the chance to show off the full range of their talents. Unfortunately, one family member didn't want that chance and refused to participate, but thanks to some creative casting, you won't even notice. Show us what ya got, TV!"
,
,
Family,COME ALONG AND BRING THE FAMILY / COME ALONG AND JOIN THE FUN / COME ALONG AND JOIN THE FAMILY / JOIN THE FAMILY SIMP-SON! ROLL CALL!!
Marge Simpson,REMEMBER ME? MY NAME IS MARGE! / THE TV MOM WHOSE HAIR IS LARGE!
Bart Simpson,"STEP BACK, MOM! IT'S BART'S TURN NOW! / EAT MY SHORTS! DON'T HAVE A COW!"
Lisa,"I'M LISA -- PEPPY, BLONDE, AND STUNNING! / SOPHOMORE PROM QUEEN FIVE YEARS RUNNING! GOOOOOO LISA!"
Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute! Whoa, whoa! Stop the music! Where's Dad?"
Lisa,Here he is!
Homer Simpson,I'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
Marge Simpson,Ghost? What ghost?
Homer Simpson,"B-b-before the show, you said we were having a Special Ghost tonight!"
Marge Simpson,I said we were having a special guest tonight -- Mr. Tim Conway.
Audience,
Homer Simpson,What's a Tim Conway?
Tim Conway,"Oh, about 120 pounds!"
Audience,
Family,IT'S THE SIMPSON FAMILY SMILE-TIME VARIETY HOOOOUR!
Marge Simpson,"You know Homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?"
Marge Simpson,Yes! And it might look something like this...
Homer Simpson,"Honey, I'm home!"
Homer Simpson,"It's not a plant, Marge, it's a tree, and I've nearly chewed through it. Now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight."
Marge Simpson,I know. And I made your favorite --
Marge Simpson,Stakes!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, would you two close the dam door?"
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Bart Simpson,But that's where we live -- a dam.
Marge Simpson,
Lisa,"Look everybody, Maggie got her first tooth!"
Audience,
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Now, before my boss comes, there's something important you should know --"
Marge Simpson,"In a minute, Homie. I have to get the door."
Homer Simpson,"But, Marge...!"
Audience,
Marge Simpson,
Tim Conway,"Oh, was it something I said?"
Captain Horatio McCallister,Arr! Someone should be keel-hauled for that one!
Judge Snyder,I move that the last sketch be stricken from the record. Now bring in the next offender...
,
Marge Simpson,"Inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, I know one thing in this world that's still pure and good."
Marge Simpson,Christian love?
Homer Simpson,"No... Candy! Sweet, sweet candy."
Homer Simpson,I WANT CANDY!
Marge Simpson,But don't you want to end world famine?
Bart Simpson,I WANT CANDY!
Marge Simpson,Or save the endangered Alaskan salmon?
Lisa,I WANT CANDY!
Marge Simpson,"Well, if you won't think of society's ills..."
Homer Simpson,I WANT CANDY!
Marge Simpson,At least think of our dentist bills!
Lisa,GOT A NEW DANCE AND IT GOES LIKE THIS / AND THE NAME OF THE DANCE IS THE PEPPERMINT TWIST! YEAH!
Jasper Beardly,"LOLLIPOP, LOLLIPOP, OH LOLLY-LOLLYPOP. LOLLIPOP!"
Waylon Smithers,CRACK THAT WHIP! LICORICE WHIP! I SAID WHIP IT! LICORICE WHIP!
All,WE WANT CANDY! / WE WANT CANDY!
All,CANDY!!
All,
Audience,
Hans Moleman,A Poem. By Hans Moleman. I think that I shall never see / My cataracts are blinding me.
Tim Conway,And they thought I stunk!
Marge Simpson,"Well, it's time to say ""good night."""
Homer Simpson,I wish our special guest Tim Conway didn't have to leave so soon.
Tim Conway,I'm still here. FOX wouldn't spring for a decent hotel room.
Audience,
Marge Simpson,"He's just kidding. We'd like to thank FOX, and the good people at Budget Lodge."
Homer Simpson,"Well, that's all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying: ""As you walk down the road of life..."""
Bart Simpson,Hitchhike -- it's faster!
Lisa,Ba-art!
Marge Simpson,We're like this all the time!
Family,"Good night, everybody!"
,
Troy McClure,"And that's it for our Spin-off Showcase. But what about the show that started it all? How do you keep ""The Simpsons"" fresh and funny after eight long years? Well, here's what's on tap for Season Nine:"
Troy McClure,Magic powers!
Troy McClure,Wedding after wedding after wedding!
Troy McClure,"And did someone say ""long-lost triplets""?"
Troy McClure,"So join America's favorite TV family... and a tiny green space alien named Osmodiar that only Homer can see...on FOX this fall. It'll be out-of-this-world! Right, Osmodiar?"
Ozmodiar,"Damn straight, Troy, my man!"
OSMODIAR AND TROY,"Goodnight, America!"
,
Chief Wiggum,"Sorry, sorry. Boy, it's getting harder and harder to make it here by ten."
Chief Wiggum,We'll start the tour in a second. I just gotta check the answering machine.
Chief Wiggum,"Aw, can't anybody in this town take the law into their own hands?"
,
Chief Wiggum,Gather 'round kids. We're about to enter the museum...
Kids,
Chief Wiggum,...of Crime!
Kids,
Chief Wiggum,"Now, what I am about to show you next may shock and educate you. Hold on to your values as we step through the looking glass into a hippie pot party!"
Chief Wiggum,"While Johnny Welfare plays acid rock on a stolen guitar, his old lady has a better idea."
Kids,
Chief Wiggum,"That's right, she's got the ""munchies"" for a ""California Cheeseburger."""
,
Narrator,"So the next time you're walking on the beach, enjoying an hourglass, or making cheap, low-grade windshields -- think where we'd be without... sand."
Chorus,SAND! SAND! SAND!!
Miss Hoover,"Okay, that was the sand movie. Now it'll just take me a second to set up our next movie."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Miss Hoover, movies are a nice break, but couldn't we be doing something a little more challenging?"
Miss Hoover,Probably.
Announcer,"The moon. For several years, she has fascinated many. But will man ever walk on her fertile surface? Democratic hopeful Adlai Stevenson says so."
Adlai Stevenson,I have no objection to man walking on the moon.
Announcer,"By 1964, experts say man will have established 12 colonies on the moon, ideal for family vacations."
Announcer,"Once there, you'll weigh only a small percentage of what you weigh on Earth."
Announcer,"Slow down, tubby! You're not on the moon yet."
Announcer,The moon belongs to America -- and anxiously awaits the arrival of our astromen. Will YOU be among them?
Ralph Wiggum,"Miss Hoover, the movie's over."
Lisa Simpson,Where's Miss Hoover?
JANEY,"Hey, her car's gone."
Ralph Wiggum,Maybe she drove to the moon.
Homer Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"It's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of ""magazine time."" I just don't feel challenged."
Seymour Skinner,"Of course we could make things more challenging, Lisa, but then the stupider students would be in here complaining... furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation..."
Lisa Simpson,
,
Chief Wiggum,"We're now in the Communications Room or the ""ComRoo"". Uh, this is a police radio, the single most important piece of equipment in the ComRoo. As you can see, some of the boys like to put their banana stickers all over it. Uh, there's Chiquita, there's Del Monte, there's a BananCo, Gorilla's Choice..."
Kids,
Chief Wiggum,"Now, uh, everyone follow me to my chair, where I just need to get off my feet for a few minutes."
Chief Wiggum,Ahhhhh... Ohhhhh... I won't be getting up soon.
Bart Simpson,Testing...
Bart Simpson,Testing...
Bart Simpson,Hmm. Hmm. Hey...
,
Bart Simpson,
Bart Simpson,Testing...
Parrots,Testing! Testing!
Parrots,
Homer Simpson,
,
,
Lisa Simpson,When do you expect the ringing will stop?!
,
,
Marge Simpson,"Now, about your punishment, young man."
Bart Simpson,"I know, I'll go to my room and think about what I did."
Homer Simpson,"No, no! Your room is full of toys. You're going to the, uh, garage!"
Bart Simpson,You're the boss.
Marge Simpson,"I tell you, Chief, I just don't know what we're going to do with him."
Teacher #1,But the truth can be harsh and disturbing. How can that be considered beautiful?
Chief Wiggum,"You know, you do have options. For example, there are behavior modifying drugs. How wedded are you to the Bart you know?"
Homer Simpson,Not very.
Marge Simpson,No! No drugs. Bart just needs a little discipline.
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, what about military school? It set my brother straight. Now he owns and operates a famous cave."
Marge Simpson,"You know, maybe Chief Wiggum is right. Military school is a good idea."
Bart Simpson,"Wow, I can't believe we're going to Disneyland! Hey, where's all your luggage?"
Seymour Skinner,
Seymour Skinner,"Edna, your tears say more than words ever could."
,
Bart Simpson,Military school?! You lied to me!
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm sorry if you heard ""Disneyland"", but I distinctly said ""military school."""
,
Commandant,...And that's how we'll mold your boy into a productive member of society through an intensive program of push-ups and formation marching.
Marge Simpson,"Well, it certainly was nice of you to accept Bart in the middle of the semester."
Commandant,"Fortunately, we've had a couple of recent ""freak-outs,"" so that freed up a couple of bunks."
Bart Simpson,Freak-outs?
Homer Simpson,"If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?"
,
Commandant,Our high standards challenge students to reach their full potential.
Lisa Simpson,Look at how disciplined they are. They're just like the Terra Cotta Warriors of Xian.
Homer Simpson,They sure are.
Cadet,"Ouch! Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
Homer Simpson,That's not so disciplined.
Commandant,"They're just children, Mr. Simpson."
Homer Simpson,I guess.
Cadet Larsen,"Truth is beauty, beauty truth, Sir!!"
,
Marge Simpson,"Well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
Bart Simpson,"Please don't make me stay, Dad! I'll do anything you say! I'll find religion! I'll be good sometimes!"
Homer Simpson,Leggo my leg.
Bart Simpson,No!
Homer Simpson,"Son, for the last time, you're staying at military school."
Lisa Simpson,And so am I!
Lisa Simpson,This school has everything I ever wanted.
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, no! This place is just a jail for children."
Bart Simpson,No jail can hold me!
Commandant,"All right, let's go over this one more time, just to make sure I understand the situation. You're a girl?"
Lisa Simpson,Yes.
,
Lisa Simpson,All I want is a chance to prove myself.
Commandant,"Mmm, in our 185 years, we have never had a female cadet. But that seems to be the way the wind is blowing these days. After all, we have female singers, female motorists... Welcome aboard."
Marge Simpson,"Lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, I'll be here in half a jiff."
Bart Simpson,I want to quit and come home.
Bart Simpson,I want to quit and come home.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, honey... I heard you the first time."
Commandant,Atten-hut!
Commandant,"Gentlemen, we now have a girl cadet among our ranks, so we're going to have to make a few changes. First of all, Franklin, you are no longer the girliest cadet here."
Cadet Franklin,"Well, we'll see about that!"
Commandant,"Second, this is now the girls' barracks. So pack your things. You're moving in with Company ""L""."
Cadet Larsen,"Company ""L""? But they smell!"
Commandant,"Yes, we've all heard the chant. Now fall out!"
Lisa Simpson,Sorry. Sorry. I know we'll be friends. Talk about getting off on the wrong foot... heh heh.
,
Cadet Platt,I can't believe they let a girl in.
Cadets,"Yo, Bart! Over here! Etc."
Cadet Larsen,Don't worry. We'll drive her out of the academy. That is why God created hazing.
Cadet Larsen,What's the matter? Don't girls like doing push-ups in the mud?!
Lisa Simpson,Is there any answer I can give that won't result in more push-ups?
Cadets,
Cadet Platt,No.
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, look, it's the school motto."
Bart Simpson,"""I'll die before I surrender, Tim."" Who's Tim?"
Lisa Simpson,Apparently Tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head.
Bart Simpson,"Cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything I stand for. I don't think I can survive here, Lis."
Lisa Simpson,"That's how they want you to feel. But if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you."
Cadet Larsen,Get to work! I want to see my face in that horse's ass.
,
Cadet Larsen,"Okay, that's long enough. Let's see how they're doing."
Cadet Larsen,Had enough?
Lisa Simpson,
Cadet Platt,"What say you, men? Has this lowly maggot passed the test?"
Cadets,"Congratulations Bart! / You made it! / You're one of us, Bart!"
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, what about me? I'm a lowly maggot!"
,
Instructor,"Since you attended public school, I'm going to assume that you're already proficient with small arms. So, we'll start you off with something a little more advanced."
Instructor,"Four out of five, Simpson. Impressive, but you missed your last target."
Bart Simpson,Did I?
,
Nelson Muntz,Haw! Haw!
,
Cadet Larsen,"You're a born soldier, Simpson. Too bad it doesn't run in your family."
,
Cadet Larsen,"Platt, do you hear anything?"
Cadet Platt,No!
Lisa Simpson,
Instructor,Maybe you should just learn to use this.
Instructor,"If there's a war, just blow on it and I'll come help you."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I am just calling home, I am not asking to come home."
,
Homer Simpson,Marge? You got that? Marge?!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, go on, boy. Go get it! Answer the phone! Be a good boy!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing."
Homer Simpson,
,
Orderly,Simpson.
Grampa Simpson,Hot diggity! I don't care if it's bad news!
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Grampa, you're not busy are you?"
Grampa Simpson,"Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first one takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, only hours ahead of the Three Stooges...And I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnips. The following morning, I resigned my commission in the coast guard. The next thing I heard, there was civil war in Spain."
Grampa Simpson,And that's everything that happened in my life right up to the time I got this phone call.
Lisa Simpson,"Uh-huh. So, anything else you want to talk about?"
Grampa Simpson,"I'm afraid I'd just be repeating myself, honey. Anyway, other people need to use the phone."
Jasper Beardly,Mmm-mmm. I've already talked to her for twenty damn minutes.
,
Bart Simpson,What is it?
Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad! I thought we could listen to it together."
Bart Simpson,"Gee, Lis, I'd love to, but this really isn't a good time..."
Cadet Larsen,"Bart, who you talking to?"
Bart Simpson,Uh...
Lisa Simpson,Lisa. You're talking to Lisa.
Bart Simpson,I'm talking to... no one.
Commandant,"All right, lights out!"
Commandant,Ow! Dammit! Lights on! Lights on!
Commandant,Lights out! Lights out!
Cadets,Drop! Drop! Drop! Drop!
Marge Simpson,"...and don't worry, sweetie, it's very common to be homesick when you're so far away from the people who love you."
Lisa Simpson,Okay. I'm not gonna give up. Solitude never hurt anyone. Emily Dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! And went crazy as a loon.
Marge Simpson,"""YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE, MY ONLY SUNSHINE / YOU MAKE ME HAPPY, WHEN SKIES ARE GRAY / YOU'LL NEVER KNOW, DEAR / HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU / SO DON'T TAKE MY SUNSHINE AWAY..."""
Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry I froze you out, Lis. I--I just didn't want the guys to think I'd gone soft on the girl issue."
Lisa Simpson,"Ech, I'm tired of being an issue, Bart. Maybe everyone would be better off if I just quit."
Bart Simpson,"But if you quit, it'll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot!"
Lisa Simpson,Why'd you say that?
Bart Simpson,"I dunno. I was just looking at my shoelaces. Look, the point is, you're going to make it, Lis. And I'm going to stick by you."
Lisa Simpson,Don't do that. Why should we both be outcasts?
Bart Simpson,Then I'll just stick by you in secret. Like a sockmaker secretly working on a top secret sock that...
Lisa Simpson,Will you stop looking at your feet?!
Commandant,"Well, cadets, it's been a great year. You've all worked very hard developing academic skills, and general killing skills."
Bart Simpson,My killing teacher says I'm a natural.
Commandant,"But these skills are nothing without courage and stamina. Traditionally, the academy tested these virtues by pitting you against each other in a two-day Battle Royale."
Lisa Simpson,
Commandant,"That was prior to 1957, thank you very much, State Supreme Court. Consequently, now, no cadet can receive a passing grade for the academic year without first conquering this..."
Commandant,"Meet ""The Eliminator."" That's a 150 foot hand-over-hand crawl across a 60 gauge hemp-jute line with a blister factor of twelve. The rope is suspended a full forty feet over a solid British acre of old-growth Connecticut Valley thorn bushes. Gentlemen, welcome to flavor country."
Lisa Simpson,This wasn't in the brochure.
Lisa Simpson,"Meet me at The Eliminator"" after lights out. P.S. The cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you."
Bart Simpson,"That's it, Lis. Now start crawling."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, it's too hard. My hand is slipping."
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"I can't do this, Bart. I'm not strong enough."
Bart Simpson,I thought you came here looking for a challenge.
Lisa Simpson,Duh! A challenge I could do.
Cadet Larsen,It was worth sneaking into town. That was some good corn.
Bart Simpson,Uh-oh.
CADET ANDERSEN,"Hey, Simpson, what are you doing out here?"
Bart Simpson,Nothin'.
CADET ANDERSEN,Nothing?! Doesn't look like nothing!
Bart Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, um... what are you doing out here?"
CADET ANDERSEN,Uh... also nothing.
Bart Simpson,Well. Okay.
CADET ANDERSEN,Okay!
Bart Simpson,Then carry on.
CADET ANDERSEN,"All right, we will!"
Bart Simpson,That was close.
Lisa Simpson,Bees. Bees.
Bart Simpson,Bees! Yaargh!
Commandant,"Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that the State Supreme Court has determined that forcing cadets to cross ""The Eliminator"" is a barbaric and malicious practice."
Lisa Simpson,Yes!
Commandant,"Hence, you will be the last class to be subjected to it. Anderson, you're up!"
Cadet Anderson,
Bart Simpson,
Commandant,"Good job, Simpson. Although that's more cursing than I like to hear from a cadet in peacetime."
Commandant,"Last up, Simpson, Lisa."
Cadet Larsen,
Cadets,"You're going down, Simpson! / Pack your make-up bag! / Hey, Simpson -- Drop in anytime! / What color is your parachute?"
Lisa Simpson,"Well, at least they're talking to me..."
Lisa Simpson,
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, if only I were in Springfield, all my friends would be cheering me on. Oh, God, I'm delirious!"
,
Lisa Simpson,Yes! You thought I couldn't but I could I did! and I could do it again let's do it again!
Bart Simpson,"Lisa, it's over, you made it. You can put your arms down."
Lisa Simpson,"I can't, they're stuck."
Cadet Platt,We're gonna make your life a living hell for the rest of the semester.
Cadet Larsen,But graduation's in three hours.
Cadet Anderson,We better go change.
Commandant,"The wars of the future will not be fought on a battlefield or at sea. They will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall mountain. In either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots. And as you go forth today, remember always, your duty is clear: to build and maintain those robots. Thank you."
Homer Simpson,"Well, Bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?"
Bart Simpson,"Sir, yes sir! Luckily, I am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat, sir!"
Marge Simpson,"Well, he's got more confidence!"
Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy could use more confidence."
Commandant,"Lisa, before you go, I want to present you with this."
Lisa Simpson,"A medal? Thank you, Sir!"
Lisa Simpson,For satisfactory completion of the second grade.
Homer Simpson,"Well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to Disneyland for real!"
Lisa Simpson,Yay!
,
Lisa Simpson,HEY!!
Marge Simpson,
,
Moe Szyslak,"Wha-- Uh-oh. Here comes the evening rush. Clear out, fellas."
Barflies,What a day. / Let's get started. / Some serious drinkin'. /
Homer Simpson,"'Evening, Moe."
Barney Gumble,"'Morning, Moe."
Chauffeur,"Here we are, Mr. Gumbel."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys. The Springfield Police have told me that 91 per cent of all traffic accidents are caused by you six guys."
Barflies,
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, I know. But the bad news is we gotta start having designated drivers."
Barflies,
Moe Szyslak,We'll choose the same way they pick the Pope.
Moe Szyslak,Everybody reach in and draw a pickled egg. Whoever gets the black egg stays sober tonight.
Barney Gumble,NOOOOOOOOOO!
Homer Simpson,You got the black one.
Homer Simpson,"Hey everybody, I'm Peter Pantsless!"
Barney Gumble,I can't take this much longer. I gotta have a beer.
Barney Gumble,"Oh, no. Oh, no. Not tonight. Not tonight!"
Duffman,Are you ready to get Duffed?
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, it's Duffman! The guy in a costume that creates awareness of Duff!"
Duffman,"Duffman wants to party down with the man who sent in ten thousand Duff labels to bring me here today. I've got a bottomless mug of new ""Duff Extra Cold"" for... BARNEY GUMBEL!"
Cheerleaders,Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Barney Gumble,I can't! I'm the designated driver!
Duffman,"Ehhh... That's swell. Duff wholeheartedly supports the designated driver program... Now, who wants to party?!"
Crowd,
,
Carl Carlson,
Barney Gumble,"Please, I'm trying to drive."
Lenny Leonard,"Hey, let's go to the girls' college!"
Carl Carlson,"No, the Playboy Mansion! Playboy Mansion!"
Homer Simpson,"Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold!"
Barney Gumble,"Oh, that's just drunk talk. Sweet, beautiful drunk talk..."
,
Homer Simpson,"Goodnight, Barney. Don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. Just slide it under the door."
Barney Gumble,Yes. Tomorrow.
,
Moe Szyslak,"Face it, Homer, the car is gone. Barney ain't never comin' back."
Barney Gumble,All I remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at Villanova. Or maybe it was a streetcorner.
Homer Simpson,"So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school."
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself."
Homer Simpson,"Marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts."
Marge Simpson,"Sorry, sorry."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you got a letter from the City of New York!"
Homer Simpson,Throw it away! Nothing good has ever come out of New York City!
Lisa Simpson,"""Dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of Manhattan..."""
Homer Simpson,My vehicle!
Lisa Simpson,"""...If you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the East River at your expense."""
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't want to go to New York City."
Marge Simpson,Why not?
Homer Simpson,"New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes."
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to."
Bart Simpson,Yeah! That's what people do in Russia!
Homer Simpson,It's time I told you about a chapter of my life I hoped would be closed forever. I was on my way to the Harrisburg Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat. But it required a stopover in New York City.
,
Homer Simpson,All I had to do was walk a few blocks from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to my train at Penn Station...
Homer Simpson,"Anyhow, I must have looked at somebody the wrong way...because the next thing I knew, I was running for my life."
Homer Simpson,And that's when the CHUDs came at me.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer. Of course you'll have a bad impression of New York if you only focus on the pimps and the CHUDs."
Lisa Simpson,"Aw, I'd love to see New York. We could all go with the bus company's special Supersitter Fare!"
Bart Simpson,Nine bucks?! This one's on me.
Marge Simpson,Great! We're all going to New York!
Homer Simpson,"Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this!"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, our baby pictures were in there!"
Homer Simpson,Don't you start.
,
Marge Simpson,"Wake up, everyone. We're almost there."
,
Bart Simpson,That took too long! How come we had to transfer in Atlanta twice?
Lisa Simpson,I just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't feel my legs!"
Homer Simpson,I can't feel my legs!
Marge Simpson,"Homer! Homer, those legs belong to the man behind you."
,
Lisa Simpson,We're here!
Marge Simpson,Wow! I feel like such a nobody.
,

Edna Krabappel,"Oh, Superintendent Chalmers. Can I offer you a cup of coffee-flavored Beverine?"
Seymour Skinner,Yes Mother.
Gary Chalmers,"Yeah, I take it grey, with creamium. But first, before Skinner shows up, I have a secret announcement. In honor of Seymour's twentieth year as principal, we've decided to hold a surprise tribute Friday night."
Groundskeeper Willie,"It's my twentieth year, too."
Gary Chalmers,"Ech. The teachers' lounge is for teachers, Willie."
,
Miss Hoover,"And for the tribute, I need a volunteer to present an oral report on Principal Skinner's life."
Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover? Which one is oral?
Miss Hoover,"Out of your mouth, Ralph. Volunteers?"
Miss Hoover,"Thank you, Lisa."
Ralph Wiggum,"Um, no, Miss Hoover, I'm Ralph!"
Miss Hoover,"I only need one volunteer, Ralph."
Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover? Which one is one?
Lisa Simpson,Ralph and I could do the report together.
Miss Hoover,It's your funeral.
Ralph Wiggum,Miss Hoover?
,
Marge Simpson,Bart? Why are you doing that?
Bart Simpson,Our class is making refreshments for Skinner's party. These are in honor of his Army days.
Marge Simpson,"Uh huh, that explains the flags. What about the dog food?"
Bart Simpson,"My theory is, Skinner likes dog food."
Marge Simpson,Let's bake him a cake.
Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a fresh batch of America Balls! Mmm..."
,
Agnes Skinner,"Seymour, tell me what time it is. Now!"
Seymour Skinner,"Seven o'clock Friday night, Mother. Time for our weekly silhouette."
Agnes Skinner,No! Cutting out your ugly nose gives me a hand cramp!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, but you love silhouette night! And then we go through your bird book and make up silly captions and -- Mother, why are you all dressed up?"
Agnes Skinner,I'm sick of this house and I'm sick of you. Tonight we're going for a drive!
Seymour Skinner,"Mmm, what's so special about tonight?"
Agnes Skinner,Nothing! Now put on your special suit and get in the car.
,
Seymour Skinner,"Why are we stopping at my school, Mother? What does it say on that sign?"
Agnes Skinner,I don't like your tone.
Crowd,"Surprise! / Happy 20th anniversary, Principal! / etc."
Agnes Skinner,"Happy anniversary, Son."
Seymour Skinner,"Oh Mother, you are still the master of deception."
Agnes Skinner,I surely am.
Lisa Simpson,"...So in 1966, a brave young man named Seymour Skinner enlisted and shipped out to Vietnam, where he rose to become Platoon Sergeant. Ralph?"
Ralph Wiggum,Principal Skinner is an old man who lives at the school. Lisa?
Lisa Simpson,Sgt. Skinner was a hero. He risked capture many times behind enemy lines.
Ralph Wiggum,Teacher made me go to Principal Skinner's office when I was dirty.
Lisa Simpson,"And he survived to make it back to Springfield, where he became the fine educator we salute tonight."
Ralph Wiggum,"When I grow up, I want to be a principal or a caterpillar. I love you, Principal Skinner."
Student Choir,"THEY CALL HIM ""SKINNER"" / ""SKINNER"" / FASTER THAN LIGHTNING / NO ONE YOU SEE / IS STRICTER THAN HE..."
Stranger,"""Tribute to Seymour Skinner!"" Pull over, driver."
Gary Chalmers,"Now, I know the school normally serves cake only on Thursdays. And I'm also well aware that today is Friday. Nevertheless, I have a surprise for you."
Bart Simpson,I hope you all brought forks and plates!
Seymour Skinner,Oh! What the -- an enjoyment buzzer?!
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night to share with the people and the town that I love. I have never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner."
Stranger,You're not Seymour Skinner!
Seymour Skinner,Skinner!
Gary Chalmers,Skinner?
Stranger,I'm Skinner!
Agnes Skinner,Seymour!
Seymour Skinner,Mother!
Stranger,She's my mother!
Crowd,
Gary Chalmers,"Will someone remove that crazy man, please?"
Seymour Skinner,"No...No he's, he's not crazy. It's true: I'm, I'm an impostor. That man is the real Seymour Skinner."
Crowd,
Gary Chalmers,Now let's clear this up. Who exactly are you?
Stranger,"Sergeant Seymour Skinner, U.S. Army."
Seymour Skinner,It's true. I was in his platoon... But they said you were killed on that scouting mission!
Sgt. Skinner,"No, just captured. It's kind of a funny story really. After five years in a secret POW camp, I was sold to China for slave labor, and since '77 I've been making sneakers at gunpoint in a sweatshop in Wuhan."
Marge Simpson,That's not a funny story.
Sgt. Skinner,"Well I guess you had to be there. Anyhow, the U.N. shut the factory down last week, and the Embassy shipped me home, and here I am."
Gary Chalmers,"So what's your story, Seymour? If that is your real name."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, obviously it isn't. My real name is Armin Tamzarian."
Bart Simpson,
Armin,"I'm an orphan from Capitol City, and those who recall my fight to outlaw teenage rudeness may be shocked to learn that I myself was once a ""street punk."""
Armin,"Oh yeah, the way I was headed, it was just a matter of time before I wound up in front of a judge."
Armin,"They gave me a choice: jail, the Army, or apologizing to the judge and the old lady. No, 'course if I'd known there was a war going on, I probably would've apologized."
Young Armin,"Okay, who wants a piece 'a me?"
Sgt. Skinner,"You trying to get yourself killed, Tamzarian? You've got your whole life ahead of ya! Don't you have any dreams?"
Young Armin,My dreams all involve combing my hair.
Sgt. Skinner,"Oh gosh, son, everybody's got dreams.... I come from a town called Springfield, and my dream is to go back and become principal of the elementary school."
Young Armin,Some people might call that a pretty corny dream. Sergeant.
Bart Simpson,Principal Skinner?
Sgt. Skinner,"Well there's nothing ""corny"" about fresh-faced youngsters skippin' to school, scrapin' knees and spellin' bees and pies cooling softly on a windowsill. Well sir, if that's corny, then corn me up."
Armin,Sgt. Skinner took me under his wing and showed me that life was worth living.
Armin,I came to think of him as the big brother I never had. He made me believe I might have a future after all.
Armin,"And when they told us he was missing, presumed dead, my future died, once again. My life lost all meaning."
Bart Simpson,Come on! Get to the part where you steal his identity!
Armin,"Ech, I'm trying to explain how emotionally fragile I was."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, it's one of those stories."
Armin,"Hmm, Sgt. Skinner meant the world to me, and I... I felt it was my duty to deliver the grim news to his mother."
Young Armin,"Hello, I'm uh... I'm --"
Agnes Skinner,Seymour?! Is that you?
Armin,"I don't know why I did what I did. I guess I couldn't bear to tell her about her son. What I did was wrong, but I'd do it again."
Young Armin,"Yes, Mother, it's me."
Agnes Skinner,You look different somehow... but you must be Seymour. Yes. You are Seymour.
Armin,"As strange as it sounds, deep down I think she knew I wasn't her son. But the lie made us both happier than the truth ever could have."
Agnes Skinner,You can have some lima beans as soon as you've cleaned your room. Go!
Agnes Skinner,"Upstairs, third door on the left. Don't walk on the rugs!"
Young Armin,Yes... Mother.
Armin,"Don't judge her too harshly, Sergeant. She was a lonely old woman. If you must blame someone, blame me."
Sgt. Skinner,"Uh, that's pretty much what I was planning to do there, Armin."
Armin,"Well, that's about it. And so for the past 26 years, I've dedicated myself to living out your dream."
Sgt. Skinner,I didn't dream anything about an aqua suit or a lavender shirt. But you did take care of Mom...
Agnes Skinner,A dagger! A dagger through my heart!
Armin,"Oh, here, Mother, let me help you --"
Agnes Skinner,Get your hands off me!
Sgt. Skinner,"Please, Mom --"
Agnes Skinner,"You too, stranger!"
Sgt. Skinner,I'm your son!
Agnes Skinner,I have no son!
Homer Simpson,"Look, lady, you obviously have at least one son."
Agnes Skinner,"No, I have one stranger and one fraud!"
Sgt. Skinner,"Take it easy, Mom--"
Agnes Skinner,I said back off!
Armin,"You better do as she says -- she's quick with a hat pin. Ah, well, I suppose I'll have to find a hotel."
Gary Chalmers,I won't hear of it. Tonight you can sleep on the floor of your office.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Armin."
Armin,
Bart Simpson,Mrs. Krabappel sent me. I forged my dad's signature on my report card.
Armin,"Oh, now, Bart, you know that's wrong."
Bart Simpson,"Well, I don't see how me signing Homer's name is any different from you using Sgt. Skinner's name."
Armin,I guess my punishing you would be somewhat hypocritical. Why don't you just write a thirty word essay on what you've done.
Bart Simpson,"Hey, hey, hey! Easy there, you big impostor."
,
Armin,"So, uh, um, should I sign my original name?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Just put an X, then call yourself whatever the hell you want."
Armin,"Well now, there's no need for profanity. My name may have changed, but I'm still the same man I was last week."
Marge Simpson,"Not to us you're not. I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly found out Ned Flanders was an impostor?"
Armin,Who's Ned Flanders?
Marge Simpson,My next-door neighbor? Religious guy?
Armin,"Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy."
Marge Simpson,"No I don't! What I mean is, to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not."
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel."
Armin,"No, don't apologize. It's time I stopped pretending."
,
Armin,"I've called this assembly to announce my retirement, effective as of the end of this sentence."
Armin,This sentence I'm speaking. Right now. Period.
Audience,
Armin,"I wrongfully usurped Sgt. Skinner's position, and I suggest you consider him to replace me. Thank you."
Gary Chalmers,"Well, now I don't know... Skinner, do you know anything about being a principal?"
Sgt. Skinner,"Well, it's been my lifelong ambition. And if a man pretending to be me could do it, well then logically the real me must be far more qualified."
,
,
,
Sgt. Skinner,"Why you've led quite a life, Tamzarian."
Armin,It's your life. I just kept it warm for you.
Armin,"Oh, I nearly forgot -- your pocket watch. Mother's picture is still inside. Take good care of her."
Sgt. Skinner,I'll wind her every day.
Agnes Skinner,"I poached some fish for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian. They're full of tiny bones, so I want you to be careful."
Armin,"I will, Moth -- Uh, Mrs. Skinner. Well, I better be going."
,
Armin,"Good evening, Edna. I know we were planning to see a film tonight, but instead I'm leaving town forever."
Edna Krabappel,"No, please! I don't care what you've done. You're still a decent, honorable man."
Armin,"Mmm, that's the kind of talk that makes me want to marry you."
Edna Krabappel,Oh!
Armin,"But instead, I'm leaving town forever. Good-bye."
Edna Krabappel,
,
Armin,"Well, it's time to pick up where I left off. As a no-good street punk."
,
Armin,"Up yours, children!"
Kent Brockman,Now to recap our top story in its entirety: The adaptable citizens of Springfield have opened their hearts to Principal Seymour Skinner. Who...
Kent Brockman,Not that one. Idiots.
Sgt. Skinner,"Thank you. Thank you. I must say, in many ways, Springfield really beats the old slave-labor camp."
Crowd,
,
Lisa Simpson,I admit Sgt. Skinner seems okay... but Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
Bart Simpson,He lied about his name.
Lisa Simpson,"His name doesn't matter. ""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet."""
Bart Simpson,"Not if you called 'em ""stench blossoms""."
Homer Simpson,"Or ""crapweeds""."
Marge Simpson,I'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for Valentine's Day. I'd rather have candy.
Homer Simpson,"Not if they were called ""scumdrops""."
,
Gary Chalmers,"Your new principal would like to say a few words. Remember, you have to respect him -- he's a war hero."
Nelson Muntz,Haw-haw!
Sgt. Skinner,"Thank you, Chalmers. You know, where I come from, there's no better way to get acquainted than by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance together. Why don't you lead us, son?"
Bart Simpson,"Hey America, you're so fine. You're so fine, you blow my mind. America."
Class,
Sgt. Skinner,"Well, that's very concise, but it's an insult to everything I suffered for. Now take a seat, junior, and listen to someone who gave their youth in service of their country. Mrs. Krabappel? The pledge, please."
Edna Krabappel,"You haven't dealt with women for a long time, have you, Sergeant?"
Sgt. Skinner,Are you asking me out?
,
Armin,"Ah, 433rd Street, my old neighborhood..."
,
Homer Simpson,Fair enough.
Grampa Simpson,"Hel-lo, beautiful!"
Agnes Skinner,In your dreams.
Armin,"""Oh yes, oh yes, Capitol City's nakedest ladies. They're not even wearing a smile. Nod suggestively. Yes, six, count 'em, six gorgeous ladies just dying for your leers and catcalls. Yowza, yowza."""
,
Agnes Skinner,"Seymour, it's 7:30! Where were you?"
Sgt. Skinner,"A bar, Mom."
Agnes Skinner,"I don't know what that is, but on Fridays you come straight home after school. Tonight is silhouette night. Sit there."
Sgt. Skinner,I really just came home to change into a turtleneck.
Agnes Skinner,Seymour! Sit!
Sgt. Skinner,"In the morning. Oh, Mom -- I'm borrowing your car."
,
Marge Simpson,"Good morning, Agnes. How's your new son working out?"
Agnes Skinner,"That child is the most disobedient, smart-alecky middle-aged man in creation."
Edna Krabappel,"Hello, ladies. Is this the line for people who want to bad-mouth Sgt. Skinner?"
Marge Simpson,And have ten items or less.
Edna Krabappel,Twelve... eleven... ten. The man's a weenie.
Marge Simpson,"Oh, now be fair, Edna. I liked Armin Tamzarian too, but he was at least as big a weenie as Sgt. Skinner."
Edna Krabappel,But he was our weenie!
Agnes Skinner,Now there was a weenie you could be proud to call your son.
Marge Simpson,Did you ever tell him that?
,
Homer Simpson,"Okay, once more. Where are we going?"
Edna Krabappel,To Capitol City.
Homer Simpson,And why are you and the old lady in the car?
Agnes Skinner,We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian into coming back.
Homer Simpson,And why is Marge here?
Marge Simpson,I came up with the idea.
Homer Simpson,And why am I here?
Marge Simpson,Because the streets of Capitol City are no place for three unescorted ladies.
Homer Simpson,And why are the kids here?
Marge Simpson,Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.
Homer Simpson,And why is Grampa here?
Grampa Simpson,'Cause Jasper didn't wanna come by himself.
Grampa Simpson,We'll see about that!
Grampa Simpson,"Hello, beautiful."
,
,
Armin,"My mind is made up. I'm not coming back, and that's final."
Edna Krabappel,"Oh, Seymour --"
Armin,"And I'm not Seymour! My name is Armin! This is Armin's apartment! Armin's liquor! Armin's copy of ""Swank""! Armin's frozen peas!"
Homer Simpson,"Can I see your copy of ""Swank"", Armin?"
Armin,"Yes you can. This is Armin's life, and maybe it's not perfect, but at least I'm back where I belong. I was born a nogoodnik and I'll die a nogoodnik."
Agnes Skinner,Seymour!
Agnes Skinner,I didn't bring you up to use language like that!
Armin,"Well, you didn't bring me up at all."
Agnes Skinner,The hell I didn't! I've been taking care of you for 26 years. I'm the only mother you've ever known!
Armin,But you have your real son--
Agnes Skinner,"You're my real son! You've been my son longer than he has, and he doesn't need me, and I don't need him! Now you march yourself downstairs and get in that car!"
Armin,"Yes, Mother."
Agnes Skinner,And the rest of you too!
All,"Yes, Mrs. Skinner."
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody, look! Armin Tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!"
Crowd,
Mayor Joe Quimby,Now hold on. Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character who played us all for chumps.
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right. So, he's a fraud. I don't care! His mom doesn't care! Do any of you care?"
Crowd,No / Not really / Not very much / etc.
Sgt. Skinner,You all seem to be forgetting that I am Seymour Skinner. This is where I belong. You can't ask me to disappear just because you like some other guy better! I gave half my life for you people. Aren't I entitled to a little dignity?
Armin,"You're ah... you're right, Sergeant."
,
Gary Chalmers,"Well, I don't see any way out of this."
Homer Simpson,"Now, if you'll allow me, I think I have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let Sgt. Skinner keep his dignity."
,
Sgt. Skinner,But I'm a hero!
Homer Simpson,And we salute you for it. Now don't come back.
Agnes Skinner,"I'm sorry, Seymour. It's nice you're alive, but you're just not what I'm looking for in a son. I'm glad you understand."
Armin,"Well this is a lovely gesture, but we still have to face the fact that I'm not really Seymour Skinner."
Homer Simpson,Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?
Judge Snyder,"By authority of the City of Springfield, I hereby confer upon you the name of Seymour Skinner, as well as his past, present, future, and mother."
Armin,Okay.
Judge Snyder,"And I further decree that everything will be just like it was before all this happened, and no one will ever mention it again... under penalty of torture!"
Crowd,
Agnes Skinner,"Here, son. This is yours again...."
Seymour Skinner,"I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner. But these last few days as that hot-headed rogue Armin Tamzarian have taught me a thing or two. You know, maybe I've been a little too ""uptight"" in the past. Well, from now on you're gonna to see a new Seymour Skinner--"
Agnes Skinner,Oh no we won't.
Seymour Skinner,"Yes, Mother."

Bart Simpson,"Oh yeah? My dear Lisa, you are eight and I am ten. And in my two extra years on this planet, I've learned a few tricks. Gimme that sax!"
Lisa Simpson,No!
Bart Simpson,I said gimme!
Lisa Simpson,I said no!
Lisa Simpson,
,
Nelson Muntz,Haw haw!
,
Homer Simpson,"Aw, Lisa, it doesn't look so bad."
Lisa Simpson,Oh yeah?
Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better I'll destroy something Bart loves."
Bart Simpson,Hey!
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. If that bothers you, I'll destroy something Maggie loves."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you don't understand. This saxophone is like my oldest friend. I've had it for as long as I can remember."
Homer Simpson,You don't remember how you got it?
Lisa Simpson,Nuh-uh.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school..."
Lisa Simpson,"Look, Mama!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, honey, I can't right now. Bart's gonna be late!"
Homer Simpson,"Now, son, on your first day of school, I'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me..."
Grampa Simpson,"Homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. If a strange man offers you a ride, I say take it!"
Homer Simpson,Lousy traumatic childhood.
Marge Simpson,"Ooh, there's the bus. Goodbye, sweetheart!"
Bart Simpson,School will be fun!

Groundskeeper Willie,Hey! Wee Bairn! Hie ye hence from me heath! Can't ya understand English!
Marge Simpson,Hi honey! How was your first day of school? Honey?
Homer Simpson,BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE...
Marge Simpson,IT'S A SHAME WHAT SCHOOL CAN DO.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,FOR NO REASON HERE'S APU --
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,THOSE WERE THE DAYYYYYS.
Homer Simpson,"And that, my children, is the story of Bart's first day of school."
Bart Simpson,Very nice.
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Lisa Simpson,Yeah. Except you were supposed to be telling the story of how I got my saxophone!
Homer Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I can't get the baby to burp. Could you try for a while?"
Homer Simpson,No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time!
Marge Simpson,Homer!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, my father gave me beer as a child. Till I wrapped my little red wagon around a tree."
,
Young Barney,Let's never drink again.
Homer Simpson,And we never did.
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, can you tell me the story of how I got my saxophone and not have it turn into a story about Bart!"
Marge Simpson,"Sure, honey. Bart had just completed his first day at school. And Bart just..."
Lisa Simpson,Mom!
Bart Simpson,"Hey, she's just giving the public what it wants. Bart by the barrel ful."
Marge Simpson,"Sorry, Lisa. It's just how the story goes. No matter what Bart tried, he just couldn't fit in at school."
,
Bart Simpson,"A, B, C... Uh... line?"
Kindergarten Teacher,D.
Bart Simpson,"D, E... Um... line?"
Kindergarten Teacher,"F, Bart. And believe me, you'll be seeing plenty of 'em."

Marge Simpson,"Bart, would you like to read a book?"
Bart Simpson,No.
Marge Simpson,Would you like to color something?
Bart Simpson,I did.
Marge Simpson,

Man On Tv,That's damn fine coffee you got here in Twin Peaks. And damn good cherry pie.
Homer Simpson,Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I want you to look at this drawing Bart did."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!"
Marge Simpson,Homer stop! Would you please look at the drawing?
Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right. What a- Burn it! Send it to Hell!"
Marge Simpson,I think we're going to have to get Bart some help.
Homer Simpson,Get it away!
,
Homer Simpson,"Bart, son. You wanna play catch?"
Bart Simpson,No.

Homer Simpson,"When a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong."
Grampa Simpson,"I'll play catch with you, son."
Homer Simpson,Get the hell out.
Grampa Simpson,I'm gone.

Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Mrs. Simpson, physically your son is as sound as a dollar. I'm afraid Bart's severe emotional dysfunction stems from a deep-seated psychological trauma."
,
Marge Simpson,"With nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist..."
,
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, there's nothing to be alarmed about. Public school can be intimidating to a young child, particularly one with as many flamboyantly homosexual tendencies as your son."
Marge Simpson,Bart's gay?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"Bart? Uh, whoo, wrong file."
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"Uh, look, th-the point I'm trying to make here is that Bart must learn to be less of an individual and more a faceless slug..."
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"Hmm. Lisa, how old are you?"
Lisa Simpson,I am three and three eighths!
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"Hm. Lisa, if I have five apples and I take away three apples, how many apples do I have left?"
Lisa Simpson,Two apples!
Homer Simpson,Wait a minute... she's right!
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"Heh, very good."
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"Marge, Homer, I believe your Lisa may be gifted."
Marge Simpson,"That's wonderful! But still, can't you do anything for Bart?"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, he's five. His life is over. Lisa's the wave of the future."
Lisa Simpson,Wave of da future!
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,"That's right, honey. If you nurture her gift now, there's no telling what she can do."
Homer Simpson,Wow. Just think of the possibilities.
Announcer,Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize.
Homer Simpson,Nah.
Announcer,Lisa Simpson has won the Nobel Prize for Kickboxing.
Homer Simpson,Hm.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror,Uh... I'll give you the address of a nice pre-school.

Homer Simpson,"Well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her."
Headmistress,"Very good. Once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition check, she's in."
Homer Simpson,I'll give ya fifty bucks.
Headmistress,Our fee is non-negotiable.
Homer Simpson,Seventy-five.
Marge Simpson,"Look, I knew private school would be expensive but I was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort."
Headmistress,Sorry. I don't have anything to offer you unless you're a member of a minority group.

Homer Simpson,"Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisa's gifts were going to waste."
Bart Simpson,"Uh, Homer? It's five years later and I'm still miserable at school."
Lisa Simpson,And my gifts are still going to waste.
Marge Simpson,And sometimes I feel so smothered by this family I just want to scream till my lungs explode! Uh... I'll go start dinner now.
Homer Simpson,You do that.
Marge Simpson,
Grampa Simpson,Hello!
Homer Simpson,"Dad, what are you doin' here?"
Grampa Simpson,Looking for my teeth.
Santa's Little Helper,
Grampa Simpson,Gimme those!
Grampa Simpson,"Better wash these off. Ah, the hell with it."
Marge Simpson,"Well, Grampa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that took place when Bart was five and Lisa was three."
,
Marge Simpson,"Yeeesss. Well, as if our troubles weren't bad enough, Springfield was going through an unseasonable heat wave..."
Kent Brockman,"And so, Springfield's heat wave continues with today's temperature exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of molten lava."
Homer Simpson,Ohhh. So hottt.
Marge Simpson,"Homer, have you seen the frozen peas?"
Marge Simpson,"Uhh... you keep 'em. Now listen. If we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage Lisa. Umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the Museum on Saturday..."
Homer Simpson,"Uh-uh. Forget it Marge. There is no way I am spending my Saturdays at a Museum. Unless... Museums don't have foosball, do they?"
Homer Simpson,"You lose, Michelangelo's David. Who's next?"
Man,Meeee!
Marge Simpson,I guess it doesn't matter. All these things cost money and we just don't have it. Unless...
Homer Simpson,Unless what?
Marge Simpson,"Well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
Snowball II,
Marge Simpson,I cannot believe this. I'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
Homer Simpson,"Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning."
Marge Simpson,Balzac!
Homer Simpson,No need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
Marge Simpson,But Balzac is the name--
Homer Simpson,"Up up up up up up up. If ""ifs"" and ""buts"" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?"
Marge Simpson,"Please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help Lisa."
Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, I promise. There must be another way to get an air conditioner..."
Homer Simpson,Mmmm... re-circulated air.
Ned Flanders,Uh... Homer?
Homer Simpson,"What, Flanders."
Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
Homer Simpson,"Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders, but haven't you heard of ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"""
Todd Flanders,"Got him, Dad!"
Marge Simpson,"And so, just as things looked their worst..."
Grampa Simpson,...I realized I could make money selling my medication to Deadheads!
Marge Simpson,"Grampa, what are you talking about?"

Lisa Simpson,"Well, I really liked that story. But it still doesn't fix this."
Marge Simpson,"You know, Homer... I think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?"
Homer Simpson,"Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?"

Mayor Joe Quimby,"I stand by my ethnic slur. Do your worst you filthy, pretentious savages!"

Homer Simpson,"Relax, I built a bomb shelter."
Lisa Simpson,That's not gonna protect us from anything.
Homer Simpson,"Fine, then don't use it."

,
Goody Maude,"Oh, Neddy, look at them up there plotting our doom. They could force us to commit wanton acts of carnality."
Goodman Flanders,"Yeah, that'll be the day."
Goody Maude,"What's that, Ned?"
Goodman Flanders,"Ah, we shouldn't fear the witches, Maude. We're both 35. We've already gone way past our life expectancy..."
Goody Maude,But think of the children! I've heard that witches come to your house and take your children away to eat them!
,
Selma Bouvier,"Hmm... ""Eat their children?"""
Patty Bouvier,"Geez, we were just gonna swipe their shoes."
Selma Bouvier,But a good idea is a good idea.
,
Selma Bouvier,
Goodman Flanders,Who is it?
Selma Bouvier,Witches.
Goody Maude,"Um, what do you want?"
Marge Simpson,We're here to eat your kids.
Goodman Flanders,"Okay, come on in... and look at this!"
Patty Bouvier,"Oh, puh-leeze."
Selma Bouvier,Now make with the kids.
Rod Flanders,"Don't blame yourself, Daddy."
Todd Flanders,You did everything you could.
Goodman Flanders,"Maude, do something."
Goody Maude,"Uh. Um, well, s'cuse me, are you sure you ladies wouldn't prefer some gingerbread children instead?"
Goodman Flanders,They're boneless.
Selma Bouvier,
Todd Flanders,
,
Ralph Wiggum,"Bye, witchies. Thanks for not eating me."
Constable Wiggum,"Yeah, you hags are all right."
Selma Bouvier,What did you get?
Marge Simpson,Candied apple!
Patty Bouvier,I got a caramel cod!
Selma Bouvier,"Mm, ya know, scaring people into giving us treats is fun. We should do this every year."
Marge Simpson,I just wish we hadn't filled up on all those kids before we got to the Flanders'.
Captain Horatio McCallister,"Yar... and that's the story of the very first caramel cod. I mean, Halloween. And it wasn't long before this yearly custom became an annual tradition."
Homer Simpson,"C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you're not home!"
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's our house."
Homer Simpson,She's a witch!
Townspeople,"Get her! Get her! / She's a witch! / Yeah, burn her!"
,
Gulliver Dark,OPEN WIDE FOR SOME SOCCERRRR!
Announcer,"The Continental Soccer Association is coming to Springfield! It's all here. Fast kickin', low scorin', and ties? You bet!"
Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?"
Homer Simpson,I don't know.
Announcer,You'll see all your favorite soccer stars like: Ariaga! Ariaga II! Bariaga! Aruglia! And Pizzoza!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've never heard of those people."
Announcer,And they'll all be signin' autographs.
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Announcer,This match will determine once and for all which nation is the greatest on earth: Mexico or Portugal.
Lisa Simpson,"Can we go, Dad? / Please Dad? / Please, please, please? / Can we go, huh, huh please? /"
Homer Simpson,"Yes, yes, oh God yes!"
,
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win."
Marge Simpson,It's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.
Bart Simpson,Yo Paella Man! Wing one up here!
Lisa Simpson,Hey look. It's PelÃ©!
PelÃ©,"PelÃ© is king of the soccer field. To be king of your kitchen, use Crestfield wax paper."
Homer Simpson,Bo-ring!
Krusty the Clown,"Come on you schnorers, do something!"
Kent Brockman,Halfback passes to the center. Back to the wing. Back to the center. Center holds it... holds it... holds it...
Foreign Announcer,Halfback passes to center. Back to wing. Back to center. Center holds it... holds it... holds it...
Sideshow Mel,I can't bear this any longer. I'm leaving.
Moe Szyslak,"Not before me, you ain't."
Ned Flanders,"Now, now, there's plenty of exits for everyone."
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, that's it. You're dead, pal."
Seymour Skinner,"Hey, now. That's uncalled for."
Lenny Leonard,"Shut your hole, Skinner."
Seymour Skinner,Ooo... Ow!
Barney Gumble,
Sideshow Mel,Ooo... / Ow! / Hey! Oh! /
Groundskeeper Willie,"Ach! They call this a soccer riot? C'mon, boys. Let's take 'em to school!"
Soccer Hooligans,Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!
Marge Simpson,Homer. We gotta get out of here.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, but I want to do some rioting."
Soccer Hooligan,Jobbers cobknots ya mucker!
Homer Simpson,All done.
,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please."
Kent Brockman,"What began as a traditional soccer riot has escalated into a city-wide orgy of destruction. Reacting swiftly, Mayor Quimby has declared mob rule. So for the next several years, it's every family for itself."
Ned Flanders,"Ex... ex... excuse me, sir? I think you've got my TV. Sir?"
,
Lisa Simpson,Somebody's gotta stop them!
Bart Simpson,Let's wait until they burn the school down.
Marge Simpson,"Oh my God, Homer! They're right next door!"
Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Watch the fish, Marge."
Marge Simpson,
Security Salesman,Looks like you called me ju-uust in time. This home isn't secure at all.
Homer Simpson,"What did I tell you, Marge?"
Security Salesman,"Intruders could come in down the chimney, through the mail slot, even hidden in your groceries."
Security Salesman,"Did you change the locks when you moved in? Nah, I thought not. All the previous owners of this house could still be in here somewhere."
Marge Simpson,What do you recommend?
Security Salesman,"Well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks good but doesn't provide any real protection."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, let's get that."
Security Salesman,"But if you really want to sleep easy at night, I recommend sealing off every door and window with bullet-proof Lucite."
Marge Simpson,Wouldn't we all suffocate?
Security Salesman,"Well, I should hope not!"
Homer Simpson,Let's get that! The suffocation thing!
Security Salesman,And you can have it all for just five hundred dollars.
Homer Simpson,Five hundred dollars! Forget it.
Security Salesman,But surely you can't put a price on your family's lives.
Homer Simpson,"I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, we need something to protect this family."
Homer Simpson,"I couldn't agree more, Marjorie. You deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have."
,
Gun Clerk,"Aisle six, next to the sympathy cards."
,
Gun Clerk,"Whoa, careful there, Annie Oakley."
Homer Simpson,"I don't have to be careful, I got a gun."
Gun Clerk,"Well, you'll probably want the accessory kit: holster..."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
Gun Clerk,Bandoleer...
Homer Simpson,Baby.
Gun Clerk,Silencer...
Homer Simpson,Mmm-hmm.
Gun Clerk,Loudener...
Homer Simpson,Ahh.
Gun Clerk,Speed-cocker...
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, I like the sound of that."
Gun Clerk,And this is for shooting down police helicopters.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Just gimme my gun."
Gun Clerk,"Sorry, the law requires a five day waiting period. We've got to run a background check."
Homer Simpson,Five days! But I'm mad now!
Gun Clerk,
Homer Simpson,I'd kill you if I had my gun.
Gun Clerk,"Yeah, well, you don't."
Homer Simpson,Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
,
Homer Simpson,"Well, if he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two."
,
Homer Simpson,Let's see what happens when he walks into my store. Then we'll see who's worried about five day waiting period...
Lisa Simpson,Dad! It's three A.M.! Can't you mutter in your room?
Homer Simpson,Marge kicked me out.
Lisa Simpson,All right. Go ahead.
Homer Simpson,"Pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. I tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children."
Homer Simpson,How am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?
,
Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on, open up!"
Homer Simpson,"Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me."
Gun Clerk,"Well, let's see here, uh, according to your background check, you've been in a mental institution..."
Homer Simpson,Yuh.
Gun Clerk,Frequent problems with alcohol...
Homer Simpson,Yeah.
Gun Clerk,You beat up President Bush.
Homer Simpson,Former President.
Homer Simpson,Potentially dangerous?
Gun Clerk,"Relax, that just limits you to three handguns or less."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
,
Homer Simpson,"Close your eyes Marge, I've got a surprise for you."
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Okay. Open your eyes!
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's a handgun! Isn't it great? This is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die..."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't want guns in my house! Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?"
Homer Simpson,I thought Smithers did it.
Lisa Simpson,That would have made a lot more sense.
Bart Simpson,"Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow? I want to scare that old security guard at the bank."
Homer Simpson,Only if you clean your room.
Marge Simpson,"No! No one's using this gun. The TV said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder."
Homer Simpson,TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution.
Lisa Simpson,Dad! The 2nd Amendment is just a remnant from Revolutionary days. It has no meaning today.
Homer Simpson,"You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that? Huh? Do you?"
Lisa Simpson,No...
Homer Simpson,"All right, then."
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons."
Homer Simpson,"A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what: you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more."
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"No, thanks!"
Homer Simpson,Pull!
Lenny Leonard,"Assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately, but they're manufactured for a reason: to take out today's modern super-animals, such as the flying squirrel and the electric eel."
Homer Simpson,"Learnin' somethin', Marge?"
Marge Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,"Uh, hi, I'm Moe S."
Crowd,"Hi, Moe."
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah so, last night I was closing up the bar, when some young punk comes in and tries to stick me up."
Crowd,
Sideshow Mel,"Whatever did you do, Moe?"
Moe Szyslak,"Well, it coulda been a real ugly situation, but I managed to shoot him in the spine."
Crowd,
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I guess the next place he robs better have a ramp."
Crowd,
Homer Simpson,"Hi, I'm Homer S."
Crowd,"Hi, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Hi. It seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!"
Crowd,Woo! / Yeah! / Way to go! /
Marge Simpson,"Homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, be fair Marge. For once in your life, be fair."
Marge Simpson,
,
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Squeaky-Voiced Teen,My fault.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, don't shoot. Just take the money and get out."
Homer Simpson,"What? Oh Apu, I would never..."
Homer Simpson,Or would I?
Homer Simpson,I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.
,
Homer Simpson,"All right, put your... Oh well, I'll rob it next time."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Can you help me get my ball down from the roof, Dad?"
Homer Simpson,"Sure thing, honey."
Homer Simpson,You want me to get the cat down?
Bart Simpson,"Missed one, Dad."
Homer Simpson,"See you in hell, dinner plate."
Marge Simpson,Does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?
Bart Simpson,Uhmm...
Homer Simpson,"Mmm, you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get-together?"
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table."
Homer Simpson,You said the breakfast table.
Marge Simpson,It's the same table!
Homer Simpson,"Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on."
Homer Simpson,"Oops, guess it already was on."
Homer Simpson,Uh. I'd better just put it down.
Lisa Simpson,"No offense, Mom, but that was pretty cool."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, I think you'd agree that I've put up with a lot in this marriage."
Marge Simpson,"But this is the first time since we've been married that I've actually feared for our lives. So I'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun."
Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. I'll do it. For you."
Marge Simpson,I'm a lucky woman.
Homer Simpson,And I'm a wonderful man.
Bart Simpson,I don't feel them.
Milhouse Van Houten,"You said there'd be fudge-icles, Bart. Where's the fudge-icles?"
Bart Simpson,"First, it's fudge-cicle... And I know they're up there. I just need a better foothold."
Bart Simpson,Hello.
Bart Simpson,"And the next marksman is... William Tell, Jr.!"
Milhouse Van Houten,Jinx!
Marge Simpson,Bart!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun."
Marge Simpson,You lied to me! You promised to get rid of this gun!
Homer Simpson,"I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?"
Marge Simpson,"How could you?! Of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable..."
Homer Simpson,"But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!"
Marge Simpson,"Until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. Come on, kids."
Homer Simpson,So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!
,
Milhouse Van Houten,Do I!
,
Marge Simpson,I've left Homer.
Selma Bouvier,Thank God.
Marge Simpson,So we need a place to spend the night.
Selma Bouvier,Try the Sleep-Eazy Motel. I woke up there once. Seemed nice.
Marge Simpson,Why can't we stay here?
Selma Bouvier,"Uh, we have a gentleman caller."
Repairman,"Hey, this TV's not broken, it's just unplugged! What the..."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!"
Homer Simpson,They're here! They're here!
Moe Szyslak,"Hiya, Homer. I brung ya a big bag of irregular Oreos."
Moe Szyslak,I don't see what's wrong with this one. Oh.
,
Hooker,"Lookin' for a good time, sailor?"
Bart Simpson,I certainly am.
Marge Simpson,No you're not. He's really not.
,
Moe Szyslak,"And that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns."
Homer Simpson,"Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
Homer Simpson,Anyone else want a beer?
Dr. Julius Hibbert,Homer! You use your gun as a can opener?
Homer Simpson,I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
Agnes Skinner,I've never seen such recklessness!
Louie,You might'a hurt someone!
Cletus Spuckler,Are you some kind of moron?
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but..."
Krusty the Clown,"Hey, yutz. Guns aren't toys! They're for family protection, hunting dangerous or delicious animals, and keeping the King of England out of your face."
Moe Szyslak,"Your membership card please, Homer."
Homer Simpson,
Moe Szyslak,I'll also need to remove your tattoo.
Homer Simpson,I didn't get one yet.
Moe Szyslak,Rats.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now, since you're no longer a member, please go outside until the meeting is over."
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, we got a pool!"
Lisa Simpson,"Can we go swimmin', Mom?"
Marge Simpson,"Not right now, dear."
Bart Simpson,Wow! The TV's coin-operated.
Lisa Simpson,And so is the Bible!
Bart Simpson,"I'd like to order a wake-up call, please... three AM... ah, for every room except this one... that's right. Goodnight."
Bart Simpson,Always love tryin' out new material on the road.
Bart Simpson,"No way are you gonna to beat me this time, Lis!"
Lisa Simpson,"Yes I am! Come on, Spotty!"
Bart Simpson,"Come on, Smelly!"
,
Homer Simpson,"This gun cost me everything. My wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun."
Homer Simpson,This stinks. I want my family back.
,
Bart Simpson,"Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?"
Muffled Voice,No. Go back to sleep.
Lisa Simpson,This bed is making me nauseous. Why won't it stop?!
Marge Simpson,"Honey, it'll be morning soon. Try and get some sleep."
Marge Simpson,
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Are you planning to stay the whole night?"
Marge Simpson,Yes.
Mayor Joe Quimby,All right. Vote Quimby.
Homer Simpson,"Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?"
Mayor Joe Quimby,Vote Quimby.
Homer Simpson,Sorry.
Marge Simpson,"Down here, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, there's so many things I want to yell to you!"
Marge Simpson,Come down here.
Homer Simpson,O-kay!
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho, confused, would we?"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, please come home. I need you. It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome. And there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks."
Marge Simpson,What about the gun?
Homer Simpson,"It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?"
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie."
Marge Simpson,"C'mon, kids. We're goin' home."
Lisa Simpson,Yayyy!
,
Desk Clerk,"Okey doke, here's your bill. And your Continental Breakfast."
Snake Jailbird,"All right, everybody, hands up! You - give me the cash drawer."
Mayor Joe Quimby,Do what he says. I'm too rich to die.
Homer Simpson,"Freeze, bad guy!"
Mayor Joe Quimby,Vote Quimby.
Snake Jailbird,"Okay, man, don't shoot. Chill."
Marge Simpson,Homer! You said you got rid of the gun. You lied to me! Again!
Homer Simpson,"I know I said that, but what I secretly meant was..."
Snake Jailbird,Yoink!
Homer Simpson,"The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing."
Snake Jailbird,"Yo, give me the bullets."
Homer Simpson,"Okay, don't shoot!"
Moe Szyslak,Drop it!
Marge Simpson,How did you know we were being robbed?
Lenny Leonard,The clerk here pressed the silent alarm and we picked it up on our scanner.
Lisa Simpson,Did anyone stop that robber?
Moe Szyslak,"No, I don't think so."
Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!"
Marge Simpson,
,
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, your cholesterol level is lethally high, Homer. But I'm more concerned about your gravy level."
Homer Simpson,Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, you're a little confused."
Maude Flanders,"Okay, gentlemen, I want you to raise your hand when you hear the tone."
Old Jewish Man,You can't tell me what to do!
Grampa Simpson,Nothin' yettt...
Marge Simpson,"Now make no mistake. When I say ""first aid,"" I'm not talking about some sort of charity rock concert!"
Marge Simpson,I'm talking about treating serious injuries.
Krusty the Clown,"Serious injuries. Oh, that's gold."
Lisa Simpson,"Mom, mom. I stepped in a bear trap."
Marge Simpson,Sounds like you need some first aid.
Crowd,Ohhh. / Bravo. / All right.
Rainier Wolfcastle,Come on. You can't do one sit-up?
Ãœter,"I loved your last McBain movie, Mr. Wolfcastle."
Rainier Wolfcastle,"Quit stalling, fatty."
Rainier Wolfcastle,We can wait.
Rainier Wolfcastle,Come to Papa.
Rainier Wolfcastle,C'mon! Even my fat mama can touch her toes.
Martin Prince,"Hey, Bart. We wear the same underpants."
,
Kent Brockman,"Results from yesterday's Health Fair are in and the news is not good. Springfield is in terrible shape, particularly our young boys."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Tubby. Want another Pop-Tart, Tubby?"
Bart Simpson,I'm comfortable with who I am.
Homer Simpson,You're a disgrace to this family.
Kent Brockman,In this reporter's opinion it's time for our lard-laden lads to shape up. Get out and try fun activities like military service...Frenetic dancing...
Kent Brockman,Or good old-fashioned Pee Wee Football!
Homer Simpson,"There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but I could get seriously hurt."
Homer Simpson,Then it's settled.
,
Rod Flanders,"We don't have to play football do we, Daddy?"
Ned Flanders,"Ho-ho-ho, you betcha. Team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
Todd Flanders,Yayyy!
Luann Van Houten,"You know, Milhouse, you are getting a little doughy."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Aw, can't I just have the surgery?"
,
,
Marge Simpson,"He's going to need a... you know, ""protection."""
Clerk,"Sure, one helmet comin' up."
Marge Simpson,I was thinking more like protection for... down there.
Clerk,Ohhh. Why didn't you say so? Knee pads. You got it.
Marge Simpson,"I'm talking about his ""personal area."""
Clerk,"Ahhh, ahh, say no more... I read you loud and clear. The old shoulder pads."
Marge Simpson,"Look, I want a cup."
Clerk,"Cup, could you spell that?"
Marge Simpson,C-U-P! I wanna C-U-... Oh my god!
,
Bart Simpson,"Okay, Milhouse, lets try out the new cup."
Bart Simpson,Again.
Marge Simpson,"Milhouse, stop that!"
,
Ned Flanders,"Little higher, Wendell... A lot higher, Martin... Ah, Ralph, that's a basketball."
Ned Flanders,"Oof! Okay, Nelson's our quarterback."
Nelson Muntz,"Thanks, four-eyes."
Ned Flanders,"Ralph, you'll be on special teams."
Ralph Wiggum,I'm special!
Ned Flanders,"And, uh, Bart, you'll be a tackle."
Bart Simpson,Cool!
Martin Prince,"Careful, Bart, you'll break my calculator, by which I mean my head."
Lisa Simpson,What position have you got for me?
Players,Huh? / Wha? / Etc.
Lisa Simpson,That's right. A girl wants to play football. How about that?
Ned Flanders,"Well, that's super-duper, Lisa! In fact, we already have four girls on the team."
Lisa Simpson,You do?
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh, but we'd love to have you on board."
Lisa Simpson,Well... football's not really my thing.
Team,Oh no. What? / No way! / Aww.
Lisa Simpson,"After all, what civilized person would play a game with the skin of an innocent pig?!"
Ned Flanders,"Well, actually, Lisa, these balls are synthetic."
JANEY,"And for every ball you buy, a dollar goes to Amnesty International."
Lisa Simpson,I've gotta go.
Ned Flanders,Who are we?
Team,The Wildcats!
Ned Flanders,Who are we going to beat?
Team,The Wildcats!
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders. You're the worst coach this team has ever had."
Marge Simpson,He's the only coach this team has ever had. And the season hasn't even started yet.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot."
Marge Simpson,"You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize."
Homer Simpson,"Fun, too."
Ned Flanders,"All right, Wildcats! Are you ready to give 110 per cent, take it one game at a time, and go the whole nine yards?"
Team,Yeah! Nine yards!
Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces."
Nelson Muntz,Gimme the ball... and your lunch money.
Nelson Muntz,I love this game.
Marge Simpson,"Ooo, he's quite a little dancer."
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!"
Ned Flanders,"Yeah. Thanks for the tip, Homer..."
Nelson Muntz,"Okay, Simpson, you're blocking for me on this play."
Bart Simpson,All right!
Nelson Muntz,"Hut, hut, hike, hike, HUT!"
Bart Simpson,It's clobberin' time.
Bart Simpson,
Nelson Muntz,"You okay, Bart?"
Bart Simpson,Yeah.
Team,Yayyy! / I'm special! / Wooo! / Etc.
Homer Simpson,"Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times."
,
Nelson Muntz,What a rip!!
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
Roy Firestone,"Sir, if I could just break in for a moment..."
Homer Simpson,"Yes, Roy."
Roy Firestone,Do you have a question for Sandy Koufax?
Homer Simpson,"Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think Flanders is a big jerk? Y'ello? Y'ello?"
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Homer again. I think we got cut off. Y'ello?"
,
Homer Simpson,Flaaaan-ders... Flaaaan-ders...
Ned Flanders,What?
Homer Simpson,Flaaaan-ders...
Ned Flanders,What?! What is it?!
Homer Simpson,Game's out there! Made you look...
Ned Flanders,"They're just words, Neddie. Words can't hurt ya."
Ned Flanders,Ow! That's it!
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that was really mean."
Homer Simpson,"I know, Sweetie, and I got him right in the... uh-oh."
Homer Simpson,"Hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, Flanders. Go Wildcats!"
Ned Flanders,Do you have a problem with the way I'm coaching?
Homer Simpson,"No, no. No, no, no. It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you."
Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh. Half a brain, huh? Well, you know what? It sounds like you just volunteered!"
Homer Simpson,Me? But you were doing such a great job.
,
Lisa Simpson,
Homer Simpson,You're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.
Lisa Simpson,I don't want to make the team.
Homer Simpson,Then why are you running the obstacle course?
Marge Simpson,Are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
Homer Simpson,You never use it.
Marge Simpson,
Bart Simpson,"Good morning, everybody."
Homer Simpson,Wipe that smile off your face.
Bart Simpson,What did I do?
Homer Simpson,"I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps."
Bart Simpson,"Oh, man."
Homer Simpson,Do it.
Marge Simpson,You shouldn't pressure Bart like that.
Homer Simpson,"Well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, I'd like to hear it."
Homer Simpson,"I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?"
Marge Simpson,How can you treat him that way? Don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports?
Teenage Smithers,"Well, that's the end of the girls' floor exercise. Now, let's bring on the men!"
MIDDLE-AGE GRAMPA,Just don't screw up like you always do.
Teenage Lenny,"Wow, he's dy-no-mite!"
MIDDLE-AGE GRAMPA,You're gonna blow it!
MIDDLE-AGE GRAMPA,That's what I get for having faith in ya.
Homer Simpson,My father never believed in me.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not gonna make the same mistake. From now on I'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my Dad."
,
Homer Simpson,"Quit runnin', son. I just want to give ya a big hug!"
Homer Simpson,I believe in you! Hug meeeee!
Homer Simpson,Will you hug meeeee? Hug meee!
,
Homer Simpson,"Good practice, team. Okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts."
Homer Simpson,"Now while I wasn't able to cut everyone I wanted to, I have cut a lot of you. Wendell is cut. Rudy is cut. Janey, you're gone. Steven, I like your hustle. That's why it was so hard to cut you."
Homer Simpson,"Congratulations, the rest of you made the team."
Homer Simpson,"Except you, you and you."
Martin Prince,Bart didn't get cut. What a surprise...
Homer Simpson,"Now just because I'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. He calls me ""Coach"" just like everyone else. Which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!"
Bart's Thoughts,It's gotta be a trick. Run like the wind.
Bart Simpson,"But, Coach?"
Homer Simpson,"What is it, sweetie?"
Bart Simpson,Nelson's a great quarterback. He's carryin' this team!
Team,"Yeah. / Yeah, he's right. / He's good."
Homer Simpson,"Not any more. From now on, you're my main man. Okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. Oh, Rod, you don't have to. You're cut."
,
Bart Simpson,But I can't play quarterback. I don't even know how.

Bart Simpson,"I cannot believe you are here! Do you think, maybe, you could give me some pointers?"
Joe Namath,Sure! There's only one thing you need to know to be a great quarterback...
Woman,"Joe, honey. I fixed it. It was just vapor lock."

Marge Simpson,"Well, at least I'm making conversation."
Bart Simpson,"May I be excused, Mom?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too."
Marge Simpson,"Homer, please."
Homer Simpson,"I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge. It must have been you. You've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler..."
Marge Simpson,He's doing what he thinks is best...
Homer Simpson,"Well, if quitting is the best, maybe I should just quit my job."
C. Montgomery Burns,Ahoy-hoy-hoy?

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Such a product does not exist, sir. I think you must have dreamed it."
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of Skittles."
Homer Simpson,"Hello, son."
Homer Simpson,"I wanna apologize. I just got so caught up trying to encourage you, I was blinded to your stinky performance. If you forgive me, I promise I'll never encourage you again."
Homer Simpson,I've got lots of quarters.
Bart Simpson,This thing only takes dollars.
Homer Simpson,"Aww... You know, tomorrow's the championship game and I could sure use a good offensive tackle."
Bart Simpson,But I thought Uter took my place.
Homer Simpson,Consider him cut.

Grampa Simpson,"You'd think so, wouldn't ya?"
Nelson Muntz,"Time for one last play, coach."
Homer Simpson,"Hold on, I'm workin' it out."
Homer Simpson,"Okay. Half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, Nelson, you just spin around in a circle."
Chief Wiggum,"All right, I've got an arrest warrant here for a Nelson Muntz. Uh, which one of you little punks is Muntz?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?"
Bart Simpson,"It's okay Dad, I can fill in for Nelson."
Homer Simpson,"Are you sure, son?"
Homer Simpson,I knew I could count on you.
,
Bart Simpson,"So what's the charge, Chief? Vandalism? Smoking?"
Chief Wiggum,"You know what you did, Muntz. Burglary and arson. You're goin' away for a long time."
Bart Simpson,Wuh?
Barney Gumble,
Krusty the Clown,"Come on! He likes sunsets, what more do ya want?!"
Joe Namath,"Poor Bart... You know we had a lot of fun tonight, but there's nothing funny about... vapor lock. It's the third most common cause of car stallings. So please, take care of your car and get it checked. I'm Joe Namath. Goodnight."
Homer Simpson,"Scully, you're cut. Ehhh, Brooks, Groening, Simon, you're all cut. Castellaneta, gone. Kavner, cut. Cartwright, cut. Smith, sorry, cut. Azaria and Shearer, you're cut.

Female Crowd Members,Oh-ho! Now that's somethin' else. / Real man! / My kind of a guy we're talkin'... / Wonderful.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Come on...

Miss Hoover,"I had a great time, Apu. And thanks for winning Wubbsy. I had no idea you were such a great shot."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, yes. All Kwik-E-Mart managers must be skilled in the deadly arts."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Oof. That date will not be easy to top.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,But we shall see...
Luann Van Houten,Anybody up for some clog dancing?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Why don't you try and stop me?
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"""This is just a note to say, I think about you every day. And when I get you all alone..."" Well, it gets a little bit personal, here."
Homer Simpson,I understand. Yoink. Wow...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I know.
Homer Simpson,Whoa...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Tell me about it.
Homer Simpson,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, here's one from my mother."
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, let's see what she wrote!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you hate lotus flowers, too? Oh, don't get me started on Lotus flowers."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, no. It is the sign that it is time for my arranged marriage!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, congratulations."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, no, no. Don't you know what it means?"
Homer Simpson,Not... really...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,It all happened shortly after my eighth birthday...
Homer Simpson,"O-kay, here we go..."
,
Apu's Mother,Ten goats and an electric fan? You call that a dowry?
Manjula's Mother,"Okay, we will throw in a textile factory. But only because Manjula's getting on in years."
Apu's Mother,Then it is agreed. Your third daughter will marry our first son.
Manjula's Mother,It is done.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, I cannot get married. I'm just beginning to enjoy my bachelorhood. Ah, what am I going to do?!"
Homer Simpson,Tell her the truth. You're not ready to get married.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, no, no, no, you do not know Mother. She will never quit until I am married."
Homer Simpson,Then just tell her you're already married.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"No, no. I cannot lie to my mother."
Homer Simpson,Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yes, that is right, mother. I already got married... Why did not I bother to tell you? Well, uh, the reason is..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, I guess I... I didn't-think-you'd-understand. Oh, got-to-go. Bye-bye-bye. I love-you. Love-you."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,It worked! It worked! The lie has set me free!!
Homer Simpson,Loser. Loser. Loser. Five... hundred.... dollars! Apu wake up! I want to buy a Yodel and this lottery ticket.
Homer Simpson,I have this much.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I am sorry, you do not have enough for both."
Homer Simpson,Oh... Oh... Ooo... Oh... Yodel.
Homer Simpson,"Late night, huh?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"I'm not the type to kiss and tell, sir, but listen to this..."
Homer Simpson,You dog.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,It is my mother!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, no! Oh, no! What am I going to do?!"
Homer Simpson,What's the big problem?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Bu... Don't you see?! She is here to meet my wife.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,The wife that I told her I had. I do not have a wife.
Homer Simpson,Then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, she's going to be here any second!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, yes, that'll buy me some time. Homer, you've got to help me!"
Homer Simpson,"Okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,What?! What?! What?! What?! What?!
Homer Simpson,"Wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that Marge is your wife."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Is it me, or do your plans always involve some horrible web of lies?"
Homer Simpson,It's you.
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Welcome to the Kwik-E-Mart. May I help... Mother! What are you doing here?
Apu's Mother,I have come to meet this wife of yours.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,And meet her you shall. It is a very reasonable request that can easily be granted in a timely and efficient...
Apu's Mother,Let's go.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"And go we shall, because it is in the going that we at-tat-tat-tat-tat!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that Yodel was so good. I wish I was eatin' it right now."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, crap, I forgot!"
Homer Simpson,"Marge, I need a small favor. For the next few days, will you pretend to be Apu's wife?"
Marge Simpson,What?!
Homer Simpson,Please? It's just for as long as his mother's living here.
Marge Simpson,What?!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Honey, I am in my home."
Marge Simpson,"How was your day, sweetheart?"
Homer Simpson,Can you feel the love?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Mother, I would like for you to meet my darling wife of many, many good years, Mmmarge."
Marge Simpson,Hello. So... What brings you to America?
Apu's Mother,I have come to see the woman for whom Apu was willing to disgrace his family and spit on his culture.
Marge Simpson,Ohhhh. Here I am!
Homer Simpson,"Okay, gotta run. Apu, I'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before Marge yells at you again."
Marge Simpson,I'm just so honored to have you here in our home.
Apu's Mother,"Thank you. And having met you, let me say how deeply, deeply disappointed I am. Apu, your arranged bride Manjula is a sweet, refined, chaste woman! Are you nuts?"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Ach, Mother, come on, you know that one out of every 25 arranged marriages ends in divorce. Heh."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, Bart and Lisa! You remember your father, Apu. Well, this is your father, Apu's mother."
Lisa Simpson,Ohhhh. / Hiiiii.
Apu's Mother,I cannot believe you did not tell me I had two grandchildren.
Maggie Simpson,
Homer Simpson,But you can't leave! We're scammin' an old lady at my house and I need a place to hide out.
Moe Szyslak,"Ah, sorry Homer, I've been planning this vacation for years. I'm finally gonna see Easter Island."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. With the giant heads."
Moe Szyslak,With the what now?

Orderly,Abraham Simpson. Cornelius Talmadge.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, I'm not... Oh, well, let's see whatcha got here."
Grampa Simpson,The pink ones keep ya from screamin'.
Orderly,"All right, folks, it's supper time."
Homer Simpson,"Supper at 4 o'clock? Oh-ho, what a sweet deal!"
Homer Simpson,"Hey! They got chairs with wheels, and here I am using my legs like a sucker!"
,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, I must apologize for the inconvenience, Marge. You are a real sport."
Marge Simpson,Right. How much longer is she gonna be here? Homer was a little sketchy on the details.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, it should not be more than a few days. She really, truly hates you."
Lisa Simpson,Can I ask you about your dot?
Apu's Mother,What would you like to know?
Lisa Simpson,What's the deal with that dot?
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, can you see out of it? Does it change colors when you're ticked off?"
Apu's Mother,You tell me.
Bart Simpson,Nothing yet.
Apu's Mother,"Surely, you children are aware of your Brahman heritage."
Bart Simpson,"As long as you have absolutely no follow-up questions... yes. Yes, we are."
Lisa Simpson,Fully. We have to go now.
Homer Simpson,"Jasper. Gladys. Beatrice. Lookin' good, Hattie. Asa. Hazel. Hazel! Hazel!"
Homer Simpson,"Oh, the hell with her. Hester. Emil. Prudence. Lemuel. Increase. Dad."
Grampa Simpson,Cornelius.
Orderly,Supper time!
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no you don't."
Jasper Beardly,"Oh, yes I do."
Homer Simpson,Eat my dust!
Orderly,"Wow, someone sure likes his kidney mush."
Homer Simpson,Damn right.
Homer Simpson,Mmm. Who knew that Lay's made liquid potato chips? I can't suck just one.
Nurse,"Another bag of chips, Mr. Talmadge?"
Homer Simpson,"Please. Also, I think I'm getting a bedsore. What do you have to do to get turned around here?"
Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's Lucky hooked up to?"
Nurse,A respirator. It breathes for him.
Homer Simpson,And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker! And how come everyone gets a bedpan and I have to walk all the way over there?
Nurse,You mean there?
Homer Simpson,Yeah!
Elderly Gentleman,"Hello, I'm Cornelius Talmadge. My family brought me here on Monday, but I broke free and went on a bit of a bender."
Nurse,"Wait a minute, if you're Cornelius Talmadge, then who's...?"
,
Homer Simpson,"When I get old, Marge, I want you to promise you'll put me in a home. It's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm glad you were having fun, because I've had my hands full with Apu's mother."
Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, right, right. The fake marriage thing. How's that goin'?"
Apu's Mother,"Okay Apu, I am packed and ready to go to the airpor..."
Apu's Mother,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, my God!"
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Marge, how could you?!"
Marge Simpson,"Oh Apu, give it up."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Mother, I am so sorry. I lied to you about being married."
Homer Simpson,Lied to his mother.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,But the fact that I would stage this ridiculous farce surely proves to you how much I do not want to go through with this arranged marriage.
Apu's Mother,"I had no idea how strongly you felt, Apu."
Apu's Mother,Now wipe that smile off your face. We have a wedding to plan.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,
Homer Simpson,"You know what you could do, Apu..."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Yeah, shut up."
Homer Simpson,You could fake your own death...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, would you shut up."
Homer Simpson,All you need is a car bomb and...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,I can't believe you don't shut up.
Apu's Mother,"Yes, yes, Manjula, I will take care of all the wedding plans. You just get on the plane and come to America..."
Apu's Mother,"I have to go. Believe me, I'd like to."
Marge Simpson,"I've been looking over this list of things for the ceremony. I've got the extra wine glasses, but I'm still short a tandoori oven, an elephant, and four castrati."
Bart Simpson,What's a castrati?
Marge Simpson,"I don't know, but I'm sure it's spicy."
Lisa Simpson,Why is that woman still living here?
Bart Simpson,I unno.

Lenny Leonard,"Hey, you seen Apu lately? He looks terrible."
Carl Carlson,"Yeah, rumor has it Marge threw him out."
Barney Gumble,"Aw, tough break. She's a beautiful lady."
Moe Szyslak,"You got that straight, Barn."
Barney Gumble,To Marge!
Homer Simpson,"Moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?"
Moe Szyslak,"Booze, booze and more booze."
Lenny Leonard,Ha! Nothin' like a depressant to chase the blues away.
Lenny Leonard,"Yeah, you got that... / Oh yeah. / Uh-huh."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oof, Manjula and I have not seen each other in twenty years. Two people cannot fall in love sight-unseen."
Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hold on there! I'm countin' on that."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left..."
Homer Simpson,"Actually, it's more like twelve. No, I'm so stupid, seven. It's seven hours. You have seven hours. See? Seven."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"""WELL, I'M HOT BLOODED / CHECK IT AND SEE / I'VE GOT A FEVER OF A HUNDRED AND THREE..."""
Homer Simpson,C'mon. You shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
Homer Simpson,You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.
Homer Simpson,"Ahh. Is this the life, or what?"
Jasper Beardly,You want me to turn on the bubbles?
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Which Bombay to Springfield flight is she on? The 10 o'clock, the 10:15, or the 10:30?"
Clerk,"Oh, I am so terribly sorry, sir. It appears that your tiger has been sent to St. Louis."
Siegfried,"Uh-huh, I should send you to St. Louis!"
Roy,No! No! He's not worth it!
Clerk,Can you please indicate your tiger-type on this chart?
Roy,Number 6.
,
Apu's Mother,How's that fire ring coming? Is it sacred yet?
Bart Simpson,Almost...
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Can you believe it? Tradition forbids me even to speak to the woman I am about to spend my life with. Hmf, has the whole world gone crazy?"
Homer Simpson,"Nah, just your screwy country."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Your old friend Apu is a lamb being led to the slaughter.
Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oof, I am really doomed. Only the gods could stop this wedding now."
Homer Simpson,"Gods, eh?"
Moe Szyslak,"No, no, no, no, no. No pansies for me."
Lisa Simpson,It's the tradition in India.
Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, all right. It'll cover the gravy stains."
Moe Szyslak,Hey!
Bart Simpson,Tradition.
Marge Simpson,"Thanks for helping us out, Reverend. I know you've never performed a Hindu ceremony..."
Stephen Jay Gould,Inconclusive.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Well, Christ is Christ. Plus, I consulted a Hindu web site."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Hello, everyone... What a happy, happy day."
Bart Simpson,Wow! I wish I had an elephant.
Lisa Simpson,You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.
Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah."
Guests,
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Lucky mouse.
Guests,So beautiful. / Etc.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, Manjula?!"
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Apu. Remember me?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Ooobviously not.
Ganesh,"I am the god, Ganesh! This wedding angers me. All will die unless it is stopped."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, God."
Ganesh,Please listen to me.
Burly Guest,
Ganesh,Stop chasing Ganesh! You're just gonna get more wrath!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, I'm afraid this is all my fault, Manjula. To be perfectly honest with you, I have not exactly been looking forward to this arranged marriage."
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Nor have I. Marrying a complete stranger? It is crazy.
Apu's Mother,"All right, Ganesh has been subdued."
Ganesh,All will die...
Apu's Mother,Resume the ceremony.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, quickly, tell me, what is your favorite movie, book, and food?"
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,"The answer to all three is ""Fried Green Tomatoes."""
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oo, that... that is good."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Double parked.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, I am so torn. You are clearly so quick-witted and beautiful."
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,"And when I look in your eyes, I see that sweet little boy who sold me my very first kiss... and I liked it."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Oh, do you think this marriage could really work?"
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Who knows? We can always get divorced.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Of course! God bless America!

Homer Simpson,Screw him.
Homer Simpson,Put me down! Ganesh commands you! Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,"Well, so far, so good. Don't you think? I cannot wait to show you our apartment."
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,"Apartment? Oh no, no, no. You must buy me a house. And you're getting a haircut."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,Oh!
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon,Got you.
Homer Simpson,"Come on, elephant. Put me down! Hey, everyone seems upside down."

Chief Wiggum,"Ha! Ha! This sting can't miss, boys. I mailed these bogus prize certificates to every scofflaw in Springfield."
Chief Wiggum,"When they show up for their ""free motorboats,"" we arrest them and beat them to the full extent of the law."
Eddie,"So, the hook is baited, huh?"
Lou,"Heh. Nice metaphor, Eddie."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, good work, Eddie."
,
Homer Simpson,"""Up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt..."" Da-da-da-da-da."
Bart Simpson,But we didn't enter any police raffle.
Homer Simpson,That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.
Marge Simpson,I don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
Homer Simpson,Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.
,
Homer Simpson,"I'd like a yellow boat, please. With extra motors."
Snake Jailbird,"Yo. No cuts, bro. Where's my motorboat, pig?"
Chief Wiggum,"Uh, right through that door."
Snake Jailbird,"What the... Yo! Ouch! Oh, I call brutality on you!"
Chief Wiggum,"All right, uh, Simpson, Homer. You're next."
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson,"Howdy, gents! I'm here to collect my free--"
Homer Simpson,OW! OW! My boating arm! What's going on?
Chief Wiggum,"You're under arrest, slimebag. What's this perp in for, Lou?"
Lou,"Uh, 235 unpaid parking tickets. Totaling 175 dollars."
Chief Wiggum,"Ha, I hope you brought your checkbook, wise guy."
Homer Simpson,"Lousy cops. Lucky for you I'm double-parked or I'd... There. Now, can I please have my motorboat?"
,
Bart Simpson,Dad? Why aren't you saying anything? Where's our motorboat?
Homer Simpson,I didn't like it. The mast had termites.
Lisa Simpson,Why would a motorboat have a mast?
Homer Simpson,Because... the thingee was... shut up.
Marge Simpson,"Ooo, there's that new mega-mall they're building! They say the air conditioner will be more powerful than a million hydrogen bombs."
Lisa Simpson,"Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!"
Homer Simpson,Fossils shmossils. You can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. Bones shmones.
Lisa Simpson,"But they might be paving over rare specimens. Pull over so we can complain, Dad. Come on, who wants to complain with me?"
Lisa Simpson,Fine. I'll come back later. Who wants to come back with me? Fine.
,
Lisa Simpson,"My attorney, Lionel Hutz, calls your attention to Municipal Code 147-c: ""Protection of antiquities and fossils."""
Lionel Hutz,That's right.
Mall Executive,"There aren't any fossils here, little girl. Museum folks dug 'em all up years ago."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, but what if they missed something? You have to allow an archeological survey!"
Mall Executive,Who's gonna make us? You?
Lionel Hutz,
Pr Man,"Now, hold on, Sid. Hold on. Maybe we should let the kid dig. Could be good publicity."
Pr Man,"All right. / Yeah. / Oh, yeah. / We could do that."
Mall Executive,Okay. You want to dig? Be my guest.
Lionel Hutz,Fine! We'll see you in court.
Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Hutz, we won."
Lionel Hutz,We?
,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Principal Skinner, remember how I didn't sue when I found that scorpion in my applesauce? Well, I'm calling in a favor."
Seymour Skinner,Hmm. I knew this day would come.
,
Seymour Skinner,Attention. All honor students will be rewarded with a trip to an archeological dig!
Terri Mackleberry,Yay!
Seymour Skinner,"Conversely, all detention students will be punished with a trip to an archeological dig."
Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, why? / Oh, no, not tomorrow. / Aw, crud."
,
Jimbo Jones,Gonna dig me a hole...
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Gonna dig me a hole.
Jimbo Jones,Gonna put a nerd in it...
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Gonna put a nerd in it.
Jimbo Jones,Gonna take a firecracker...
Kearney Zzyzwicz,Gonna take a firecracker.
Lisa Simpson,This is so exciting! I can't wait to see what we find!
Seymour Skinner,"I must admit, it is rather exciting. And -- Why, look -- here's something right here!"
Seymour Skinner,"It appears to be some sort of rock. I-- Oh, no, it's just a clump of dirt. Even so, my heart is pounding like a kettle drum. I'd better sit down for a moment."
Ralph Wiggum,Princeskipper Skipple! Prinnipple Skimsker! I found something!
Ralph Wiggum,It's a spearhead!
Miss Hoover,"That's your trowel blade, Ralph. It fell off the handle."
Ralph Wiggum,And I found it!
Lisa Simpson,"Okay, everyone! Back to work! You never know when we might uncover a Tyrannosaurus."
Seymour Skinner,"Well, this was a big bust. Come on, kids. Let's go home to our mothers."
Lisa Simpson,Don't give up! I'm sure we'll find something!
Marge Simpson,The police auction...
Lisa Simpson,"C'mon, c'mon! A bottle cap, a shoe, a bar of gold, anything! She suddenly uncovers a white patch."
Lisa Simpson,Everybody! Come quick!
Crowd,"What is it? / What? / That's unbelievable. / Oh, this is nice. / Wow."
Homer Simpson,Lemme through! I got here late!
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Hmm, from the looks of it, I'd say this fellow died from causes unknown."
Lisa Simpson,"Look, there's more. What the heck is this thing?"
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Speaking from a strictly medical point of view, that ain't right."
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, my goodness."
Milhouse Van Houten,"What is it, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,It looks like a human skeleton... but these other bones look almost like wings.
Ned Flanders,You mean like... an angel?!!
Lisa Simpson,"Well, obviously that's impossible--"
Moe Szyslak,Lisa's right! It's an angel!
Homer Simpson,Now that's interesting.
Lisa Simpson,But it can't be an angel!
Moe Szyslak,"Oh, no? Well if you're so sure what it ain't, how 'bout tellin' us what it am?"
Crowd,Yeah! / What am it? / etc.
Lisa Simpson,"Well, maybe it's, uh, uh... a Neanderthal, who got bitten by some angry fish."
Caveman,Hmm?
Caveman,Ah! Ow! Ow! Ah!
Ned Flanders,"Oh-ho, I gotta say, Lisa, it sounds like you're strainin' to do some explainin'."
Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, everyone's heard of angels. But who's ever heard of a ""Neanderthal""?"
Lisa Simpson,It could be anything. It could be a mutant from the nuclear plant.
C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, fiddle-faddle. Everyone knows our mutants have flippers. Oops. I've said too much. Smithers, use the amnesia ray."
Waylon Smithers,"You mean the revolver, sir?"
C. Montgomery Burns,Precisely. And be sure to wipe your own memory clear when you're finished.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Now, regardless of what this thing is, it's a priceless scientific find. So our most pressing concern now is determining who owns such a valuable skeleton. And I'd like to suggest that I do."
Lisa Simpson,Hey! / What are you...? / Wait a minute. / Wait! Wait! Wait! / Settle down! / No! No! No! / Excuse me! / No! No!
Sideshow Mel,I'd like to hear from Lionel Hutz!
Lionel Hutz,"It's a thorny legal issue, all right. I'll need to refer to the case of Finders vs. Keepers."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
Homer Simpson,"So long, suckers!"
,
Homer Simpson,"Come on... Come on, Angel."
Marge Simpson,What are you doing with that?
Homer Simpson,I'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables.
Homer Simpson,I'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
Bart Simpson,"It's probably a million years old, Dad. I think it's as valuable as it's gonna get."
Homer Simpson,"Pfft. That's what they said about this Billy Beer, smartypants."
Homer Simpson,Ahh. We elected the wrong Carter.
Kent Brockman,"Coming up next... an hilarious ""boat giveaway"" scam nets Springfield's dumbest criminals!"
Homer Simpson,Sounds like goood watchin'.
Ned Flanders,"Hey-hey there, Marge. Just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
Homer Simpson,"Get your own angel, ya moocher."
Ned Flanders,"Thanks anyway, Homer."
Marge Simpson,"Oh, hello, Agnes."
Agnes Skinner,"Sorry to trouble you, but I'm goin' in for surgery tomorrow, and I wondered if I could rub the angel with my foot for good luck. It's foot surgery."
Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm trying to eat here. Beat it, Pegleg!"
Agnes Skinner,Jackass. Marge.
Crowd,"Hey, we want to see the angel! / Come on, we want to see the angel! / I would like to... / Angel! Angel! Angel!"
Lenny Leonard,"C'mon, Homer. I just want a quick look-see. Pay ya a buck..."
Homer Simpson,"A buck, eh? That gives me an idea..."
Homer Simpson,"Fifty cents, please."
,
Lisa Simpson,"Ahh, here's Dr. Gould now. What were the results, Professor?"
Homer Simpson,HEEERE'S THE ANGEL! / SEEEE THE ANGEL / IT'S MY ANGEL / NO ONE ELSE'S / NEXT TO-OO TH-E RAKES!
Lisa Simpson,"Dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. There's no proof of that."
Homer Simpson,"No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word ""angel""."
Lisa Simpson,What about that sign right there?
Homer Simpson,That's a typo.
Lisa Simpson,Just let me take it to the museum for one day. They can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose out on bags and bags of money. It's sacrilegious, I tell ya."
,
,
,
,
Lisa Simpson,Wow... so lifelike.
,
Stephen Jay Gould,Astonishing. Simply astonishing. One of the most singular specimens I've encountered in all my distinguished career.
Stephen Jay Gould,"But enough about my work. What did you want to show me, Lisa?"
Lisa Simpson,It's a bone scraping from that skeleton I found.
Stephen Jay Gould,"Oh yeah, the so-called ""angel."" The whole thing's preposterous, of course."
Lisa Simpson,Quite preposterous. But no one will believe me until I can prove what it really is. Can't you do a DNA test or something?
Stephen Jay Gould,Certainly. I'll have the results by tomorrow.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, thank you so much! Uhm... you know I can't afford to pay you."
Stephen Jay Gould,I didn't become a scientist for financial gain. Whatever little money you have will be just fine.
,
Carl Carlson,"I say it's the Angel of Peace, ya idiot!"
Lenny Leonard,"And I say it's the Angel of Mercy, you jerk!"
Lisa Simpson,Excuse me. I took a piece of the skeleton for scientific analysis. Soon we will have all the facts.
Crowd,You did what? / Analysis? / I don't like her.
Homer Simpson,Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.
Stephen Jay Gould,
Lisa Simpson,Inconclusive? Then why did you come running up like that?
Stephen Jay Gould,Can I use your bathroom?
Lisa Simpson,
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Well. It appears science has faltered once again in the face of overwhelming religious evidence.
Lisa Simpson,But--
Moe Szyslak,"Go home, science girl."
Lisa Simpson,I am home.
Moe Szyslak,Good. Stay there.
Homer Simpson,"Okay, folks. Get your angel glow sticks! No one gets into heaven without a glow stick!"
Ned Flanders,I'll take four!
Lisa Simpson,"Ugh, those morons make me so angry."
Marge Simpson,"Maybe so, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't call them morons."
Lisa Simpson,But they are morons. What grown person could believe in angels?
Marge Simpson,"Well... your mother, for one."
Lisa Simpson,"You? But... you're an intelligent person, Mom."
Marge Simpson,"There has to be more to life than just what we see, Lisa. Everyone needs something to believe in."
Lisa Simpson,It's not that I don't have a spiritual side. I just find it hard to believe there's a dead angel hanging in our garage.
Marge Simpson,"My poor Lisa. If you can't make a leap of faith now and then, well... I feel sorry for you."
Lisa Simpson,"Don't feel sorry for me, Mom. I feel sorry for you."
Kent Brockman,"Next on Smartline: ""The Springfield Angel Controversy""."
Kent Brockman,"Our guest tonight, making her 13th appearance on Smartline... Miss Lisa Simpson."
Lisa Simpson,Kent.
Kent Brockman,"Miss Simpson, how can you maintain your skepticism in spite of the fact that this thing really, really looks like an angel?"
Lisa Simpson,"I just think it's a fantasy. If you believe in angels, then why not unicorns, or sea monsters, or leprechauns?"
Kent Brockman,"Ohh, that's a buncha baloney, Lisa. Everyone knows leprechauns are extinct."
Lisa Simpson,"Look, you can either accept science and face reality, or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world."
,
Bart Simpson,We should have lived together first.
Moe Szyslak,Science! What's science ever done for us? TV off.
Ned Flanders,"Science is like a blabbermouth who ruins a movie by telling you how it ends. Well, I say there are some things we don't want to know! Important things!"
Crowd,Yeah! / Science stinks! / Down with science! / Etc.
Agnes Skinner,Enough talk. It's smashin' time!
Moe Szyslak,Take that! And that! And...
Moe Szyslak,Ooo! Ow! I'm paralyzed! I just hope medical science can cure me.
Robot,Why?! Why was I programmed to feel pain?!
Kent Brockman,Technocrats are learning a lesson in humility tonight as angel supporters lay waste to Springfield's scientific institutions.
,
Lisa Simpson,"Ugh, I wish I'd never found those stupid bones! It's time to put an end to this. Bart, I'm borrowing your blue crowbar."
Bart Simpson,Good ol' Bluey.
Marge Simpson,"Hey, she's gonna smash the angel!"
Homer Simpson,Somebody stop her!
Lisa Simpson,It's gone...
Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho, no! This can't be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?"
Bart Simpson,I could take up smoking.
Homer Simpson,You damn well better!
Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, don't panic. Marge, stop panicking. We need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. Bart! Strip down to your skeleton!"
Ned Flanders,"We've come for the angel, Homer. It's not safe with the unbeliever."
Moe Szyslak,It's gone! We're too late!
Mayor Joe Quimby,"Little girl, what have you done with our precious angel?"
Lisa Simpson,Nothing. Someone must have stolen it.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Looks to me like Lisa Simpson found something science couldn't explain. So she had to destroy it.
Chief Wiggum,"Well, that's all the evidence I need. Arrest the girl!"
Marge Simpson,What?! She didn't do anything.
Bart Simpson,"Give her a nice cell. Somethin' in ""C"" block."
,
Marge Simpson,Well... you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.
Judge Snyder,"Lisa Simpson, you are charged with destruction of an historic curiosity, a misdemeanor. But in a larger sense, this trial will settle the age-old question of Science vs. Religion. Let the opening statements commence."
Blue-Haired Lawyer,"Your honor, over the coming weeks and months, we intend to prove Lisa Simpson willfully destroyed--"
Lenny Leonard,There's the angel!
,
,
Lenny Leonard,Wowwww. Do you think it flew up here?
Moe Szyslak,"Well, it didn't ride up on no zebra."
Homer Simpson,Look! A message!
Homer Simpson,"""The end will come at sundown."" Heh heh heh heh. Hey, wait a second. I don't like the sound of that."
Ralph Wiggum,"I'm scared, Daddy. Too scared to even wet my pants."
Chief Wiggum,"It's okay, son. Just relax and it'll come."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,Even Lisa Simpson must now agree we have witnessed a miracle.
Lisa Simpson,Hardly. Anyone could have written that.
Homer Simpson,"Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan."
Ned Flanders,"Reverend, I've got to admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Oh, now be calm, Ned. But be afraid also. Tremendously afraid. For the day of reckoning is upon us."
Crowd,"/ Reckoning? / Oh, no! / Oh!"
,
Aide,"Your Holiness, there is word from America. They say an angel has foretold the apocalypse."
The Pope,"Uhm, keep an eye on it."
,
Edna Krabappel,"This could be our last day together, my love. How about a farewell romp in the garden of earthly delights?"
Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup, you read my mind. Just, uh, give me twenty minutes, or so, to finish these tardy slips."
,
Bart Simpson,"Why are we getting dressed up, Mom? Are we going to Black Angus?"
Bart Simpson,So we're not going to Black Angus.
Lisa Simpson,"Will you leave me alone? It's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid ""Judgment Day""."
Marge Simpson,"Please, Lisa. I don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but I really wish we could make peace before sunset."
Lisa Simpson,"Nothing is going to happen, Mom. I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end."
,
Ned Flanders,"Well, shall we sing a hymn? Uh, ""Nearer My God to Thee"", maybe? Or, or, or ""Amazing Grace""?"
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy,"Uhm, nah."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, don't let go, no matter what. If they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too."
Chief Wiggum,Ten seconds till sundown.
Selma Bouvier,We did it. We beat cancer.
Waylon Smithers,"Ohh, what the hell."
Chief Wiggum,SEVEN... SIX...
Crowd,FIVE... FOUR... THREE... TWO... ONE...
Crowd,What the...? / What the...? / What was that? / What gives? / Nothin' happened. / What went on?
Lisa Simpson,"Well, there you go. I hope you all learned a val--"
Angel,SILENCE!
Angel,PREPARE FOR THE END!
Angel,THE END OF HIGH PRICES!
Crowd,What? / What the heck is he talkin' about? / Wait a minute.
Angel,BEHOLD!
Angel,THE GRAND OPENING OF THE HEAVENLY HILLS MALL!
Mall Executive,Please follow the angel for all your shopping needs.
Lisa Simpson,Wait a second! You planted a phony skeleton for me to find! This was all a big hoax.
Mall Executive,Not a hoax. A publicity stunt!
Lisa Simpson,"You exploited people's deepest beliefs just to hawk your cheesy wares?! Well, we are outraged! Aren't we?!"
Chief Wiggum,"Oh, oh yeah, yeah, we're outraged. Very, uh... Very much so... But look at all the stores! A Pottery Barn!"
Moe Szyslak,"And twenty per cent off everything? Hey, does that include rat spray?"
Mall Executive,Oh yeah.
Agnes Skinner,"Outta my way, Shorty!"
Crowd,"Hey! / Hey! / Hey, I was here first! / We need a mall for everyone. / There are millions of them."
,
Lisa Simpson,"I don't understand, Professor. Why didn't your tests show the skeleton was a fake?"
Stephen Jay Gould,"I'm gonna be honest with you, Lisa. I never did the tests."
,
Waylon Smithers,"Uh, sir, ah, about that, uh, ah, that kiss. I-hi-hi, I hope you understand it was merely a sign of my respect."
C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, of course."
Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess you were right, honey. But you have to admit, when that angel started to talk, you were squeezing my hand pretty hard."
Lisa Simpson,"Well, it was just so loud and... Heh, heh, heh... Thanks for sqeezing back."
Marge Simpson,"Any time, my angel."
,
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, I love these lazy Saturdays."
Marge Simpson,"It's Wednesday, Homer."
Homer Simpson,Work!
Homer Simpson,"Ahh, I love these real Saturdays. They're so relaxing. Not like that fake Saturday that almost got me fired."
Marge Simpson,Is this all we're going to do today?
Homer Simpson,Absolutely.
Marge Simpson,"You know, Homer, I'm starting to realize life is short."
Homer Simpson,It is?
Marge Simpson,We have to make the most of the time we have.
Homer Simpson,We do?
Marge Simpson,"Otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, that."
Homer Simpson,Ah.
Marge Simpson,Friends of the Library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.
Homer Simpson,Pfft. Friends of the library?
Marge Simpson,Ooo... Oo! There's an Azalea festival at the public garden!
Homer Simpson,I went yesterday.
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,Lenny really wanted to go.
Marge Simpson,I'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time!
Homer Simpson,Open a window.
Marge Simpson,
Homer Simpson,"Allll right, I hear ya, honey. Change into something nice. We're steppin' out!"
Homer Simpson,Can you believe it? It's already been a year.
,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, sweetheart. Look at all this seized booty. We could find the drug boat of our dreams!"
Marge Simpson,I don't want a drug boat.
Homer Simpson,"Well, I bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!"
Chief Wiggum,"All right, listen up. L-listen up! These prestigious wrought-iron security gates are bullet-proof, bomb-proof, and battering ram-resistant. Now..."
Seymour Skinner,Then what happened to Johnny D?
Chief Wiggum,"He forgot to lock 'em. Now, what am I bid?"
SOUTH AMERICAN BIDDER,One kilo.
Chief Wiggum,Sold!
Johnny D,Aye-aye-aye! My gates! Aye! Johnny C gave me those.
Snake Jailbird,"Tough break, amigo."
Chief Wiggum,Next item up for bids...
Crowd,
Snake Jailbird,Ohhh nooo.
Johnny D,"Oh, hey, look. They're selling your car, man. Boy, it's nice."
Snake Jailbird,"Oh, I will totally kill whoever buys Li'l Bandit!"
Chief Wiggum,Sold!
Homer Simpson,Woo hoo!
Marge Simpson,You bought a car?! Without consulting me?!
Homer Simpson,I don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.
Marge Simpson,I found this hat!
Homer Simpson,Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm-hm-hm.
,
Marge Simpson,"Homer, be careful..."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. You've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this...."
Marge Simpson,"Stop, Homer! Stop it! Let me out!"
Homer Simpson,You're the boss.
Marge Simpson,I'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
Homer Simpson,Okay-bye-love-you.
Lionel Hutz,"You know, if you lived here, you'd be home by now."
Marge Simpson,Mr. Hutz! I didn't know you sold real estate.
Lionel Hutz,"You didn't? We should talk more often, Marge."
Lionel Hutz,"You see, the law business is a little slow, and since most of my clients wind up losing their houses, this was a natural move for me."
Marge Simpson,Helping people find homes... That must be really rewarding.
Lionel Hutz,"Yes, the money is good. But the beauty is you get to stay in the house until it's sold."
Lionel Hutz,"C'mon, guys. Let's go for a swim."
,
Moe Szyslak,"Geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from Sunday. Never had you figured for a gear-head, Homer."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah. I'm a real expert."
Moe Szyslak,What is that? A six-barrel Hollye carb?
Homer Simpson,You betcha.
Moe Szyslak,Edelbrock intakes...
Homer Simpson,Nothin' but.
Moe Szyslak,Meyerhof lifters...
Homer Simpson,Oh yeah.
Moe Szyslak,I made that last one up.
Homer Simpson,I see.
,
Marge Simpson,Selling real estate could be just what I'm looking for. I'd really like to give it a try.
Homer Simpson,"I don't know, Marge. Trying is the first step toward failure."
Marge Simpson,"Oh boy, I've got a lot to learn before that license test."
Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, Mom. We'll help you study."
Bart Simpson,"'Course, we'll have to cut back on our own homework."
Marge Simpson,"What in the heck is a ""dwelling""?"
Marge Simpson,"So, you're married and you're looking for your first house, Mr. and Mrs..."
Bart Simpson,Superman.
Lisa Simpson,"Oh, don't listen to my husband. He's just an idiot. Now, I'm a veterinarian and I need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. Is that permitted?"
Bart Simpson,Not in my damn house.
Marge Simpson,"Well, this neighborhood is zoned R-3, which allows dogs, cats, phone-answering monkeys, and, oh... Oh I'll never memorize all this."
Lisa Simpson,"When I had to learn about the Magna Carta, I made up a song. ""In 1215 at Runnymede!/ Doo dah, doo dah/ The nobles and the King agreed!/ Oh, d-doo dah day..."""
,
Lisa Simpson,"""On the closing day!/ The escrow agents pay!/ Taxes, liens, and interest, too, thanks to Fannie Mae!"""
Bart Simpson,They back your baaaannk!
Homer Simpson,You're all nuts.
,
,
Marge Simpson,Easement!
City Clerk,Time's up. You may now undermine each other's confidence.
Captain Horatio McCallister,Yarrr. I nailed that one about houseboats! Did you?
,
Marge Simpson,I passed!
Lisa Simpson,Yay!/ Way to go!
Marge Simpson,"Oh, thank you Bart, thank you Lisa, for all your help!"
Homer Simpson,What about me? You didn't thank me.
Bart Simpson,You didn't do anything.
Homer Simpson,I like being thanked.
,
Lionel Hutz,"Welcome to the big leagues, Marge. There's over 50 years of real estate experience right in this room. And 42 of those years are Gil's."
Gil Gunderson,"Marge, it's a real pleasure. You got any leads? I need some leads. Please, help me."
Lionel Hutz,"That's enough, Gil. Don't drag her down with you."
Lionel Hutz,That's Cookie Kwan. She's number one on the west side.
Cookie,"Hi, Marge. Stay off the west side."
Lionel Hutz,And there's Nick Callahan.
Marge Simpson,A headset telephone?! I thought those only existed in the movies!
Nick,Boo-ya! Guess who sold the Whitman place?!
Assorted Agents,"Good for you, Nick! / H-h-hey! Way to go! / Way to go!"
Gil Gunderson,I've been working on the Whitman place for 21 years.
Lionel Hutz,"And now, Marge, I'd like to welcome you to the family, with your very own red blazer."
Marge Simpson,For me?
Assorted Agents,"Whoa-ho-ho! / Hey! / Go, Marge!"
Marge Simpson,"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I'm going to do my darndest to uphold the principles and ideals this jacket represents."
Nick,I give her a week.
Cookie,Are you guys talking about the west side?
Gil Gunderson,"No, Cookie. I swear it. I'm scared of you."
,
Lisa Simpson,Ah! Dad! Doesn't this car have seat belts?
Homer Simpson,Seat belts?! Pfft! They kill more people than they save.
Lisa Simpson,That's not true. You're thinking of airbags.
Marge Simpson,There it is!
Lisa Simpson,Wow! / Your own billboard! / Check it out!
Homer Simpson,"Gee, that picture makes your butt look big."
Marge Simpson,"I thought so too, but they said it sells."
Bart Simpson,Works for the Lumber King.
Homer Simpson,Lumber. We need lumber.
,
Marge Simpson,"Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak, have you ever considered selling your home?"
Moe Szyslak,What? No. Why? What? Why? What have you heard? Are you implyin' I'm in some sort of financial trouble?
Marge Simpson,No.
Moe Szyslak,"Well, I am. Let me have that card."
,
Marge Simpson,"And here we have a lovely gourmet kitchen, with gas range, central can-opener, and foam under-flooring for enhanced standability."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Why, isn't this kitchen horribly cramped?"
Marge Simpson,"Why, yes it is..."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Well, I suppose we could get used to it."
Marge Simpson,"Yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle. You know, I've always loved the house you're in now."
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"Really? Well, maybe we should stay put. Thanks for your honesty, Marge."
Marge Simpson,My pleasure.
Dr. Julius Hibbert,"If you ever need a prescription, no questions asked..."
Sideshow Mel,"Good shot, Barbara! I can't believe it. A house with a bowling alley!"
Marge Simpson,Do you bowl often?
Sideshow Mel,"Actually, this is our first time. And I didn't really care for it."
Marge Simpson,"Oh. Well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right house for you?"
Lionel Hutz,And what really fries me is you returned his check!
Sideshow Mel,I suppose not. I guess we were just captivated by this delightful plaque.
Sideshow Mel,
,
Homer Simpson,"Hey, Skinner! Wanna drag race?"
Seymour Skinner,My high school sweetheart was killed in a drag racing accident.
Homer Simpson,Come on! It'll be fun!
Seymour Skinner,That's what Debbie Sue said...
Homer Simpson,Come on... you... stupid... car... you... get... goin'...
Snake Jailbird,"Oh, that's Li'l Bandit! And she's in pain!"
Snake Jailbird,Screw the honor system. My car needs me.
Kearney Zzyzwicz,"Hey, you're ruinin' it for the rest of us."
Snake Jailbird,Stop! That's my car!
,
,
Lionel Hutz,"Marge, I had a lot of calls about you. Customers love your no-pressure approach."
Marge Simpson,"Well, like we say, the right house for the right person!"
Lionel Hutz,"Listen, it's time I let you in on a little secret, Marge: the right house is the house that's for sale. The right person is anyone."
Marge Simpson,But... all I did was tell the truth.
Lionel Hutz,Of course you did. But there's the truth and the truth. Let me show you.
Marge Simpson,It's awfully small.
Lionel Hutz,"I'd say it's awfully ""cozy."""
Marge Simpson,That's dilapidated.
Lionel Hutz,Rustic.
Marge Simpson,That house is on fire.
Lionel Hutz,Motivated seller.
Marge Simpson,That's a beauty.
Lionel Hutz,Forget about that house. That's the murder house.
Marge Simpson,"Ooo, I remember. Mrs. Astor was very lucky."
Lionel Hutz,"Well, no one expects you to sell that house. But you better sell something."
Lionel Hutz,"Because cubicles are for closers, Marge. Anybody who doesn't sell a house their first week gets fired. I probably should have mentioned that earlier."
,
Homer Simpson,Lousy doormat.
Marge Simpson,I thought I'd do anything to succeed in business. But bending the truth... I don't know.
Lisa Simpson,"Ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. Big deal."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, honey. Even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother."
Marge Simpson,"So that's how you see me? As a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world?"
Lisa Simpson,Um-hmmm.
Marge Simpson,"Well, I can too compete. And I'm going to sell a house. End of story."
Homer Simpson,"Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her clear the table in peace?"
Marge Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"The first house I have to show you is, uhm, a handyman's dream."
Marge Simpson,Because it's so dilapidated.
Ned Flanders,"Well, nothing's perfect, I sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
Maude Flanders,"Now, slow down Neddy. The home-buyers course said always look inside the house before buying."
Marge Simpson,"Well, there it is..."
Lenny Leonard,Please don't tell anyone how I live.
,
Maude Flanders,"Hm, it's awfully small."
Marge Simpson,"Some people would call it ""cozy."""
Ned Flanders,I guess it is sorta cute...
Marge Simpson,"But small. Really, really small."
Ned Flanders,"Hm. Wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
Marge Simpson,
Marge Simpson,"Well, that about does it for houses in this area..."
Maude Flanders,"Oh, wait, what about that house? That has a ""For Sale"" sign."
Ned Flanders,"Oooo, that's a dilly. How 'bout it, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,
,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, my-diddily-i. Will you look at this place! And the price has been slashed repeatedly!"
Maude Flanders,It's sure built solid. The kids could scream bloody murder and no one would hear.
Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Mr. Hutz, but I just can't lie to people."
Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm just gonna spill my guts: I love it to death! I'm gonna give you a deposit this minute."
Ned Flanders,Unless you can give me a reason not to?
Maude Flanders,"Is there anything else we should know, Marge?"
Lionel Hutz's Head,There's the truth and the truth...
Female Victim,No! Noooo!
Lionel Hutz's Head,If you don't sell a house you're fired... Fired... Fired...
Female Victim,
Ned Flanders,"Well, Marge?"
Marge Simpson,No. There is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.
Ned Flanders,That's good enough for me.
Ned Flanders,Purple drapes! All my life I've wanted purple drapes!
,
Lionel Hutz,Attention...
Lionel Hutz,"Ding-ding. Ding-ding. Ding-ding. Listen up, everybody. Marge Simpson sold her first house!"
Other Realtors,"Oh, that's very nice. / How 'bout that. / How nice."
Lionel Hutz,The murder house!
Other Realtors,"Whoa! / Wow! / Oh, my goodness. / Now that's something. / Boo-ya!"
Nick,"Wow, you must have told a whopper to unload that death trap."
Gil Gunderson,"What'd you use, Marge, huh? The old ""Buff 'n' Bluff?"" The ""Hail Murray?"" ""The Susquehanna Shuffle?"" Huh? Huh?"
Marge Simpson,"No, no. No tricks. It was salesmanship, that's all."
Lionel Hutz,"Sure, Marge. ""Salesmanship."""
Marge Simpson,But it was!
Lionel Hutz,"Sure, Marge. ""Was."""
Marge Simpson,"Look, just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits, doesn't mean the Flanders will be."
Other Realtors,"Eh, guess you're right. / Probably not. / Who cares?"
Lionel Hutz,"Well, whatever happens, as our newest closer, you're entitled to wear the coveted closing blazer..."
Lionel Hutz,And you get a third wall for your cubicle.
Gil Gunderson,But I earned that wall.
Lionel Hutz,"Don't push your luck, pal. You're hanging on by a thread."
Gil Gunderson,I brought this wall from home.
Snake Jailbird,"Ho-ho. Okay. Baldy boy hits wire, head comes off, Li'l Bandit rolls to a gentle stop. Everybody wins."
Homer Simpson,"Man, the air feels good on my neck!"
Homer Simpson,"Ooo, gumball."
Snake Jailbird,"Oh, why do I even bother?"
Kirk Van Houten,I told that idiot to slice my sandwich!
Kirk Van Houten,Oww!
,
Homer Simpson,"Wow, honey, you sold a house and got rid of the Flanders. What's for dinner?"
Ned Flanders,"Well, neighborinos, I guess this is goodbye... I better make this quick or I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, me too. Let me know if you need any help."
Ned Flanders,"Uh, now that you mention it, we could use..."
Homer Simpson,It was just an expression.
Marge Simpson,"Mmmm. Goodbye, Ned. If the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, I want you to call me right away. Or you can beep me. In fact, why don't you just stay here tonight? We'll go to a hotel."
Ned Flanders,"Oh, you're sweet to offer, but, uh, we're all just so tired, we just want to get to our new house and rest in peace."
Ned Flanders,"So long, Simpsons!"
Bart Simpson,So long! / Good-bye! / Good luck!
Homer Simpson,That old Flanders place gives me the creeps.
,
Homer Simpson,"""MY NAME IS LUKA, / I LIVE ON THE SECOND FLOOR..."""
Homer Simpson,
Snake Jailbird,"Gimme my car, fatty."
Homer Simpson,"This is my car! And I'm not fat, it's glandular!"
Snake Jailbird,Right.
,
Marge Simpson,
Dove,"You've got to tell them the truth, Marge. The truuuuth."
Marge Simpson,Hello? Anyone home?
Marge Simpson,
Ned Flanders,"Oh, hi, Marge. Heh-heh. Guess we gave you quite a start. We were painting Todd's room red -- pretty messy work -- and then we came out here to take a break. Must've dozed off."
Todd Flanders,Red room. Red room. Over here.
Lisa Simpson,
,
Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm just glad you're okay. And I have something to tell you..."
,
Homer Simpson,Stop it!
Snake Jailbird,Come on... Let's hear that snap!
Snake Jailbird,Ow!
Homer Simpson,You're...
Snake Jailbird,Ow!
Homer Simpson,...going...
Snake Jailbird,Ow!
Homer Simpson,...down...
Snake Jailbird,Ow!
Homer Simpson,...punk!
Snake Jailbird,Aw!
Snake Jailbird,Whoa! This is sooo dangerous.
Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right."
Chief Wiggum,What the...? This is Wiggum reporting a 318 -- waking a police officer.
,
Ned Flanders,This is the murder house?!
Marge Simpson,Mm-hmm.
Maude Flanders,"You mean the infamous ""Jealous Jockey Murders""?"
Marge Simpson,Mm-hmm.
Ned Flanders,"Ahh, of course! This must be where he dropped the dagger. And this is the butler's pantry where Mrs. Astor concealed herself. And right here's where they found the torso heap! In front of our very own fireplace!"
Maude Flanders,"Oh just think, Neddy. We're part of Springfield history!"
Rod Flanders,"Look, Daddy. I'm the Jealous Jockey!"
Todd Flanders,I'm a torso!
Marge Simpson,"I'm glad you're not mad, but I lied to you! And I won't feel right until I return your deposit."
Ned Flanders,"We appreciate the offer, Marge, but I think we're going to be very happy here."
Snake Jailbird,
Chief Wiggum,
Ned Flanders,"Uh, Marge? Still got that deposit check?"
Homer Simpson,"Oh. Oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap."
Chief Wiggum,"Hey, quit hoggin'!"
Snake Jailbird,"Ohh, I'm badly hurt."
,
Lionel Hutz,"A smashed hot rod?! A wrecked police cruiser?! A destroyed house?! I've had it with your renegade ways, Simpson! You're a loose cannon!"
Marge Simpson,But I...
Lisa Simpson,
Lionel Hutz,"You're one of a kind, Marge. And nobody deserves this more than you."
Marge Simpson,
,
Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm proud of you, Mom. You refused to compromise your integrity."
Bart Simpson,"Yeah, you did the right thing... eventually."
Marge Simpson,"Still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck."
Homer Simpson,"Oh, you will, honey. You will."
,
Marge Simpson,$300 for doing nothing?! I feel like such a crook.
George H.W. Bush,Don't worry. Gets easier every week.
